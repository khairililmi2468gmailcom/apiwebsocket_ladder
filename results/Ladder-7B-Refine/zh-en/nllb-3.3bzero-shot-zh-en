Whether there is a way to punish him
So that it doesn't happen again.
Or how long will it be before the restaurant is ready? Could you ask for me?
At the Zhejiang University Academic Conference, the students sang the leading role, and the research results opened up people's minds - Xinhua News Agency
Use air to wash hands, breathe to judge the disease, and precisely search for the sources of smog. Last night, at the opening ceremony of the 2016 Academic Year of Zhejiang University, a series of academic achievements with big ideas were commended.
The main researchers of these achievements were students, covering a wide range of fields such as environment, mechanics, energy, medical, life sciences, humanities education, etc. The students began with a curious idea and created many high-end inventions with application value. Some of the projects have won awards at home and abroad.
Bio-sensors: your home doctor
Zhang Diming, a PhD student in the School of Biomedical Engineering, demonstrated an on-site bio-sensor on a smartphone, which was only half the size of a smartphone.
"All you have to do is take a deep breath, and this instrument can detect your health status from the composition of your exhaled gases. "
Zhang Diming introduced that this set of sensors is connected to smart phones. After exhaling the breath, the health report will be displayed on the mobile phone.
The smart wristbands on the market that can detect health conditions usually detect physical parameters such as temperature and pulse.
This set of biosensors uses a new material, graphene, and its target is chemical elements. Its keen "sense of smell" allows it to more deeply and accurately reflect the body's health status.
Smart surgical lights: doctors' high-energy eyes
In addition to smart phones, smart surgical lights are also being used in the operating room.
The invention won a silver award at the 44th International Exhibition of Inventions of Geneva in Switzerland this year.
The master's students Zhu Linjing and Shen Junfei from the School of Photonics Science and Engineering opened up a new idea in the defects of traditional surgical lamps, and invented a smart LED surgical shadowless lamp.
"Many diseases are not detected early or removed properly, and this is related to the lights used in the doctor's operating room. "
Shen Junfei said, for example, if the doctor can’t see all the tumor tissues in time during the early detection of cancer, then the cancer cells will continue to spread.
The smart surgical light has four light discs, which can be adjusted in the spectrum to enhance the difference between different tissues under illumination.
During the operation, the doctor can adjust the size, brightness, spectrum, color uniformity and shadow-free rate of the light spot at any time according to the needs of the operation and personal habits.
This intelligent surgical lamp has been tested in hospitals such as Zhejiang University School of Medicine Shaoyifu Hospital and Zhejiang University School of Medicine Children's Hospital, and has received good feedback.
Last October, this invention won the first prize of the National Challenge Cup.
Washing hands with air: water-saving and cool
Ordinary people wash their hands with water, at most they wipe some soap, squeeze some hand washing liquid, and Li Qizhang and his classmates invented a set of "air hand washing device".
Just stand on the device's sink, and our weight can compress the air out.
"It's like a defibrillator.
The compressed air forms a stream of fluid at the tap, and combines with the water.
Then we can get our hands clean!"
The visible reaction and the bacteria residue test prove that the effect of washing hands by this method is the same as that of washing hands in the ordinary way.
This device only needs to rely on our own gravity as the driving force, which can ensure the degree of cleaning and save 90% of water. The whole process is completely without energy consumption and energy-saving and environmentally friendly.
Last year, this invention stood out among many of the world's top universities at the 2nd Global Major Challenges Summit and won the only gold award.

A certificate that I thought was very meaningful - the first aid certificate
This is one of the most important skill certificates I hold besides my driver's license!
Here is an explanation: first aid measures are actually emergency rescue measures when a sudden event occurs, i.e. rescue before the arrival of an ambulance.
It is well known that there is actually a period of time before the ambulance arrives after the accident, and it is this period of time that is the most critical.
This is when emergency care is needed.
If I really had a heart attack, stroke, respiratory arrest, then our life window is only four minutes, the golden four minutes!
So how important it is for people around you to know first aid!
When someone falls around us, we can use our professional knowledge to save him, instead of standing there and doing nothing, the feeling of helplessness is terrible.
"In China, according to official statistics, there are 300,000 accidental deaths every year, and the most dangerous one is cardiac arrest.
The national average in the U.S. is about 15 percent.
In Las Vegas, 70 to 80 percent can be saved, while in Shanghai and Beijing it is less than 1 percent."
This was said by Lu Le, the founder of First Response.
If someone is in cardiac arrest, if they're not breathing, if they're not getting a heartbeat, you're not going to do any good by putting your fingers in their throat.
It is only possible to save a person by performing artificial respiration and external chest compressions.
I find that there are not many people who have the awareness to learn first aid now, but when things happen, it is too late, so I still call on everyone to learn this skill, so that we can react in time when we face an emergency.
It might even save a life!
The first aid certificate can be registered at the local Red Cross training center. I registered at the Red Cross training center in Zhuhai. There are discounts for students.
PS: The last picture is a record of the goals I want to complete before I'm 25, and adding a first aid certificate to the list of goals was a few months ago, but I really did it!
Then go to take other certificates that I want to take. I plan to take a diving certificate. I saw a diving first aid certificate on Little Red Book before. It seems that I need a first aid certificate to take this certificate, so the first aid certificate is actually very useful!
I ordered ＃#NUMBER#
Is it 13 yuan for one shrimp dumpling?
I haven't tried it.
How is #NAME# not written clearly?
One for $13?
The #PRS_ORG# forgot to deliver food yesterday. This time, they just gave me a shrimp dumpling to eat!?
Because I could see that it was valid when I entered the code before
First of all, let's talk about the conclusion. I personally think that "Four Seas" is a full-fledged bad movie in every sense of the word.
But you can't say that this movie doesn't have any bright spots, at least the soundtrack is pretty good.
There are many kinds of bad movies. One that makes you fall asleep in the movie theater is one kind. One that makes you feel indignant after watching it is another. "Four Seas" is like a monkey on Emei Mountain to the audience. It can ignite your anger in countless ways.
In terms of insulting the audience, Han Han is truly gifted.
The most painful thing about this film is that it seems to be the creation of a Cthulhu novel, indescribable, and full of loopholes, just like the windbreaker on Little Marco.
Even after watching it, you're left wondering if there is some kind of hidden message from the director, but when you think about it, you realize it's just a pile of crap.
First, I will briefly talk about some of the plots that I don't understand.
The main character's residence should be on a small island to the south, where he lives with his grandmother.
Her grandmother had a wish to see snow, and then the plot arranged for an old man in the neighborhood to take her to the Northeast to see the snow in a small van.
Elderly people sat in a van from south to northeast to see snow?
He and his dad are very reassured about this.
Then, the old man disappeared.
How did the owner's brother get the business license to open a hotel on an abandoned ship?
Why can the little hooligans of the flying car party on the island do a section of mountain road so easily?
Then the truck in the middle of the road stopped by the side of the road, and even the truck drivers could not be found around.
This prop is too obvious, isn't it?
Why would a fly-by-night gang with no credit and suspected of breaking the law become an auxiliary police officer?
Why don’t you call the police when facing usury? The police in the movie even asked if there was any difficulty?
An adult who knows how to use a smartphone but doesn't know how to use a room key to open a hotel door and then forcibly arrange to sleep outside the door of the hotel without finding the hotel owner?
This bizarre plot point is littered throughout the film, so much so that it's painful to recall them.
Worse than the plot is the movie's theme, or lack thereof, which is a hideous Frankenstein's monster.
At the beginning of the film, you will think that he wants to make a comedy. After more than 20 minutes, you will guess that it may be an inspirational film. After watching half of the film, you will think that it may be a plot film that wants to show the difficulty of survival of young people in small towns. After watching it, you don't know what kind of film you have watched, followed by deep doubt about yourself. Why do you have to go to the cinema to appreciate excrement during the Chinese New Year.
In fact, most people are very familiar with the routines of various films. For example, if you want to shoot a motorcyclist, then it will be inspirational + comedy, and then tell the audience how a talented rookie walked step by step to success.
If you want to make a love movie, then you should tell the story of the love-hate relationship between the small-town young man who likes to ride a motorcycle and the waitress girl.
If you want to reflect reality, then at the very least you can't have things in your plot that are at odds with the real world.
(For example, the new motorcycle played by Yin Zheng has just been burnt, and then he can sing), you can't open some brain holes that even Kennedy couldn't stand.
As for the fact that the heroine is clearly not retarded but acts like a 5-year-old in some ways, I really don't know if it's because of her acting or because of the director's requirements.
There is another thing that I don't quite understand. As a race car driver, why is Han Han so keen to add car crash scenes to his own films?
This kind of film arrangement in the Spring Festival, is it to add trouble to the audience?

Inspection well concrete module production and processing equipment Zhengzhou well wall brick module equipment introduction:
Zhengzhou Yixin is a domestic concrete inspection well module brick machine device, inspection well brick machine, well wall wall module machine professional manufacturer, from semi-automatic to fully automated production line.
After years of practice and development, it has now developed a series of high-quality products, including hydraulic, mobile, and fully-automatic inspection well devices and supporting devices.
Check the production and processing equipment of the well concrete module Zhengzhou well-wall brick module equipment assembly site:
Inspection of the concrete module production and processing equipment Zhengzhou well wall brick module equipment characteristics and advantages:
Yixin inspection well-block machine equipment is widely suitable for the new building materials of municipal underground structures such as coal, heat, water, electricity, and gas.
Such as various inspection wells of drainage, water storage facilities, rain drains, square ditches, septic tanks and small constructions, wing walls of bridges, etc.
The advantage of using concrete modules to build the inspection well is that the upper, lower, left and right sides of the modules are all concave and convex groove structures, and they are combined to form a chain lock.
The shear strength of the well wall is far better than that of the plain friction masonry.
The module is a hollow structure. After the combination is built, the vertical holes are connected and the horizontal holes are connected. After the core is cast, it forms a cast-in-place concrete grid structure, which plays the role of secondary reinforcement and waterproofing.
Both horizontal and vertical grooves are provided for inserting reinforcement bars, and the horizontal and vertical reinforcement bars accordingly improve the overall strength of the structure.
In addition, the inspection wells and drainage wells built with concrete inspection well modules are not prone to collapse, subsidence, and leakage. The mechanical properties of the well wall modules are stable, the operation is simple, and the formed size is standard.
The concrete inspection well module brick machine equipment is equipped with intelligent control, data input and output device, one-key touch-screen liquid crystal display to monitor the entire process of mechanical operation, realize ideal human-machine dialogue, automatic analysis of materials, density operation, safe logic control and fault diagnosis system.
The mechanical hydraulic system of the well wall module uses single-cylinder hydraulic transmission and double-cylinder hydraulic transmission.
The independent hydraulic integration station avoids the impact of the host's vibration on the hydraulic system, so as to ensure the reliability of the hydraulic system.
The concrete inspection well module, brick machine, equipment, cloth box, moving mold box, demoulding, rising, storage box door closing, automatic conveyor plate, and all of them are independently completed by the hydraulic system, so as to achieve the purpose of reducing the wear and maintenance of the machinery.
The concrete inspection well module brick machine device uses imported computers and electrical appliances, sealed and hydraulic components, and the comprehensive performance of the device is stable and reliable.
The mechanical vibration platform of the well wall body module is made of a whole steel plate, and the line cutting ratio of the platform is made without a welding point, so that the filler box can swing freely in the direction, and fully reduce the mechanical wear.
to reduce the mold load, fill and two-in-one encrypt amplitude, use one-piece, all-synchronous, platform vibration and mold vibration to ensure that the vibration effect is achieved.
The wall module of the well wall is mechanically vibrated mechanically, and the computer automatically controls the amplitude to adjust the amplitude according to the cost-effectiveness of the raw materials. There is no wear-free braking, which extends the service life and reduces the cost.
The wall body module of the well wall has dual functions of mechanical automatic control and manual control.

Chongqing’s secondary vocational schools pilot the modern apprenticeship system, and admission is equivalent to being an employee of an enterprise – Xinhua News Agency
Yesterday, the reporter learned from the municipal education commission that this year, the city will pilot the "modern apprenticeship" talent training model in 60 vocational and technical schools, and the students who participate in the pilot training will simultaneously have the status of apprentices. After enrollment, they will be pre-enrolled by the pilot enterprises as employees of the unit.
The Municipal Education Bureau required that the enrollment and admission procedures of secondary vocational schools and the employment procedures of enterprises be standardized, and the dual identities of apprentices in secondary vocational schools and enterprise candidates be clarified. According to the two-way choice principle, apprentices, schools and enterprises should sign a three-party agreement. For apprentices who have reached the age of 16 and have not reached the age of 18, an agreement should be signed by four parties, including apprentices, guardians, schools and enterprises, to determine the rights and interests of each party and the specific posts, teaching content, rights and interests protection, etc. of apprentices during on-the-job training.
Encourage pilot schools to adopt the form of modern apprenticeship to carry out pre-job training and transfer training for enterprise employees in cooperation with cooperating enterprises.
The pilot schools need to reform the talent training model.
The school and the enterprise jointly design the talent training plan, jointly formulate professional teaching standards, course standards, post standards, enterprise master standards, quality monitoring standards and corresponding implementation plans.
The pilot program is based on a training cycle. The student's internship time in the enterprise is determined according to the professional talent training scheme, and the on-the-job internship is usually 6 months.
In business practice, the enterprise group management mode should be implemented. According to the characteristics of different professions, 1 master can take 2 to 5 apprentices to form a learning group to ensure that students master the skills required for each training post.
According to the arrangement, from 2016 to August 2019, 60 city-level modern apprenticeship pilot programs will be determined in three batches, with about 50 people in each pilot program, and about 3,000 students (apprentices) will be trained in total.
According to the principle of first pilot and then implementation, from point to face, gradually promote, explore the establishment of long-term mechanism of school-enterprise joint enrollment, joint training and integrated education, effectively improve students' job skills, improve students' employment rate and employment quality.

South African doctors: Omicron is highly transmissible but mostly mild
Many doctors and medical experts in South Africa believe that the symptoms caused by the Omicron variant of the new coronavirus are milder than those caused by the Delta variant, although it spreads faster.
According to the Associated Press, as the Omicron variant spreads in South Africa, a group of more than 5,000 doctors in the Gauteng province of South Africa reported that the symptoms of the COVID-19 patients they are currently treating are relatively mild, such as body pain and cough, similar to flu-like symptoms.
Dr. Unben Pillay, the head of the organization, says he sees dozens of patients a day, but none of them need to be hospitalized.
Pyle said: "They are able to control the disease at home and most people recover within 10 to 14 days of isolation. "
That includes older patients and those with health conditions, who are more likely to become severely ill from COVID-19.
In comparison, in the last wave of the delta epidemic, the new coronavirus patients he treated had "difficulty breathing and low blood oxygen levels.
Many of them have to be admitted to the hospital within a few days."
Other doctors have also shared similar experiences in the two weeks since the Omicron variant was first reported in southern Africa.
Although it will take several weeks to gather enough data, doctors' observations and early evidence provide some clues.
According to the South African National Institute of Communicable Diseases, only 30% of the newly hospitalized COVID-19 patients in recent weeks have severe symptoms, which is half of the proportion of severe symptoms in the previous wave of the epidemic; the average hospital stay has been reduced from 8 days to 2.8 days; only 3% of the recent COVID-19 patients have died, while the proportion of deaths in the early outbreak of COVID-19 in South Africa was as high as 20%.
"At the moment, almost all the evidence suggests it's a milder disease," said Willem Hanekom, director of the African Health Research Institute, citing data from the National Institute for Communicable Diseases and other reports.
He added: "It's still early days, we need to get the late data.
In general, hospitalizations and deaths happen later, and we're only two weeks into this wave. "
At the same time, scientists around the world are observing case numbers and hospitalizations, as well as testing the effectiveness of current vaccines and treatments.
While Delta remains the dominant coronavirus strain worldwide, Omicron cases are emerging in dozens of countries, with South Africa as the epicentre.
According to health officials, new cases discovered in the first week of December in the province of Gauteng increased by 400%, and tests showed that more than 90% of the cases were caused by the omicron variant.
Thanks to today's supporters, all 80 boxes were sent out!

Education Commentary: What does it take to save abducted children?
If we compare it with the famous public service advertisement "There is no killing without buying", in a good environment where there is no demand for "rescuing children", group prevention and group governance, and anti-trafficking by the whole people will make the trafficking behavior unprofitable, high risk and high cost, so this kind of crime will not happen again and again.
Recently, the Ministry of Public Security’s Criminal Investigation Bureau launched an emergency release platform for missing children developed by the Anti-Trafficking Department.
This is an Internet information platform set up to establish an authoritative channel for the release of information on missing children and to find abducted children in a timely manner.
After hearing the name of the app was "reunion", I felt very warm.
The new technological means not only have the name of "literature and art" and are full of feelings, but also use information well, and are practical and effective.
The first goal of anti-begging enforcement is to find the children who have been trafficked and to protect their personal safety and freedom.
Then is the trial and punishment of the suspect.
The meaning of criminal punishment can be listed as many "big words" from individual punishment, social prevention to legal education.
However, before a trafficking case is solved, the safety of the victims should be prioritized.
Matters are divided into light and heavy, and urgent and non-urgent. Under the urgent purpose of "looking for help", controversial topics such as "whether all child trafficking should be sentenced to death" can be put aside for the time being and discussed with caution, but the matter of rescuing the abducted children cannot wait.
According to the investigation experience of such cases, the traffickers are accustomed to leaving the crime scene as soon as possible after getting their hands on the victims.
If the search is delayed by one minute, the child may be one step away from the parent, and the difficulty of solving the case will increase by one point.
In this case, it is indeed a pragmatic move to come up with an effective method like the "Reunion" platform that directly helps solve cases and find back children.
After all, “anti-begging” is a big task that requires the operation of the entire legal system.
To combat crime and protect the rights and interests of children and parents, from the improvement of legislation, to the protection of justice, and the carefulness of law enforcement, there is no need to implement the care of "protecting children and helping the weak".
In addition, the prevention of child trafficking can be better from family to society.
For example, in a common case, a family of three was resting at the train station, the parents fell asleep, and when they woke up, they found that the child was gone.
You can't expect a two-year-old to have enough self-protection skills, but as a parent of a young child, you should at least have a sense of protection.
Parents taking turns to rest, or keeping their children in a safe place, are the most basic means to prevent children from being kidnapped.
From the other side of the police's crackdown on trafficking crimes, the buyers of trafficked children should also be paid attention to and punished.
An individual act of wrongdoing is often just one link in a long chain.
According to China’s Criminal Law, the minimum sentence for child trafficking is 5 years; in particularly serious cases, the death penalty may be imposed, and property may be confiscated.
The sentencing range is high, and the maximum sentence is heavy. In the trend of “lightening punishment”, the crime of buying and selling children obviously belongs to the category of serious crimes.
However, there are still a lot of trafficking cases every year.
It can be seen that some people are behind the times in their ideas about raising children, and their legal awareness is weak.
The legal education for this group of people should keep up with it.
To effectively control trafficking crimes, it is not enough to rely solely on official law enforcement.
If the market for abducting and selling children is widespread, the traffickers will be greedy and constantly innovate their methods of trafficking, forming a "struggle" situation with the law enforcement authorities, and the anti-trafficking actions will inevitably fall into an inefficient quagmire.
Therefore, breaking the backward concept and popularizing legal common sense can also help to eradicate the trafficking and buying and selling of children.

Actually, I don't know if it was the store's mistake or the rider's mistake
There were no documents on the bag.

I hope you understand
Because the delivery time is 30 minutes ahead of the display

The International Olive Oil Association divides olive oil into two large categories, virgin olive oil (Virgin Olive Oil) and refined olive oil (Lampante Olive Oil or Refined Olive Oil), and five levels.
Extra virgin olive oil or natural olive oil is the oil obtained directly from fresh olive fruit by mechanical cold pressing and then filtered to remove impurities.
It is divided into three levels according to its acidity:
Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO): This is the highest level and the best quality of olive oil, which is a pure natural product.
It tastes great, with a mild and pleasant plant aroma, and an acidity of no more than 1%.
Fine Virgin Olive Oil (FVO): slightly higher in acidity, but not exceeding 2%, pure and aromatic in taste.
Ordinary virgin olive oil (Ordinary Virgin): The taste and flavor are acceptable, and the acidity is no more than 3.3%.
Refined olive oil is the olive oil obtained after the refining of extra virgin olive oil with an acidity of more than 3.3%, or the "secondary oil".
Refined olive oil comes in two grades:
Common olive oil (Olive Oil): A mixture of refined olive oil and a certain proportion of virgin olive oil to harmonize the taste and color, with an acidity of less than 1.5%, and a transparent pale golden yellow.
Refined Olive-Pomace Oil or Olive-Pomace Oil: This is olive oil obtained by solvent extraction from the pomace and then refined.
If you've looked at the classification, you should already have discovered that the acidity of olive oil is a very important indicator.
After all, like grapes used to make wine, olives from different regions and different varieties of olives will produce different standards of olive oil.
The best place to grow oil olives:
The Mediterranean coast has the most suitable soil, temperature, sunlight, air humidity and precipitation for the growth of oil olives.
Except for the Mediterranean coast, other regions can only be planted sporadically in suitable areas.
Main production areas (Mediterranean):
Italy, Spain, Greece, Turkey, Portugal, Morocco, Syria, Israel, Tunisia, Algeria, Egypt, Pakistan, Lebanon, Argentina, Peru, South Africa, and other places with similar climate are far away in the southern hemisphere.
Harvest month of the olive:
March to June each year is the time for olive trees to bloom and bear fruit. The fruit begins to develop and mature from July to October, and the fruit changes from green to red, purple, and finally black.
November to February is the harvest season (the freshness of the olive oil is very important).
The nutritional composition of olive oil:
Olive oil is rich in healthy monounsaturated fatty acids such as oleic acid and linoleic acid, as well as vitamin A, vitamin B, vitamin D, vitamin E, vitamin K, and antioxidants.
Olive oil is considered to be the most suitable oil for human nutrition of all the oils discovered so far.
Summit for Democracy ends with Biden saying the flame of freedom will never be extinguished
The online “Summit for Democracy”, convened by US President Joe Biden and attended by government leaders, civil society and private sector leaders from 110 countries around the world, ended on Friday (December 10).
Biden said in his closing remarks that the fire of freedom burns in the heart of every person in the world, and authoritarian regimes will never be able to extinguish it.
He also said that the second Global "Democratic Summit" will be held next year.
On the second day of the summit, representatives of the Taiwan government, Tang Fenghe, and Hong Kong democracy and human rights activist, Law Ka-chung, who is currently in exile in the UK, also spoke.
Mr. Biden said: "We know what a monumental task lies ahead of us.
But we also know that we can meet the challenge, as I've said before and as this summit has shown, democracy is everywhere.
The flame of freedom can never be extinguished by a repressive regime. It burns in the hearts and minds of people all over the world. "
Biden also said that defending democracy requires the joint efforts of the whole society.
He said: "As leaders of the government, we have a duty to listen to our citizens, strengthen the fence of democracy, promote reform, achieve transparent and accountable governance, and resist the power of authoritarianism and those who want to pursue power nakedly before the public interest. "
The second day of the "Democracy Summit" focused on defending human rights, consolidating democracy and countering authoritarianism, and countering digital authoritarianism and affirming democratic values.
This day coincides with the International Human Rights Day.
UN Secretary-General Guterres also said in his opening remarks on the same day that the cause of democracy is facing challenges around the world, especially the challenges brought by emerging digital technologies.
He said: "Now is the time to reaffirm our shared values and positions and the resilience of democracy.
This requires deepening social dialogue, addressing inequality, fighting corruption, updating social contracts, investing in quality education, and expanding opportunities for women and girls.
This also requires a resolute condemnation of all forms of populism, nationalism, and extremism, including the use of all the tools provided by the technological revolution."
Hong Kong democracy and human rights activist, Law Ka-chung, made a speech at the summit through a pre-recorded video, reminding participants to continue to pay attention to the human rights situation in Hong Kong and China's minority ethnic groups such as the Uyghurs and Tibetans.
He said: "For a long time, the world has been directly affected by China's rise, but no mechanism has been established to hold it accountable.
That is why politicians and civil society leaders must work together.
We must use all we have (resources) to ensure that the revival of democracy is our top priority. "
Law Ka-chung also called on the free world to unite against the threat of the Chinese Communist Party.
He said: "Maybe some of you are afraid of offending General Secretary Xi Jinping, maybe some of you don't want to lose the Chinese market, and maybe some of you don't realize the threat of (the CCP) to our democratic values.
And that is why we failed.
That's why we need to change."
Tang Feng, a member of the Executive Yuan of Taiwan, attended the roundtable discussion on "Combating Digital Dictatorship and Affirming Democratic Values" and released the "National Declaration" through video, emphasizing that Taiwan is at the forefront of fighting against despotism and authoritarianism.
He also shared his experience in combating COVID-19 through information transparency and building mutual trust.
He said: "At a time when Taiwan's democracy is on the rise, we are determined to stand at the forefront of the global fight against authoritarianism, and to play a leading role in promoting global freedom, democracy and human rights.
During the pandemic, authoritarian governments around the world have justified human rights violations in the name of public health and collective interests, and global democracy has shown signs of retrogression.
However, in Taiwan, we can control the epidemic without city-wide lockdowns, and we can defeat fake news without pulling them down. "
On the second day of the “Democracy Summit”, the U.S. Department of the Treasury announced that it would legally impose sanctions on 15 individuals and 10 entities in several countries, including China and North Korea, which were considered to have seriously violated human rights, and simultaneously imposed investment restrictions on a Chinese company that was considered to have used surveillance technology to assist in the violation of human rights.
I've already taken pictures and uploaded them to you
I know.
But the restaurant didn't know why the delivery kept getting pushed back.
Originally #NUMBER#
In any case, I won't call anymore.
I'm done
I'm going to complain
Why didn’t you say it earlier if you can’t send it?
Waiting for you for so long
No, I didn't get a call
Please ask him to send it to our company again
I don't want to wait another #NUMBER# minutes

I want to cancel my order
Why not cancel?
Hey, the chicken sent by the restaurant is raw
I wanted to try tennis, but I was afraid that I wouldn't be able to stick with it, so I wanted to try something with a similar price first.
They are not friendly, in fact, the price is often directly proportional to the friendliness. If you can’t tell the difference, the expensive ones will normally be more friendly than the cheap ones. These "entry-level cameras" are actually industrial garbage.
They are very weak, the ball hits the paddle, the vibration is very large, the hard ball can't stand it, and it's difficult for experts to control.
The logic and subtext of their existence is that tennis is so difficult, they know you won’t learn it, and they also know you won’t spend a lot of money on it, so they give you a cheap one, you play it twice, and you won’t play it again, so this racket is cheap, and you won’t feel bad.
When you can really tell the difference between good and bad, it means that you have improved, and then you can buy the expensive ones from me, and I will earn twice the money.
It is recommended to spend a similar price to buy a better second-hand tennis racket, choose Prince or Donic. These two brands are not famous enough, so good tennis rackets are not expensive. A new tennis racket costs 500 or 600, and a second-hand tennis racket costs 200. Isn’t it nice to have a thousand-yuan tennis racket?
It is friendly to novices, but it is useless after the novice stage. However, most people, especially girls, can't pass the novice stage.
The order has been delayed several times
May I ask if you can help follow up?
postponed
Thank you
In other words, I already have credit?
Do I need to reorder? Do I just ignore the original order?

In fact, there are many things to pay attention to in dressing and matching for slightly fat girls.
Girls who are fat should not wear skirts that are too short or too long. The length should be around the knee, just enough to cover the fat on the thighs.
A skirt that is too short will reveal the fat on your legs.
If it's too long, it can make you look short and fat.
If you wear it in the upper, middle and lower sections, it will make you look taller naturally. That is, the upper body, skirt and long stockings are in different colors, and it will create a sense of slenderness.
In fact, many dark-colored clothes are the standard for slightly fat girls (the author has a deep understanding of this), and dark colors are also a good way to cover up your body fat. High-end and elegant black short skirts are also the first choice of slightly fat girls.
Wearing dark-coloured clothes, especially black skirts, will make you look slimmer.
If you have fat calves, don't wear socks and shoes that call attention to them.
The more popular it is, the better, and the color should not be too bright.
In order not to make people feel fat when they pay attention to your legs and feet.
Girls who are slightly chubby need to know the trick of dressing well.
Micro-fat girls must not wear tight short skirts, and the top must not be too short or tucked into the skirt, which will make people feel very uncomfortable. If your legs are thick, you should wear black long stockings or mesh stockings (the kind with fine grids), choose a soft-textured printed trumpet skirt, and match it with a collarless top, which can well cover the shortcomings of fat girls.
Of course, the micro-fat girl is also very particular about wearing short skirts.
If you are a fat girl wearing a short skirt, you should choose a top with the same color as the short skirt. This will give you the effect of increasing the height of your fat body.
Wearing short skirts with high heels will make your legs look more slender, which is the most popular combination in summer!
If you are a woman with a fat upper body and thin legs, it is recommended that you choose a gorgeous one-piece short skirt.
Not only can it cover the big belly, but it can also show your advantages.
A-line short skirts will make you look thinner, and it is more suitable for chubby girls. The tops should be tighter to form a sense of layers, which will make you look thinner.
A simple white T-shirt with short skirt, fat girls can also try it.
Even chubby girls can wear fashionable clothes.
As long as you can master the rules of dressing and matching, micro-fat girls will also be the focus of everyone's attention.
After making changes in dressing, you should also exercise more in your daily life, and try to get rid of the label of being a slightly fat girl as soon as possible.

Xinhua Plus | Beijing youth ice hockey league ignites Winter Olympic enthusiasm - Xinhua Net

A girl uses her body as a target to raise money for her sister: "I feel better when I think of it as just a flesh wound" - China News Service
In Wulin Square in Hangzhou, a girl stands in front of a large wooden board, on which the words "human meat target, ten yuan per arrow" are written.
Yesterday morning, a photo of a "Hangzhou girl willing to be the "target" to raise funds for her sister" went viral on social media.
The photo shows a girl standing in front of a wooden board a little taller than a person in Hangzhou Wulin Square. The words "human target, ten yuan per arrow" are written on the wooden board, indicating that passers-by can use a bow and arrow after paying.
This action aroused heated discussion among netizens.
Last night, the publicity official of the Lower City Branch of the Hangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau confirmed to the Beijing News reporter that the police had confirmed that the girl had made such an extreme move in order to raise money for her sister, but this behavior was not worth advocating. After being warned, the girl left the local police station yesterday.
Girl's street 'dartboard' charity appeal warned
In the image circulating on the Internet, a long-haired girl stands in front of a large wooden board, on which is written “human target, 10 yuan for an arrow” in black ink. On the other board in front of her is written her bank account and WeChat and Alipay accounts.
The image has caused controversy since it went online.
Some netizens believed that this move was "begging for eyeballs", and many netizens expressed their sympathy.
“We found the situation at around 10 a.m. on the 23rd. At that time, there were already a lot of onlookers. ”
A police officer from Tian Shui police station near the scene said in an interview with local media that there were two girls selling goods, both in their 20s and dressed in a youthful and beautiful style.
Among them, the girl who played the "human target" kept crying and asked passers-by to play this game; another girl helped to shout on the side, saying that her friend's sister had leukemia and urgently needed surgery fees, and asked everyone to help.
"We contacted the local police in Guizhou and learned that the girl was raising money for her sister's leukemia treatment. "
Last night, the publicity director of the Lower City Branch of the Hangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau told the Beijing News reporter that the girl’s name was Jijiali, and she was collecting money for her sister Jijiayan.
However, due to the fact that treatment still costs more than 300,000 yuan, he could not think of a good way to raise funds, so he did such a thing.
He said that during the whole process, one of the two girls was used as a target, and the other was responsible for helping, but did not participate in it. During the whole process, no one was found to shoot an arrow, but some people watched and took pictures and posted them on Weibo.
Later, the police identified the bow and arrow used was not subject to control.
The official said that "it is not advisable to adopt this kind of eye-catching fundraising method".
She had left the police station after being warned by a police officer.

The new machine is very good.
The performance is stable, and there are no problems with the four air outlets for heat dissipation. It is worth recommending.
The Acer Predator Helios 300 gaming laptop is pretty good. The workmanship and materials are sufficient, and it's a trustworthy brand!
The price of the Acer Predator Helios 300 is not expensive.
Personally, I think the Acer Shadow Knight Dragon is really good, and the game effect: the game effect is comfortable and can play most games. My eating chicken is all high ** frame rate and stable, which is very smooth. LOL is not in the words. CSGO is also easy to handle, and most three-A games can be played.

It has a beautiful appearance and good configuration.
I bought it for my nephew. I wanted to wait for the 418 bank event, but he needed it urgently, so I bought it in advance, so I didn't catch the bank's big event, which is a little regretful.
However, it has a good cost performance, and the logistics is fast. I will come back to evaluate it after using it for a period of time.
This is a brand new gaming laptop with high cost-effectiveness. The design style is very good, and it has already installed Windows 11 and Office 2019.

It's not bad. The graphics of the game are really fragrant.
What's hot in 2021?
Undoubtedly, it was the Tokyo Olympics.
Do you think that only Olympic athletes can win awards?
Recently, there was an article called "Look! Project managers can compete for a gold medal in the Olympic Games", which was very popular. It mentioned that project managers can take the lead in many projects, and no one can match them: moving bricks, going on business trips, staying up late is the daily routine of project managers. Fire fighting, taking the blame, and apologizing are not to be mentioned.
The article that seems to be a joke also reveals the daily bitterness of the project managers, which represents the powerlessness of the current project management work.
Those who work in project management are also gradually choosing to take some action to get themselves out of the predicament of work.
Judging from the increasing number of people applying for the PMP (an international certification for project management professionals) every year, more and more project management professionals are learning to improve their project management skills.
According to the 20-year Development Report on Project Management in China (1999-2019), by September 2019, the total number of PMP® applicants in the country reached nearly 600,000, the number of those who passed the PMP® certification was about 420,000, and the number of effective certificate holders was about 300,000, accounting for 31.2% of the total number of PMP® certificate holders in the world.
Over the past ten years, the number of PMP certificate holders has increased year by year, indicating that more and more project managers have realized that it is no longer advisable to do things by simply copying the "old experience" of the past. The ever-changing work environment tells us that we need to learn to stand on the shoulders of scientific giants to explore the way forward.
However, does obtaining the PMP guarantee that project management work will go smoothly?
Many project management beginners say that they can systematically master the knowledge points of the ten fields and five process groups of project management by learning related courses such as PMP/IPMP, but they are still at a loss when they really do project management work.
Many project managers often feedback the following problems: Project management is not in place, relying solely on personal experience, empty project management theory, do not know how to put it into practice; Lack of systematic project management process system support, unable to implement in work, project estimation is not accurate, control sensitivity is poor, the project is dragged on and on; Member division of labor is unclear, the “old oil” in the team does not know how to deal with it; Cross-departmental cooperation communication is not smooth, and it is difficult to promote the project...

Jinshi advocates rational consumption to consumers on the eve of 12.12 - Economic Observer Network - Professional Financial News Website
This year's "Double 11" carnival, the national network payment business transaction amount reached 1.77 trillion yuan, which is a new high compared to previous years.
The various discounted coupons and the live streaming of goods have once again made consumers exclaim that they have gained benefits. This wave of consumerism has not only made people admire the increasingly strong national consumption, but also has to calm down and think about the impact of consumerism on society and the contemporary mainstream consumer group.
On the eve of “12.12”, Xinxin Consumer Finance Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as “Xinxin”) issued a call for rational consumption, reminding the general public, especially young people, to establish good consumption awareness and consumption habits, and refuse blind consumption and over-consumption.
According to the results of the Consumer Financial Literacy Survey and Analysis Report released by the People's Bank of China this year, the national consumer financial literacy index is 66.81, an increase of 2.04 compared with 2019.
Overall, the performance of residents in financial consumption is good, but there are large differences in financial behavior and skills, and it is necessary to further improve the level of basic financial knowledge.
The elderly and young people have a relatively low level of financial literacy. "One old and one young" will continue to be the focus of financial education; the "Report on the Debt Situation of Young People in China" released by Nielsen and the "2019-2020 China Youth Consumption Report" released by CCTV Finance show that young people have huge consumption potential. Credit consumption has become an important way to upgrade consumption. 86.6% of young people are using credit products, and nearly half of them do not have debt accumulation. Although young people as a whole present a trend of rational consumption, which is very different from the label of "excessive waste" given by the outside world, some young people do have over-consumption and follow-the-crowd behavior, which has resulted in huge financial pressure and debt risk, and even led to the gradual increase of social problems. Financial enterprises should dare to assume social responsibility and carry out positive guidance.
As a licensed consumer finance institution, Jietong has always been committed to providing quality and caring services to help people build their own happy lives. It advocates consumers to establish a good and correct consumption concept, and actively responds to regulatory calls to improve the rational consumption awareness of consumers, especially young people.
For many years, CITIC has been carrying out all-round and diversified financial popularization activities for young groups including college students, and through cooperation with top domestic universities, it has launched innovative practice competitions in various forms to subtly guide the consumption needs of young groups, help them establish a rational consumption concept, rationally plan their consumption needs, and thus help them accumulate life wealth.
At the time of Double 12, ZTE reminds all consumer friends to establish reasonable consumption awareness and correct money views, resist blind consumption and over-consumption, and avoid consumption borrowing errors, so as to avoid affecting personal credit and future economic life.
When consuming, you must plan in advance, act according to your ability, and repay on time.
If overdue, the overdue record will be recorded in the personal credit report, which may have a negative impact on future economic life such as buying a car and buying a house.
At the same time, when enjoying financial products and services, one should choose regular institutions and channels, and check whether the relevant institutions have the qualification to operate.
In the future, CITIC will continue to rely on its mature and reliable consumer finance system and constantly updated financial products to provide consumers with more demand-oriented and diversified services, constantly help the public improve their financial knowledge level, help consumers cultivate the concept of rational consumption and moderate borrowing, and become a trustworthy consumer finance partner for consumers.

Vietnam People's Daily Network - The Gulf Cooperation Council responds to common challenges
Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's stops include Oman, United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, Bahrain and Kuwait.
Notably, it is the first visit to Qatar by the crown prince since Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies imposed a blockade on Qatar in mid-2017, leading to the Gulf diplomatic crisis.
In the crisis, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt severed diplomatic relations with Qatar and imposed a total embargo on it, accusing Qatar of supporting terrorist organizations and having close ties with Iran.
Diplomatic tensions have seriously affected the internal unity of the ASEAN, and had a negative impact on the economy of the countries in the region.
Four Arab nations have blocked Qatar's land, sea and air routes.
The crisis was only resolved at the 2021 Gulf Cooperation Council summit in January, when the Gulf states signed an agreement to move towards "unity and stability," brokered by the United States and Kuwait.
Saudi Arabia has reopened its border with Qatar.
Saudi Arabia and Egypt are leading efforts to restore relations with Qatar by appointing new ambassadors to the country.
The Gulf Arab states' efforts to resolve their differences and restore relations with Qatar stem from the need to unite for the interests of their countries and regional stability and to face common challenges.
During the visit of the Saudi Crown Prince to Oman, the two sides agreed to open the first direct land route between the two Gulf neighbors.
The 725-kilometer long channel connecting the two countries will provide convenient conditions for the travel of citizens of the two countries and the integration of supply chains.
Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) will invest $5 billion in Oman, and the two countries have signed 13 memoranda of understanding (MoU) worth $30 billion.
The Saudi crown prince's visit to the Gulf states comes as Iran and world powers negotiate to save the 2015 Iran nuclear agreement, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), a deal that Gulf Arab states have condemned as failing to address their concerns about Iran's missile program.
The Gulf countries have always regarded Iran as a long-term "competitor", and regarded Iran's nuclear program as a "threat" to regional security.
Each of the Gulf states believes that it is flawed not to solve the Iranian missile problem and not to take action to curb Iran's activities in the region.
In the background of the major countries and Iran nuclear negotiations failed to meet the wishes of the Gulf countries, Saudi Arabia and Iran conducted direct negotiations.
Its goal is to prevent the escalation of tensions in the region.
This has been one of the factors slowing economic growth in GCC countries.
The upcoming GCC summit will be the first GCC summit since the end of the dispute between some member states and Qatar.
This is an opportunity for the Gulf Cooperation Council to reassess its diplomatic achievements to promote the restoration of the unity of the Gulf Cooperation Council and propose measures for its member states to fully cooperate to meet common challenges and contribute to the stability and development of Gulf countries.

It is said to be the loudest sports car in the New Mountain area!
The car we brought to you this time is the dream of many men!
It is the flagship supercar of Lamborghini, the Murcielago's successor - the Aventador LP700-4!
The price is close to two million ringgits, and the annual road tax is tens of thousands of ringgits. It has four-wheel drive. Why is it called LP700?
With 700 horsepower, can you imagine how fast that is?
Forget it, I don’t know. The data says that it only takes 2.9 seconds to accelerate from 0 to 100 km/h. It’s probably when my myvi reaches 30 km/h, it has reached 100 km/h. Well.
The low body, the arrogant scissor doors, the huge air intakes all over the body, and the 6.5 v12 engine that can be seen through the glass, perfectly interpret the style of Lamborghini.
There's not much to say about the description of the car. Just Google it yourself. We have compiled some explanations that Google may not give!
Too much attention, wherever you go everyone is looking at you, it's not comfortable! (Actually it's a bit of fun)
1km of fuel costs around RM1 (the car owner doesn't care at all)
Practice getting in and out or it will be a bit embarrassing (because you won't be able to climb out of the car and will get stuck halfway)
The engine is too loud, and after getting out of the car, you will suddenly be deafened. (But it's very cool.)
The car is too big, it is very narrow when parked in a normal parking space, and it is afraid of being knocked by the neighbor's car when opening the door!
A little lonely, because there were no opponents on the road (I said it myself, it has nothing to do with the car owner, haha)
Don't get it wrong, the supercar in the video is not for sale, sorry!
Friends who want to shoot a video for your car are welcome to contact us!

Let the university spirit resonate with the spirit of the times - Xinhua Net
The so-called university spirit refers to a series of educational ideas and value pursuits formed by a university in the process of development, which is the soul of the university.
From ancient times to the present, university spirit has been crucial to the development of politics, economy, culture, technology, and society, as well as to the progress of a nation.
From the birth of the world’s first modern university, the university has shouldered a unique mission different from other social organizations. For Chinese universities, which were born in the autumn of national crisis, its spirit is more deeply influenced by traditional culture and the changes of the times. It advocates the value concept of “cultivating morality and benefiting the world” and the patriotic responsibility of “promoting education and strengthening the country”.
At present, the trend of informatization and internationalization of higher education is increasingly obvious. The global education competition, technology competition and talent competition are intensifying. As an important “supply side” of higher education, its structural reform is facing unprecedented opportunities and challenges.
In particular, the release of the "Overall Plan for the Construction of World-class Universities and First-class Disciplines" has not only demonstrated the confidence and determination of our country to move from a major higher education country to a strong higher education country, but also put forward higher and newer requirements for the development of universities.
How can we make efforts to become one of the world’s most popular universities in a short period of time, and speed up the construction of several world-class universities and a number of world-class disciplines on the basis of a certain gap, and achieve "overtaking on a bend"?
In addition to the confidence in goals, confidence in paths, and confidence in ability, universities should also make full use of three advantages: first, the latecomer advantage, through continuous introduction of outstanding overseas academic talents, learning and borrowing the advanced experience of world-class universities to achieve a significant improvement in academic level and quality of education; second, cultural advantage, inheriting the wisdom connotation of five thousand years of Chinese civilization, promoting the development of excellent traditional culture, so as to gather strength, build brands, and enhance image; third, institutional advantage, making full use of the institutional superiority of socialist countries, strengthening goal-driven, gathering consensus and strength, optimizing resource allocation, and providing sustainable and solid guarantee for schools to catch up with the world's advanced level.
It is particularly important to realize that it is impossible to build a world-class university in a thousand schools. All schools must show their individuality and characteristics while playing their advantages.
The educational characteristics must have common Chinese characteristics, and also reflect their own unique goals, educational traditions and resource endowments.
As for Zhejiang University, we focus on three aspects in our education. First, we focus on the characteristics of cultivating innovative and entrepreneurial talents. We build an integrated education environment for the integration of science and education and the integration of schools and enterprises to form a full-chain entrepreneurial education ecosystem. Second, we focus on the characteristics of interdisciplinary convergence. We promote the optimization and adjustment of the discipline system, create an institutional environment for interdisciplinary convergence, and actively cultivate emerging interdisciplinary disciplines and landmark interdisciplinary achievements. Third, we focus on the characteristics of the education system and social service. We carry out in-depth international exchange and cooperation, and accelerate the formation of a pan-Zhejiang University R&D cooperation system.
In this process, it is particularly important to always adhere to the university spirit and let the university spirit resonate with the spirit of the times.
For Zhejiang University, "seeking truth and innovation" school motto, "learning, virtue, discernment, and dedication" common values, as well as "embracing the Yangtze River and the Yellow River, seeking truth and virtue, opening things and people, and building our country" constitute the latest expression system of the spirit of Zhejiang University.
This is an important guarantee for the school to adhere to the correct educational direction and continuously accumulate cultural height and spiritual power. It is rich in connotation and profound in meaning.
Among them, "Hai Na River" emphasizes the spirit of openness and inclusiveness, embodies the spirit of "using the talents of the world", and shows the quality concept of drawing on the high-quality education and education of world-renowned universities. "Qi Zhen Huode" emphasizes the spirit of seeking truth and goodness, that is, universities should not only pursue truth, but also accept the cultivation of virtue and the sharpening of personality. "Kai Wu Qian Min" embodies the spirit of reform and innovation, which contains both the pursuit of new knowledge and the innovation of scientific research, and also shows the reform and development, and the overthrow of the old and the new. "Shu Wo Bang Guo" emphasizes the spirit of patriotism and dedication, which talks about the fact that universities should always be associated with the fate and glory of the nation.
This series of spiritual ideas and value pursuit is the soul of Zhejiang University's 120-year education.
"The wise listen in silence and the intelligent see before it takes shape."
Chinese colleges and universities should further base themselves on the overall socialist cause with Chinese characteristics, deeply understand the time position and historical mission of higher education, and accelerate the construction of world-class universities.
At the same time, we must adhere to humanistic care and independence and freedom, let the spirit of the university and the spirit of the times and the spirit of the nation collide with each other, so as to provide inexhaustible impetus for the realization of national prosperity and national rejuvenation and the realization of the common ideal of mankind.

The maximum length of time that university students in Guangxi can suspend their studies to start a business is up to 5 years - Xinhua News Agency
On May 19, 2019, a special report from Xinhua News Agency Nanning (Reporter Zhang Ying) learned from the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Department of Education that in the future, all universities in Guangxi will implement a flexible academic system and relax the time limit for college students to take a leave of absence. The time limit for students to take a leave of absence for entrepreneurship can be extended by 2 to 5 years on the basis of the original academic system. The time for taking a leave of absence for entrepreneurship can be regarded as the time for practical education.
In order to promote the improvement of the entrepreneurship and innovation ability of university students, Guangxi education, human resources and other departments have worked together to build an entrepreneurship platform, build more university students' off-campus practice teaching bases, university science parks, university students' entrepreneurship parks and entrepreneurship incubation bases, and provide external support for university students' entrepreneurship.
According to the requirements, by 2020, the area of innovation and entrepreneurship practice base in each university will reach more than 3,000 square meters in undergraduate schools and more than 2,000 square meters in higher vocational schools.
The government encourages universities to set up innovation and entrepreneurship credits and give priority to supporting students who perform well in innovation and entrepreneurship practices to change their majors.
Every two years, college teachers must spend at least two months in industry enterprises for internship and training, so as to improve their awareness and ability of innovation and entrepreneurship education.
The Education Bureau of the Autonomous Region required that all universities in Guangxi carry out the innovation and entrepreneurship training plan for college students in depth, and strive to make every college student participate in an innovation and entrepreneurship training plan during their studies.
Universities should actively organize students to participate in various innovation and entrepreneurship competitions at all levels, and provide financial support.
NEWS GOV-MO: University of Macau awards honorary doctorates to seven outstanding individuals
The University of Macau held the “2021 Honorary Degree and Higher Degree Awarding Ceremony” today (11th), awarding honorary doctorates to Liu Xunyi, Chen Kaixian, Nakamura Shiuji, Li Lanjuan, Li Xiaoliang, Zhu Lili and Jiang Chaohui in recognition of their outstanding achievements and major contributions to the development of society and education.

When the NFT went out of the circle at a high speed, a new concept emerged in the encrypted community.
In 2021, a blockchain game called Axie Infinity had a huge impact in Southeast Asia, and some residents who lost their jobs due to the epidemic began to earn stable income in this game.
Axie Infinity is a blockchain-based pet-rearing game that combines a variety of gameplay, including NFT. It is currently the highest-grossing NFT project, with more than $3 billion.
According to TokenTerminal data, Axie Infinity's daily income has exceeded 8.2 million U.S. dollars, close to that of Honor of Kings.
On August 6, 2021, Axie Infinity officially announced that its daily active users had exceeded 1 million.
The popularity of "Axie Infinity" has brought a new "play-to-earn" model to more people. With the help of blockchain and smart contracts, players are no longer a single role. In addition to getting fun and economic benefits from the game, they can also participate in the governance of the game ecosystem.
This autonomy is not granted by the game maker, but is guaranteed by blockchain technology.
When I saw the news about the share price of a friend, my biggest impression was the choice of enterprises on the racecourse, that is, the choice of investment target industry. First, choose an industry with large growth space, with a market scale of at least 100 billion yuan; second, choose an industry with good growth in the future, and consider the industry with the best growth state in the next 3-5 years; third, choose an industry with policy support.
The width of the track refers to the size of the market, the length of the track refers to the development stage of the industry, and the flatness or ruggedness of the track refers to the competition pattern of the industry.
Cheering for the right track!
The first thing to do in the new year is to summarize 2021 and adjust the tactical layout for 2022.
The strategy is to "do the right things", that is, to do things right.
And the strategy is "do the right thing," which is to do the right thing.
Strategy is about finding the direction, while tactics is about implementation. There is space for strategic thinking in most tactical thinking.
For example, in addition to thinking about how to increase the number of customers (tactical thinking), we can also think about whether to continue to deepen in the current field or extend to other fields (strategic thinking); in addition to thinking about how to increase the customer retention rate (tactical thinking), we can also think about how to increase the retention rate of core customers and high-value customers (strategic thinking); in addition to thinking about how to increase the activity participation rate (tactical thinking), we can consider how to set the right activity KPIs to achieve the right activity goals, such as increasing the participation rate of target customers, activating high-value silent customers, and accurately introducing new customers; in addition to thinking about how to increase DAU (tactical thinking), we can consider whether the current growth is healthy and sustainable.
After 12 years of birth, bitcoin has experienced several milestone events in 2021.
On September 7, the small Central American country of El Salvador designated bitcoin as legal tender, making it the first time that bitcoin has become legal tender in a country or region.
On October 12, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved ProShares for the first time in eight years to launch a Bitcoin ETF and list it on the New York Stock Exchange, marking the first compliant Bitcoin futures ETF landing on the U.S. capital market and the further expansion of cryptocurrency investment opportunities.
From the perspective of the development of blockchain technology, Bitcoin is not the protagonist.
On November 14, 2021, bitcoin underwent a soft fork upgrade called Taproot, which increased the anonymity of bitcoin network transactions and reduced the data burden in transactions by changing the data structure of blocks themselves.

Asian-American groups complain of discrimination in Ivy League admissions - Xinhua News Agency
Xinhua Washington, May 23 (Reporter Xu Jianmei) More than 130 Asian-American groups in the United States submitted complaints to the U.S. Department of Education and the U.S. Department of Justice on May 23, protesting the discrimination against Asian-American applicants in the admission process of three Ivy League schools: Yale University, Brown University and Dartmouth College.
The Asian American Education Alliance, which initiated the complaint, held a press conference in Washington on the same day.
Zhao Yukun, chairman of the group, said at the press conference that in the past 10 years, the number of Asian applicants meeting the admission requirements of US top universities has doubled, but the proportion of Asians in these three US top universities has basically remained at the same level.
Numerous studies have shown that these colleges "persistently and systematically discriminate against Asian-American applicants" in the so-called "holistic" admissions process.
Zhao Yukun introduced that a 2014 study conducted by Sanders and others showed that among the three universities, Asians had the lowest acceptance rate among all ethnic groups relative to the number of applicants.
According to data from the U.S. Department of Education, among all Ivy League schools, Brown University and Dartmouth College have the lowest admission rates for Asian students, and Yale University and Brown University have implemented de facto racial quotas for Asian students for more than 20 years.
Zhao Yukun told Xinhua reporters that they hope that the U.S. Department of Education and the U.S. Department of Justice will investigate and take measures to stop these universities from continuing to discriminate against Asians in admissions after the appeal is submitted.
They also hope that the universities that have been complained about will take the initiative to pay attention to this issue and change their admissions policies for Asian students.
At present, the three universities involved in the complaints have not responded.
The Asian American Education Alliance was established in 2015, and at that time, it had filed a complaint against Harvard University's admission discrimination, but the U.S. Department of Education did not accept it for procedural reasons.
In addition to Chinese-American groups, those participating in the appeal include Indian-American, Korean-American, Japanese-American, and Pakistani-American educational groups.

In September 2020, Mr. Lu learned about a factory located in Zhangting Town, Yuyao, Zhejiang from a real estate agent. After several on-site visits, Mr. Lu decided to buy the factory.
In December of the same year, Mr. Lu discussed the details of the purchase of the factory building with Mr. Lin, a member of the family of the house owner, and transferred 200,000 yuan to the bank on the same day as a down payment.
Lin signed as the payee on the "Factory Purchase Deposit Receipt", which states, "If the buyer does not want to buy this factory, this deposit will be returned to the seller. If the seller does not want to sell this factory, the deposit will be doubled and returned to the seller. The two parties agreed to sign the factory purchase contract within a week."
However, the two sides failed to reach an agreement on the main terms of the contract, such as the scope of the sale of the factory building and the method of payment, which led to the delay in the signing of the contract for the sale of the house.
Considering that the two parties failed to reach a consensus on the contract content, several days later, Mr. Lin returned the 200,000 yuan deposit to Mr. Lu.
The house was finally chosen, the down payment has been paid, and the house money has been prepared. Only the contract needs to be signed at the door. However, the seller did not sell it, which made Mr. Lu feel helpless and angry.
To this end, Mr. Lu filed a lawsuit against Mr. Lin at the Yuyao People's Court.
After the trial, the court found that the two parties eventually failed to sign a formal contract and could not be blamed on the defendant alone. It should be reasonably presumed that the negotiation failed. Therefore, the case should not apply the penalty of down payment, and the defendant should not bear the breach of contract liability of double return of down payment.
After the first-instance judgment, the plaintiff appealed.
Recently, the second-instance court upheld the original judgment.
[Lawyers' reminder] Due care should be taken during the transaction.
When signing the contract, as a buyer, it is necessary to fulfill the necessary due diligence obligations, such as verifying the information of the owner of the house and whether the house is occupied, and specify the specific time and place of delivery in the contract to prevent disputes between the two parties when performing the contract.
(Deutsche Welle Chinese website) After the end of the "Democracy Summit" on Friday, the spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China issued a statement on Saturday (December 11) saying that the United States held the "Democracy Summit for Leaders" to "draw a line in ideology, instrumentalize and weaponize democracy, act against the reality of democracy in the name of pseudo-democracy, incite division and confrontation, and divert domestic conflicts".
The Chinese government believes that "for a long time, the United States has imposed its own political system and value concepts on others, promoted "democratic transformation", abused unilateral sanctions, and instigated "color revolutions", causing disastrous consequences.
"Democracy" has long become the "weapon of mass destruction" used by the United States to interfere in other countries' affairs.
The summit is part of Biden fulfilling his campaign promise.
The two-day meeting was held via video conference, and the leaders of 111 countries around the world were invited to attend, including the leaders of Taiwan, but China and Russia were not invited.
On the eve of the summit, China and Russia criticized the United States for the problems of its own democracy, and said that the United States was not qualified to host such a summit.
There are also questioning voices in the international community and within the United States. For example, some leaders with authoritarian tendencies were invited to the summit, such as the leaders of the Philippines, Poland and Brazil. Some people doubted that the real intention of the Biden government was to organize this summit not for democracy but for geopolitical purposes.
The newly appointed German Chancellor Scholz also participated in the video democracy summit
The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs' statement on Saturday stated that "today's American democracy is sick, and problems such as money politics, identity politics, party confrontation, political polarization, social rifts, ethnic conflicts, and the gap between the rich and the poor are becoming more and more severe", and that the democracy in the United States is a "rich man's game" established on the basis of capital.
U.S. President Biden said in his speech that "as leaders of the government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen the fence of democracy, push for reforms, achieve transparent and accountable governance, and resist the power of authoritarianism and those who want to pursue power nakedly before the public interest. "
He stressed that democracy is not something to be taken for granted, "We must renew it in every generation. In my view, this is the decisive challenge of our times. "
Biden also said that "democracy needs warriors to defend it at a time when global democracy and human rights are facing continuous and worrisome challenges".
The United States has promised to launch a one-year action after the Democracy Summit, including a $4.244 billion initiative, to strengthen democracy around the world and support independent news media.
The United States hopes that countries will make specific public commitments to improve their democratic system before the in-person Democracy Summit to be held at the end of 2022.
Biden said, "Let's all countries implement our commitments and report our progress next year."
Okay, I'm just worried that he sent it to the wrong address.

Educational thinking: How can the college entrance examination make "the top students" and "the bottom students" get what they want - Xinhua News Agency
Three students from Lanzhou Jiaotong University wrote a letter to the school leaders, expressing their confusion about the university exam, and proposed to increase the difficulty of the exam, change the type of the exam, and let the exam truly reflect the actual level of the students.
Indeed, for a long time, university entrance examinations have been a "hot topic".
On the university campus, students come from all over the country and have different abilities, not to mention the different levels of learning, and the learning situation is varied.
It is inevitable that there will be different feelings when assessing a group with such diverse characteristics.
Of course, if the exam questions are single in type, have a high repetition rate, and are too simple, it will certainly cause a completely different feeling.
The students who don't work hard may pass the exam if they study hard before the exam. If they try other methods, they may achieve twice the result with half the effort.
In this case, there is a “strange phenomenon” that the “bad students” can pass the exam even if they do not participate, and even get a high score; the “smart students” never miss a class, and their homework and notes are all good, but their exam scores are not much higher.
From this point of view, the problems reflected by the students of Lanzhou Jiaotong University in the university examination are not without reason, and it is believed that this situation does not only exist in Lanzhou Jiaotong University.
In this sense, we should applaud the three students who wrote letters.
In fact, everyone who has attended university knows that it is not uncommon for people to cram for the exam, try various methods to "extract" exam questions from the teachers, and try to obtain "key guidance" before the exam, and even carry cheat sheets during the exam and ask teachers to raise their hands after the exam.
In my opinion, as a teaching quality assessment guide, it is more important to measure whether a university examination is passed or not in terms of a teacher's comprehensive grasp of teaching and learning, and the scientific questions based on this.
Entering the university undergraduate stage, the majors begin to be subdivided, and many professional courses are mainly based on basic knowledge.
There is no doubt that whether one has fully grasped the basic knowledge points of a subject is the content to be examined in a university exam.
However, the undergraduate knowledge is basically the basic theory of the subject and basic common sense. In terms of knowledge points, there is not much room for change, and it is basically fixed.
As one teacher said, "20 years ago, I learned the basic knowledge of college mathematics, and now I am still learning and focusing on it. "
However, the knowledge points remain basically the same, which does not mean that the examination questions are single and repetitive.
In many universities, the exams are usually composed of a question-setting group, and then the senior teachers of the subject will coordinate the composition of the paper, and the marking of the exam will also be participated by all the teachers of the subject, so as to overcome the repetition of questions to a certain extent.
However, in order to come up with a set of questions that are in line with the actual teaching and learning, the difficulty of the questions should be normally distributed according to the overall situation of students' learning, and the teaching situation should be comprehensively mastered and the degree of students' learning should be comprehensively analyzed, so as to make the exam questions have a dynamic grasp of the difficulty and types. It can not only highlight the examination of basic knowledge, but also take into account the examination of ability, and at the same time, innovate the design of the types.
Examinations are the yardstick for university education. If there are such examinations, students will have corresponding preparation schemes, and in the long run, it will affect the effectiveness of university education.
The Lanzhou University attaches great importance to the students’ suggestion letters, and has deployed the rectification scheme in the whole school.
Require each teaching unit to organize teachers to conduct discussion and self-examination of the end-of-course examination, formulate examination question setting and related system, and at the same time strengthen the supervision and inspection of the examination question setting and review links, refine the evaluation of scores, and strengthen the comprehensive assessment of all aspects of course teaching.
To solve the problem of single question types and repeated questions from the mechanism is the issue that the university examination needs to face. Of course, it is necessary to introduce corresponding systems, but the key is daily efforts. Teachers need to have a comprehensive understanding of the teaching situation, not only need to understand the teaching content, but also need to understand the learning situation of students, both of which need to be understood, so that teaching and learning can be better matched, forming a positive interaction, and the exam will be more in line with the actual situation, so that the "top student" and the "bottom student" can get what they want.

Mrs. Kim's wedding photography (South Street store) has no branch for the time being
We changed the time twice because we didn't arrange the time well before the photo shoot. The consultant, Lan Lan, was very patient to help us arrange the time.
Later, I chose a sunny weekend to shoot.
Kim's staff, whether advisers, make-up artists or photographers, are all top-notch.
It was the first time in my life that I officially put on makeup, wow, I couldn't believe that one day I would become so beautiful, haha.
Xiaojie and another girl (sorry, I can't remember her name) are very patient and the makeup is very natural.
The outdoor scenes were filmed in Jiangwan City. Fortunately, the weather was good that day, and we didn't feel very cold. During the photo shoot, the make-up artists would keep an eye on our clothes, headdresses, and if something was slightly out of place, they would immediately help us to fix it.
The photographer was also very funny, and we had a great time taking photos all day long.
When we chose the photos, we didn't want to let the guests delete too many photos, but when we chose the photos, we really didn't mean to add photos. The 24 photos in the package were not added at all (I heard that my cousin, who took wedding photos at about the same time as me, added more than 10,000 photos to the package of more than 7,000 yuan. At that time, I was stunned, and I was also afraid that I would choose too many)
Today the photos were fixed, and Lan Lan sent them to me. I looked at two of them and didn’t think they were good. They immediately helped me fix them again.
When I flipped through my sister's previous photos for comparison, I felt that our photos were really satisfactory. They were simple and fresh, which was the style I wanted.
I sincerely recommend everyone to take wedding photos in Xunhan Jinfu!
Price for the set: RMB 3,999
Mrs. Kim is grateful for your sincere wishes for her happiness and success!

Sabah 3,200 newborn babies without birth certificates due to shortage of anti-counterfeiting paper
(KOTA KINABALU, Oct. 11) The Sabah National Registration Department said that due to the shortage of special anti-counterfeiting paper, they have been unable to issue birth certificates to newborn babies since the beginning of October, and a total of 3,200 people have been affected so far.
However, the director of the agency, Keru Alminous, assured that all the data of the babies who have applied for birth certificates have been recorded in the system, and will be reissued after the anti-counterfeiting paper is delivered next week.
He explained at the press conference in response to a report by an online media that the Sabah paper was printed in paper for as long as 10 months.
He said the issue surfaced two months ago and Sarawak is facing the same problem.
"One of the reasons is that the Chinese manufacturers of special anti-counterfeiting paper are affected by the epidemic, causing a delay in delivery to our country. "
He explained that the security paper used for Sabah birth certificates is different from that used in other areas, so it cannot be borrowed from other states.
Khairul Aminus revealed that the latest batch of anti-counterfeiting paper had arrived in Kuala Lumpur on the 6th of this month, and was handed over to the printing company on the 8th for partial printing work.
"The department will send people to pick up the items in Kuala Lumpur next Thursday, and return to Sabah immediately for the final phase of printing, and it is estimated that it will be delivered to the applicant within 2 working days (December 20). "
"We will notify the applicants to go to the local police station to collect the birth certificate. "
He added that Sabah has issued 24,801 birth certificates so far this year.

It's super convenient, just like opening it on a computer, and it solved my computer hard disk shortage problem.
The brand-new solid-state mobile hard drive just arrived today cannot be read by a computer with a solid-state mobile hard drive, and is not recognized by a computer with a solid-state mobile hard drive, but can be read by a computer with a U disk.
The robot is very light in hand, and the appearance is atmospheric and beautiful.
After using it for an afternoon today, the heat dissipation is very good, and it basically doesn't feel hot. The running speed is very fast, and it starts to kill 99% of the users.
The battery is also very powerful, with a standby time of 9 hours and a use time of 4 hours should not be a problem, in short, it feels very happy to buy a machine of this quality at this price, and other functions will be added later.
It looks good on the outside.
In terms of performance, it will be evaluated after a period of time.
The machine is fast, bigger than imagined, and the rendering effect is very good. I like it, and I will comment after using it for a period of time.
Not bad, not bad, the serial number of the machine can be found on Hong Kong**, and the quality should be OK.
** It doesn't feel big, but it's heavy. One hand can't hold it. It's actually not big. It's just a little bit bigger than 15.6 inches. It runs very stably and doesn't feel stuck. I love the sound of the fan's heat dissipation. It has a feeling, and it doesn't spin all the time like a gaming laptop.
The goods are not bad, much cheaper than the official flagship store, and a backpack was given, which I think is pretty good.
The service in the store was also good. They reminded me to update the BIOS, and they issued the receipt in time.
It's worth it!
Heat dissipation effect: heat dissipation is very good, basically no heat thinness: convenient to carry appearance material: Thinkpad traditional design, satisfactory
A reputable seller, carefully examined the appearance of the whole machine, all interfaces, no traces of refurbishment or use, it is indeed a new American version machine, and the configuration is the same as the page.
I forgot to send the backpack, and he immediately helped me send another backpack, although it was not the original factory backpack, but in terms of service follow-up, it was enough to prove that he is a conscientious seller.
If a friend needs to buy a laptop, buy it back.
Appearance material: The appearance is atmospheric. Display effect: The screen resolution is good, and it is clear. The degree of thinness: It is relatively textured, after all, the heavier things feel better.

48-hour nucleic acid negative, set “ buffer zone ” The State Council’s Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism issued a document to strengthen epidemic prevention and control in port cities - Xinhua News Agency
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 11 (Reporters Dong Ruifeng and Gu Tiancheng) The State Council’s Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism recently issued a notice on strengthening the prevention and control of the new crown pneumonia epidemic in port cities, requiring persons who have recently left land border port cities (except those connected with Hong Kong and Macau) to hold a negative nucleic acid test certificate within 48 hours, and persons arriving in land border port cities to conduct at least one nucleic acid test after arrival.
According to the notice, the above-mentioned requirements are within the time range from the date of determination and announcement of port cities by each province, autonomous region and municipality to March 15, 2022.
The notice also pointed out that port cities with conditions may study the establishment of epidemic prevention and control buffer zones within their jurisdiction.
The relevant person in charge of the National Health and Health Commission's Disease Prevention and Control Bureau introduced that for some port cities, cross-border trade is the main economic pillar of the local area, and the two sides have frequent exchanges.
Implement a policy of regional differentiated management, from one line of defense to prevent the spillover to two lines of defense, which is expected to achieve the shift of checkpoints, compress the risk of epidemic spillover, and achieve the maximum effect of epidemic prevention and control with the minimum social impact and the lowest social cost.
Recently, there have been a number of local cluster outbreaks in China, all of which were imported from overseas via port cities.
The above notice points out that this has exposed some problems such as the lack of timeliness of epidemic monitoring and early warning in some places, the failure to implement the closed-loop management of high-risk personnel, the form of regular nucleic acid testing, the lack of disinfection at each link of the cold chain items, the non-standard management of centralized isolation places, and the lack of scientific and accurate epidemic emergency disposal.
According to the notification, efforts should be made from 9 aspects, including improving the port city epidemic prevention and control mechanism, perfecting the epidemic monitoring and early warning system, and implementing border control measures, to speed up the replenishment of port city prevention and control short board and weak links, do prevention and control work in a scientific and precise manner, and weave and strengthen the external defense against input.
The notice emphasized that each port city should study and deploy the prevention and control of the epidemic and the livelihood guarantee work at the same time, publicize and open up the livelihood guarantee hotline, and regularly inspect the supply of basic living materials and prices, and promptly solve and actively respond to the prominent issues reflected by the masses.
According to the notice, the port cities referred to here include the counties (cities, districts, banners) where the open land, water, and air ports are located, the cities (prefectures, states, leagues) where they are located, and the municipalities where they are located. The specific scope is determined by each province (autonomous region, municipality) according to the needs of epidemic prevention and control and announced in a timely manner.

Tube video uncovers truth about 20 years of bloody killing by U.S. military - People's Daily Online
(Video Source: YouTube)
On December 11, a micro-documentary named "Killing Machine" on YouTube attracted widespread attention.
The film tells the story of the United States waging war in Afghanistan in the name of "anti-terrorism" and exporting American-style democracy by force through war. For 20 years, the United States has waged war, been bloodthirsty, killed innocent people, and committed all kinds of crimes against humanity.
They abused drones to attack hospitals, schools, and other civilian places, distorted humanity, and formed a murder group.
In the past 20 years, the U.S. military has killed tens of thousands of innocent Afghan civilians.
The U.S. military set up "black jails" to torture and humiliate the "suspects".
A series of crimes against humanity has sparked more hatred among the Afghan people.
As the video says, the U.S. "war on terror" is "the more you fight, the more you fear."
The war has not brought peace, democracy, and prosperity to the Afghan people, but only a country in ruins and countless killings and destructions.
Click on the video, and let's expose the truth of the United States' bloodthirsty killing in the name of anti-terrorism, and expose the hypocrisy of American-style democracy!
By chance, I saw the following article, which talked about why this customer wanted the logistics company in the bonded area to do the canning from a business perspective and from the perspective of shelf life, although the canning is deep processing and is not within the scope of business of the bonded logistics company. The following text may explain why the customer wanted to do this.
I went to a lot of milk powder factories and contacted a lot of milk powder production lines.
In fact, the raw materials of the bagged milk powder and the powdered milk powder are exactly the same, and there is no difference at all.
Then everyone will definitely ask: Why is the shelf life of a bag one year, while the shelf life of a bag is two years or longer?
Or ask, why is there such a big price difference between hearing aids and bags?
In fact, from this point of view, many consumers, or moms think that this is because the raw materials are different, so the quality will be much better.
In fact, the raw materials are the same, but people think that the more expensive the better.
There are also consumers who say that the taste or flavor is different when they react after eating it with this kind of mentality!
Now, I would like to tell you the reason why hearing aids are expensive. Why are they so expensive?
Why is there such a big price difference when their raw materials are the same?
Because when the manufacturer sets the price, most of them consider that if the price of the bag is too high, it is difficult for consumers to accept, which means that the profit of the manufacturer is very low, or even no profit. Then how can the manufacturer survive?
Therefore, they have a large rise in the price of hearing aids to ensure their profit space.
Therefore, most manufacturers mainly promote hearing aids, rather than bags.
There are also so many manufacturers who spend tens of millions of yuan or even hundreds of millions of yuan on advertising every year, where does this money come from?
You can imagine the rest.
So with the development of society, the promotion costs of the market, such as: the promotional staff of the store, the display cost of the store, the gift cost of the product, the advertising cost, etc. are constantly increasing.
Therefore, manufacturers are also constantly adding new products, and they are hearing aids, and their prices are also constantly rising. In fact, this is a new product that comes with the increase in market costs.
The main purpose is to obtain higher profits. In fact, the increase in the cost of their raw materials is not more than 3 or 4 yuan.
There are also some brands that, in order to promote their products, will go to any lengths to hook up with doctors in hospitals to assist in the promotion of their products, and make profits ranging from 30 yuan to 80 yuan per hearing.
However, the relevant laws in China absolutely do not allow such a way of operation. In fact, this kind of practice is cheating the consumers.
It is recommended that you buy a bag of milk powder and put it in a can at home. This can save money and increase the preservation and sealing of milk powder, which has no effect on children.
Also, don't think that the shelf life of the bag is longer than that of the bag. If the shelf life of the bag and the bag is the same after opening, it just means that the bag is not easy to save after opening and is prone to moisture and deterioration.

Don't scare people at the starting line - Xinhua News Agency
When shopping at the book fair, one can often feel the popularity of books on success.
Many of today's self-help books promote the "best principle" - that is, first assume or imply that you can "do it," and then tell you what you need to do to "do it."
That is to say, it directly jumps over the most important and fundamental link of "how to do it".
This is why all these books have one thing in common - either do it to the best of your ability or don't do it at all; either 100 or 0; either you climb Mount Tai or just stay where you are.
Such a "best principle" makes everyone admit that it is "absolutely right," but 99% of people will be frightened before the starting line.
Because this theory advocates a path of "you have to make up your mind, start over, and make a 180-degree turn", which is exactly the fatal weakness of many people.
For those who stick to the old, follow the old ways, and refuse to change, you are shouting "you have to change" in his ear, which is undoubtedly a self-deception and a move against the bull.
Most people will hesitate in front of the two words of “change”, and cannot make up their minds; or they will make the decision of “change” under the impulse of a moment, and courageously take the first step, but it is often short-lived, and it is difficult to last for a long time.
Mr. Ma Sanli's famous cross-talk "Starting from Tomorrow" is the classic that most vividly reflects this "universal human nature".
The biggest problem with the "best" principle is that the threshold is too high, and it often exceeds the limits of ordinary people's abilities, so that the vast majority of people "look at the door and sigh".
Perhaps, the "second best principle" is a way for more ordinary people to walk on the path of relative success.
The core of the "second-best principle" lies in "lowering the threshold" - it advocates the theory of "accumulating small victories for big victories", that is, if you can't do 100, you can only do 1: because 1 is always greater than 0; if you can't climb Mount Tai, you can only climb the small sand dunes at your doorstep, because it is always better than standing still.
All in all, as long as you do something, it's better than doing nothing.
With the threshold lowered significantly, it has become easier for ordinary people to stick to it, and the probability of success will increase as long as you stick to it.
However, the path to success following the "second best principle" is a little longer.
In short, the "best principle" may seem to promote success for everyone on the surface, but in reality, it can only effectively motivate a few, while the "second-best principle" can effectively motivate more people and benefit more people as much as possible.

The amount of Qinghai Lake naked carp resources increased by 0.71 thousand tons this year - Xinhua Net
Xinhua News Agency, Xining, December 11 - (Reporters Luo Xiaofei and Zhang Hongxiang) The reporter learned from the Qinghai Provincial Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs that the latest monitoring results showed that the amount of naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake has increased by 0.71 thousand tons this year, reaching 10.85 thousand tons, which is more than 40 times that of the initial protection in 2002.
The Qinghai Lake naked carp, commonly known as “Huan fish”, is a unique precious fish in Qinghai Lake. It plays a crucial role in maintaining the safety and biodiversity of the “water-fish-bird” ecological chain in the Qinghai Lake region.
In the 60s and 70s of the 20th century, the number of Qinghai Lake naked carp decreased sharply due to the influence of factors such as human large-scale hunting and the deterioration of the breeding water environment of naked carp, and the resource reserves of Qinghai Lake naked carp were only 2592 tons in 2002.
In 2004, the Qinghai Lake naked carp was listed as an endangered species in the Red List of Chinese Species.
Since 2003, Qinghai Province has implemented lake closure for fish breeding and prohibited all units, collectives and individuals from catching naked carp in Qinghai Lake and the main rivers and tributaries in the lake area, and prohibited the sale of naked carp and its products.
At the same time, through artificial propagation and stocking, as well as cleaning of the main river channels of Qinghai Lake and the design of scientifically reasonable “fish passages”, the protection efforts have been continuously increased, and the resource reserves of Qinghai Lake naked carp have increased year by year.
Yang Lin, Deputy Director-General of Qinghai Provincial Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, introduced that as of now, a total of 180 million Qinghai Lake naked carp have been artificially bred and released, and the contribution rate to the restoration of Qinghai Lake naked carp resources has exceeded 23%.
The Sanjiangyuan region of Qinghai is an important ecological barrier and water conservation area in China and Asia, and Qinghai Lake is a natural barrier and an ecological function area that controls the westward spread of desertification in the west.
In order to protect the ecological environment of the source of the three rivers and Qinghai Lake, protect aquatic wild animals, and maintain the biodiversity of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, Qinghai issued the fishing ban notices for the key waters of the Yangtze River, the Yellow River, and Qinghai Lake one after another this year, and established the "one river, one river, and one lake" comprehensive fishing ban management system.

I just saw an article about a fake case. It's too long.
To educate men who don’t know.
Most girls will suddenly experience their first period at some point between the ages of 13 and 15 and will go through menopause around the age of 50.
After that, if they are in good health, they will visit once a month on a regular basis.
But it is not regular enough to predict accurately, with a difference of about a week, it is necessary to prepare in advance, and sometimes bad luck will turn over (suddenly a few days in advance).
The length of time, the amount of blood, and the level of pain vary from person to person. Some people have it for three days, some people have it for a week. Some people have a light flow, some people have a heavy flow. Some people have no reaction, some people are in so much pain that they have to call an ambulance. Menstrual pain can change over time. Just because you didn't have any pain in the past doesn't mean you won't have any pain for the rest of your life.
Menstruation is out of control, bleeding 24 hours a day from start to finish, and the only thing you can do is use sanitary napkins or sanitary cotton to suck blood to prevent it from flowing onto clothes or chairs.
Menstrual pain is mainly due to the secretion of prostaglandin. If you take ibuprofen at the beginning of menstruation, you can effectively relieve the pain of that month. If you take it after the menstrual pain starts, it is useless.
Before menstruation, due to the congestion of the uterus and the release of too much prostaglandins, it is easy to have diarrhea.
If you are around your cycle and have a sudden case of diarrhea, you will probably get your period within two days.
It is best to change sanitary napkins every two or three hours, otherwise it is easy to breed bacteria. Excluding sleeping time, the worst case is to change them six times a day, seven days a month, that is, 42 pieces. If you add the prepared pieces, there may be 50 pieces, which is not one per month.
(Here we make a change. Sanitary napkins do not need to be changed frequently. They can be changed once every five or six hours. The maximum time is eight hours.)
The menstrual period may be more irritable due to the influence of hormones, and the ovulation period may be emotionally unstable due to the change of hormones in the body, which is very unlucky, and the body makes trouble for itself.
However, the official crime rate data shows that women's ability to control their emotions is still very high, and they will not use emotional issues as an excuse.
The flow is not just blood, but includes the sloughing off of the uterine lining.
After the end of menstruation, the endometrium of the uterus is the thinnest, and then it gradually thickens, which can be understood as the uterus is a house, and a house is built every month (the endometrium thickens) to welcome guests. If the guests do not come, all of them will be demolished (menstruation) and a new house will be built next month, and so on.
Menstruation is very inconvenient. For several decades, a few days a month, 24-hour bleeding, and abdominal pain and lower back pain, who would like it?
However, people can be born because his mother has a period, the period is to prepare a 10-month house for you to come to this world for the first time. Everyone should thank their mother for having a regular and healthy period.
A lot of things about women were suppressed before, and society brainwashed women that it was dirty and shameful, and people thought it was just like that, but the times have changed.
If someone thinks that menstruation is disgusting or thinks that the preparation of the female body for the birth of life is disgusting, they should not say it in public. Girls should stand up and stop thinking this way. Men who have never experienced it, will never experience it in their lives, and do not know much about it should not be so ungrateful and ignorant. How can they have the courage to face their mothers? How can they have the courage to want their own children?
Finally, sisters try sanitary napkins, which are really useful.

Is it an electric leak when your feet are numb in the foot bath?
Choosing a suitable foot bath can play a good role in foot massage and health care. Today, the editor of Guomei will answer this question. I hope it will be helpful to friends.
As people's health awareness increases, foot bath tubs are becoming more and more popular with consumers. A large number of products of different grades have emerged in the market, from hundreds of yuan to thousands of yuan, giving consumers a wide range of choices.
On the surface of the relevant data, compared with traditional home appliances, the sales of health care home appliances such as foot bath tubs are hot, but foot bath tubs do not have specific industry standards, so there are some safety hazards.
"It's too dangerous to put your feet in the water when it's electrified!"
Mr. Li told the reporter that he recently bought a foot bath for his father as a birthday gift, but his father felt his feet numb when he soaked his feet.
At first, Mr. Li thought it was caused by the vibration function of the foot bath, but he didn't expect that after turning off the vibration function, his father still felt numb on the soles of his feet.
When Mr. Li tried it with an electric pen, the electric pen actually lit up, and Mr. Li was surprised to find that the water in the foot bath was electrified.
Later, he contacted the merchant, and the attitude of the merchant was not bad, although the foot bath was returned. Mr. Li was still unhappy.
Because he found that the foot bath that has been popular for a long time has no clear and detailed industry standards in terms of the highest temperature setting, who it is suitable for, and what materials ensure that it is harmless.
However, in general, footbaths will not have the problem of electricity, but it is not ruled out that some products have not been strictly inspected when leaving the factory.
Therefore, when buying, choose a separate foot bath tub.
Water and electricity are separated, and there is no safety hazard.
At the same time, you can measure at will with an electric pen.
The 13th Provincial Tea Fair was opened - see the headlines - Hunan Daily Net - Huasheng Online
Hunan Daily News on December 10 (full-media reporter Zhang Shangwu, Hu Panpan, correspondent Liu Xiaoling, photographer Li Jian) Today in the morning, the 13th Hunan Tea Expo and Xinhua Red Tea Promotion was held at the Hunan International Convention and Exhibition Center, showcasing the tea industry, innovating tea technology, promoting tea culture, and accelerating the sprint to the 100 billion tea industry goal.
The opening ceremony was attended by Hu Shunli, Deputy Chairman of the Board of Directors of the China National Supply and Marketing Cooperative, and Ye Hong, Deputy Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Provincial People's Congress.
Prof. Liu Zhonghua, a member of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, made a grand recommendation at the opening ceremony: The source of Lake Hong is new and the rise of red tea will inject new impetus into the "Colorful Xiang Tea".
In recent years, the Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial Government have strongly supported the development of the tea industry, promoted the construction of the 100 billion yuan Hunan tea industry, and formed the development pattern of “Three Xiang, Four Waters and Five Colors Tea”.
The tea industry in the province has increased its innovation. Green tea, black tea and red tea and other main tea varieties have been launched one after another, and the main tea-producing areas have promoted the integration of tea and travel, which has driven a large number of tea farmers to increase their income.
Feng shui is constantly changing, and red tea is making a comeback.
Experts in the tea industry in the province said that after harvesting the green tea, harvesting the red tea and black tea, tea farmers have an income in every season of the year, and the value of the tea garden has increased in a straight line.
At the opening ceremony, provincial leaders awarded the fourth batch of enterprises with the right to use the “Hunan Red Tea” trademark, and Xinhua held up the “Hunan Red Tea Source”.
At the New Hu Red Tea Museum, Fujian tea merchants were attracted by a high mountain tea named "Ice Spring" and immediately placed an order.
Wang Jun, the Secretary-General of the Provincial Tea Industry Association, said happily that the current epidemic and other factors have more or less affected the tea market, but from the scene of the tea fair, there are many highlights.
The new-style red tea has a touch of red and injected the connotation of tea culture. The popularity is high and the transaction is hot. The Xiang tea industry welcomes a new spring.
What if the food is not hot, can it be cancelled?

Metaphysics is the study of problems that cannot be answered directly by perception through rational reasoning and logic.
Metaphysics is the fundamental law of philosophy, which seeks to explain the fundamental nature of existence and the world.
The Chinese translation of “metaphysics” was taken from the phrase “形而上者谓之道，形而下者谓之器” in 《易经•系辞上传》, which was translated by Japanese Inoue Tetsuzō (in the Meiji period) from metaphysic.
The branches of metaphysics include ontology, natural theology and its related issues.
Ontology is "the study of which nouns represent real existing things, and which nouns just represent a concept."
Metaphysical naturalism is the denial of the existence of God.
Its theoretical basis holds that all phenomena can be explained by the concept of natural reason, proposed by philosophers who support science and evolution theory.
Methodological naturalism refers to a method of study that makes no mention of God.
The philosophy of mind is a branch of philosophy that studies the nature of consciousness and its relationship to the body (especially the brain).
Dualism and monism are the two main schools of thought that discuss the relationship between mind and body.
Epistemology is a branch of philosophy that investigates the nature, origin, and scope of knowledge.
Ethics is the systematic study and inquiry into human moral life; here, morality is defined as all the standards of behavior recognized by a group of people or a culture.
It is mainly divided into metaethics (which studies the essence of ethical theory or criticism in an abstract way), and normative ethics (which judges various different moral views, and gives moral guidelines for right or wrong behaviors.
It studies what style of ethical behavior people should follow), applied ethics (the academic study of applying ethical theories to real-life situations, including bioethics, political ethics, etc.), descriptive ethics (collecting information about how people live, generalizing from observed styles).
It does not proceed from a preconceived theory of ethics, but investigates the real choices made, and observed, by actual moral agents, and all the moral factors that went into making those choices, and it studies the ethical views held by social groups.
The history of ethics includes Greek and Roman ethics, and medieval Christian ethics.
The first part is the ethical thought of humanism, represented by Valla and Montaigne.
The second part is the ethical thought of religious reform, represented by Calvin.
The third part: Political ethics, represented by Machiavelli and others, modern ethics (17-18th century, British empirical ethics, representative figures: Hume and others, 17-18th century, European rationalist ethics, representative figures: Spinoza and others, 18th century, French enlightenment ethics, representative figures: Voltaire and others, 18-19th century, German academy ethics, representative figures: Kant and Hegel and others, 18-19th century, British utilitarian ethics, representative figures: Bentham and Sidgwick and others, 19th century, British evolutionist ethics, representative figures: Spencer and Huxley and others, late 19th century, German neo-Kantian ethics, representative figures: Liebknecht and others, late 19th century, neo-Hegelian ethics, representative figures: Thomas Hill Green and others), transitional ethics (irrationalist ethics, representative figures: Kierkegaard, Schopenhauer and Nietzsche and others).
Logic is the study of "the principles and standards of valid inference and proof".
Logic typically consists of three parts: inductive reasoning, abductive reasoning and deductive reasoning, which can be divided into formal logic and informal logic.
Aesthetics is a discipline whose subject is the nature and meaning of beauty.

Ding Zilin: To a friend.
I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to all friends for their humanitarian assistance during the long 30-year period after the death of our loved ones, especially the assistance that has not been interrupted since I made a personal appeal to friends at home and abroad for humanitarian assistance in early 1994.
Now, most of the parents of the victims have already passed away, and the orphans have grown up and have jobs.
It was your generosity that helped us, the bereaved families, get through the most difficult moments.
At present, the new crown epidemic is raging in the world, and most of the donors are already retired.
Therefore, I earnestly request you to stop the humanitarian donations to us, the Tiananmen Mothers group, which should have ended perfectly a long time ago.
I will always remember your kindness and believe that your good deeds will be remembered by history.
Due to various reasons, I can only express my wishes in this way, please understand!
Please accept my sincere blessings.
Tao Ye said: Please allow me to take this opportunity to make a brief introduction to the 32-year history of the International Federation of Chinese Students and Scholars (IFCSS) and the Minnesota China Democracy Foundation (MCDF) engaged in humanitarian assistance.
In the process of humanitarian assistance, the American Association of Universities and the Minnesota China Democracy Foundation are two parallel organizations, and the project implementers often overlap.

Relief funds often fail to reach the hands of the June 4 victims.
In 1994, at the suggestion of Mr. Ding, the “Tiananmen Mother” established a special group to coordinate and take charge of the receipt and distribution of relief funds.
In 1998, MCDF established the June 4th Orphans Education Fund, and 11 years later, in 2009, after all the June 4th orphans had graduated from university, MCDF established the June 4th Orphans and Poor Elderly Special Assistance Fund, which has been implemented to this day.
The funding for these projects came from campus and community donations in 1989, generous individual contributions, and support from the university's Democracy Foundation.
Since 2018, it has also been supported by the Foundation for Criminal Justice Research.
It was not until last year, 31 years later, that the June 4 victims finally received a portion of the donations raised in the name of June 4 that year from Hong Kong.
During this time, Chinese Human Rights also independently implemented its humanitarian assistance projects.
We understand that Mr. Ding stopped the June 4 donation for the sake of the donors, and we are indeed some retired old people. Our income is not as abundant as it was before retirement, so we would like to express our gratitude to Mr. Ding’s “letter to friends”.
We will respect the decision of the refugees and terminate the project within two years and resume it immediately if needed.
At the same time, I would like to express my gratitude and respect to those courageous fellow travelers who have always been willing to donate and risk their lives to deliver humanitarian assistance over the years.

Members' comments
[Effect] Photo effect: I took two sets of clothes. Overall, it's not bad. I like this set of pictures very much.
[Service] Service details: Because of pregnancy, I was a little uncomfortable during makeup. The makeup artist and the staff were very considerate. They let me rest for a while on the side. They also kept pouring me hot water to drink.
Package price: RMB 1,000
Thanks for the comments from the rabbit. I originally said that the ancient style is not suitable for the ancient style, but I didn’t expect the finished product to be so beautiful.
Thank you, Dandan, for your recognition. Your satisfaction can make us full of power to move forward. We will continue to work hard!
This photo studio is really great, and I highly recommend it to all of you!
From the reception, makeup, costumes, lighting, photography to post-production, everything was impeccable.
The makeup artist is very delicate and will match the makeup suitable for you according to your style, and the makeup products used are all first-line big brands.
Professor Tian Liang doesn't need to be mentioned. His photography is quite professional.
The whole studio has an artistic atmosphere, and there are two little cats to play with.
We work in Beijing, and good studios in Beijing need to be lined up six months in advance. Some of my colleagues have shot in Beijing, and after watching the whole film, I think it's just so-so.
I found this studio on purpose, a place with soul and attitude.
Our facial expressions are not well managed, and I feel that this is also a shortcoming of most people. The photographer, Brother Liang, will capture and record the natural and wonderful moments.
Makeup artists, photographers, post-design, a well-rounded team.
When it came out, we and the people around us all praised it.
I had already recommended it to a friend, and she was also very happy after watching the film.
I hope that such a studio will not be buried, and that more people will discover it, and shoot in their own style, instead of following the crowd.
Many thanks to the five-star reviews of Zhan Ying and Jing Ling. Both of them are very thoughtful and creative newcomers. We are a creative studio. As long as the customer likes us, we will do our best to complete it. Thank you for meeting
The sweet and considerate assistant, and the lively and cheerful photographer teacher, everyone in the team is so nice. It was a wonderful shooting. It was a very memorable experience, and the effect of the shooting was much better than I expected. Thank you all for your hard work. I'm very grateful to you.
Thank you for your comments. It is also a kind of fate to know you. From Hohhot to Qinhuangdao, our trust is thousands of kilometers. I am very happy to know you. If there is an opportunity, I will come to Qinhuangdao again.
How do I pay?
The redelivered meal has arrived
No riders to receive
Now the restaurant is calling me
A little programmer who wants to share his personal experience.
If you plan to enter this industry, you can choose to go to a place for training, but if you don't have this idea, it is better to learn by yourself. After all, the cost of training is very high, and you have to spend 6 months to learn.
But if you are planning to enter this industry, training is indeed a very good choice, especially for those people who are very weak in self-discipline. Training is a very good choice.
If you have strong self-control, you can choose self-study, but it will be more tiring.
Of course, it is very important to choose a good training institution.
First of all, we should look at the teaching staff of this institution. If the teaching staff is not strong enough, the training institution will be meaningless. Of course, the teaching staff of some newly opened training institutions is not particularly strong.
Secondly, it is necessary to inquire about the training institution before making a choice. It is best to inquire about the students who have graduated from the institution. After all, only the students of the institution know whether the institution is good or bad, and whether the courses are good or bad.
Hello, in fact, I don't know how to answer your question, because there is no specific introduction to your own situation. Learning this thing has a lot to do with your own situation.
For example, your profession, age, the language you want to learn, and even the city you live in are all related to the industry you are studying or want to work in.
If you are a student and haven't graduated yet, or if you have graduated from a computer science major, I personally recommend self-study if you have enough time, which is the most efficient and cost-effective. Now many offline and online training institutions are actually very good, but the cost of learning is high, and the time invested is relatively long, basically requiring 3-6 months of intensive training.
But if it's what I said, it's very convenient to self-study. There are a lot of free learning resources on the Internet now, or you can get a lot of training resources on B station. If you don't know how to find resources, you can also contact me through the introduction to get free resources or detailed consultation.
There are also some classic books that can be studied in combination with videos.
If you are not a computer professional, but you can also pay a certain amount of learning money and time cost, it is recommended that you go to the training institution to learn, so that you do not have to learn hard, and the teacher's explanation is also very detailed. If you have any questions, there are people who are dedicated to answering them. In addition, in terms of learning planning or supervision, it is also helpful.
Moreover, many training institutions will sign employment agreements now, and there will be internal recommendation positions. After learning, they will recommend going to the company. In this way, the interview process when looking for a job later can also save a lot of things.
These are some of my views. I didn't introduce them in detail because I don't know your situation. If you have other questions, you can contact me at any time.
I said before 1 o'clock, I saw it on the App

Give me a chance, and I will definitely make you satisfied. Quality speaks for itself, because professionalism is worth being trusted. Your recognition is my greatest encouragement!
It's not easy to do anything these days!
But I always believe that as long as I'm serious, persistent, and hard-working, I will do better than others, at least it's better than sitting there and complaining!"
A day is planned in the morning. All the good things start from the early morning. I wish you to start a new day with happiness, luck, health, and satisfaction and keep a good mood all day long. Good morning.
When we were young, happiness was a thing, and we were happy when we had it; When we grew up, happiness was a goal, and we were happy when we reached it; When we became mature, we realized that happiness was a state of mind, and we were happy when we understood it.
Be the most real and kindest self, act according to one's heart, and have no regrets in this life. There is only one path in life, follow one's own path; there are two treasures in life: a good body and a good mood, and be bright and bright to live to old age!
Each stage of life will face different difficulties.
Many times, it's not a lack of ability that holds you back, but a lack of courage to face it positively.
Since it cannot be avoided, it is better to face it frankly.
The more you fear, the more you will be knocked down by the difficulties. If you face the difficulties, the problem will be solved.
Chinese and Saudi curators join hands to hold Saudi Arabia's first contemporary art biennial - Xinhua News Agency
Xinhua News Agency, Riyadh, December 12 (Reporters Wang Haizhou and Hu Guan) The First Biennial of Contemporary Art in Saudi Arabia, the Diriyah Biennial of Contemporary Art, was officially opened to the public on December 11 in the Diriyah JAX art district in the northwest of Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia. A total of 64 artists from Saudi Arabia, China, and other places participated in the exhibition.
This biennale was co-organized by the Saudi Diriyah Biennial Foundation and the Chinese UCCA Ullens Center for Contemporary Art, and the director of the Chinese UCCA Ullens Center for Contemporary Art, Tian Feiyue, served as artistic director.
According to the exhibition team, the theme of this biennial is "Crossing the River by Touching the Stone", which is a metaphor for the reform strategy adopted during the period of social and economic transformation, and also reflects the current situation of the social and cultural development of Saudi Arabia.
This biennial covers an area of nearly 12,000 square meters, and the exhibition hall spans six interconnected buildings, presented in six units: "Crossing the River by Feeling the Stones", "Heritage as Experiment", "Marginal Thinking", "Toward the Public", "Beautiful New World", and "On the Spirit of Art".
Among them, the works of 27 Saudi artists account for more than 40% of the total number of works in this exhibition, covering a variety of forms such as painting, installation art and performance art; the works of 12 Chinese artists are also very popular. Some artists use recycled materials in a novel way to create. For example, Xu Bing uses waste to reconstruct a classic landscape painting in the "Behind the Story Series: Xishan Endless Picture" (2014).
Barkley, the CEO of the Diriyah Biennale Foundation, said that he hoped that this biennial would establish an international dialogue and give the global audience the opportunity to learn about Saudi Arabia's thriving cultural industry and creative community, and increase interaction.
Tian Feiyue said, "The goal of the biennale is two-fold. On the one hand, it will enable Saudi contemporary art to participate in global dialogue. On the other hand, it will allow Saudi audiences to integrate into the contemporary art world. "
According to reports, a series of lectures will be held during the opening week of the biennial. Artists, curators and opinion leaders in the creative industry will discuss topics such as cross-cultural exchange and the development of contemporary art.

Yunnan: coordinated management of rural public welfare posts - Xinhua News Agency
Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, December 12th (Reporter Lin Bifeng) In order to continue to do a good job in the employment support of the poor population and consolidate and expand the achievements of poverty alleviation, Yunnan Province recently issued relevant policies to promote the management of rural public welfare posts to promote rural revitalization, and help the overall promotion of rural revitalization.
An official from Yunnan Provincial Human Resources and Social Security Bureau introduced that at present, a total of 448,300 rural public welfare posts have been developed in Yunnan, which are used to settle the employment of poverty-stricken laborers and other rural difficulties groups, and play an important role in helping the poverty-stricken people to realize employment and income growth, consolidating the achievements of poverty alleviation, and effectively improving the various public services in rural areas.
This new regulation was jointly issued by seven departments including Yunnan Human Resources and Social Security, Rural Revitalization, and Finance, which mainly unified the scope of objects, financial management, post development, post management and other aspects for the recruitment of rural public welfare posts at the grassroots level.
In terms of post development setting, the new regulation clarifies that it should be set up according to the principles of "setting posts according to needs, setting people according to posts, dynamic management, control of total amount", "who develops, who uses, who is responsible", and "one person, one post, voluntary publicity, and unified management".
The recruitment procedure must follow the steps of announcement, application, examination, announcement, employment, pre-employment training and arrangement for on-the-job training.
In addition, the new regulation also clarified the specific responsibilities of the main development departments of rural public welfare posts, the subsidy standards and subsidy methods of rural public welfare posts, and stipulated that each rural public welfare post development department should purchase accidental injury commercial insurance for the rural public welfare post placement personnel; and required the relevant departments to regularly supervise the distribution of rural public welfare post subsidies.

Hi
Can I cancel the order?
I re-ordered
Whether it has been canceled
Second, although the right wing has a period of success in history, it is not long. Therefore, it is short because it is brilliant with a little sunshine and sweaty with a little water. If it is a little successful, it will look forward to Shu; if it is hit, it will be attached to it.
However, in reality, the right has played a positive role in the process of social progress.
From the end of the Cultural Revolution to define the standard of truth, the development of the economy and the improvement of science and technology, and the promotion of political institutionalization and human rights protection, the positive significance of the right wing should not be denied.
Thirdly, as for me, although I do not entirely agree with some of what Li Weidong says, I care a lot about what he says, and I have a lot of respect for Li Weidong; because he is serious, he is serious about China, and he takes China's social problems seriously.
However, I disagree with his anti-communist theory. I think that an anti-revolution is necessary, and that a revolution will inevitably lead to social unrest, loss of livelihoods, a muddle of political groups, and finally, a foreign invasion.
Fourth, to change or improve China, we must have patience and be responsible to the country and the people. Those who take advantage of political speculation are not right-wingers, but assholes.
Let's talk about the left again.
The left, in fact, is a group of outcasts of the times and politics.
If the right has a positive meaning for society, the Communist Party will listen to some of the right’s words and analyze their ideas when needed, then the left doesn’t have this good fortune, because what the left wants is the dregs that the Communist Party has thrown away!
Fifthly, I have recently seen some friends arguing with anti-communists and refuting the left at the same time, which is quite powerful. I think there is no need to do so.
Don't try to reason with a traitor or a left-winger. They are all one-track minds, and there is no reason to reason with them.
Also, don't try to prove that we're right, and don't even think about getting the counter-revolutionaries and left-wingers to admit it, why bother?
I told my friends that when the anti-party curses you as a five-cent person and when the left-wing curses you as a right-wing dog, it just proves that our middle path is right!
Many people had ideals when they were young, but they forgot the ideals after they grew up, or pursued the ideals, but became obsessed.
and the ideal is getting farther and farther away, and even the young man who slaughters dragons has become an evil dragon.
I think left and right generally refers to restraint and freedom, and China as a whole should be biased to the left due to its historical cultural innate genes.
Domestic right-wing freedoms focus on efficiency and development, while the left-wing strengthens supervision and focuses more on fairness and security.
Now society as a whole hopes to pay more attention to fairness. At the same time, China and the United States are in conflict, and the left is positive. It is estimated that it will continue for many years.
Although I don't understand it, it is enough to give a thumbs-up.
Nothing to say, Hua Hua is so chivalrous
In the past two years, the US blockade and encirclement of Huawei's chips have not only put Huawei in an unprecedented predicament, but also caused huge losses to "American-style" enterprises.
The United States suppressed China’s chip industry and required its own enterprises and relevant enterprises in its allies to impose a blockade on China’s chip industry at the same time, which directly led to the fact that the orders and profits of global chip suppliers were affected, the R&D investment and production capacity of chip production enterprises decreased, and the global chip supply chain was disordered due to the shortage.
Nowadays, the "chip shortage" has affected major industries around the world. For example, car manufacturers have suspended production and mobile phone prices have risen. Almost all industries that use chips have been affected.
In order to grasp the "chip" autonomy, more and more technology giants in more and more countries have begun to move towards the "de-Americanization" path.
In order to firmly control the global semiconductor control rights and curb the development of the Chinese semiconductor industry, the United States has recently taken frequent actions. First, it hosted a "chip summit"; then, it invited 64 national giants to establish a semiconductor alliance and provided funding to support U.S. domestic technology giants. For example, the old-fashioned U.S. technology giant Intel spent 20 billion U.S. dollars to build two wafer processing plants in Arizona, U.S., in order to regain its dominant position in the chip field, and opened the chip outsourcing business to the outside world.
When most people thought that Intel's move would have a certain impact on TSMC, and it was very likely to take away TSMC's "rice bowl".
The reason why we are so confident is that Intel, as a long-established technology giant in the United States, has been deeply engaged in the field of semiconductors for decades, and has a large number of human resources and technical reserves. It must be able to rise rapidly in a short period of time and defeat TSMC.
However, TSMC's founder, Zhang Zhongmou, did not care about Intel's decision.
At the “2021 Master Think Tank Forum” held in April this year, Zhang Zhonghua’s words were surprising. For Intel’s investment in the construction of wafer factories, Zhang Zhonghua did not hesitate to say: It is quite ironic for Intel to build a chip foundry.
The reason why Zhang Zhongmou is disdainful of Intel’s entry into the wafer field is that Zhang Zhongmou still has a grudge against the relationship between TSMC and Intel more than 30 years ago.
In the 1960s and 1970s, Intel was the pearl of American manufacturing industry. It was at the top of the world and was the overlord of the global semiconductor industry.
By the 1980s, the world's high-end chips were in the hands of a few giants.
At that time, the semiconductor industry was characterized by the IDM model, and chips were designed, manufactured, and tested by a single factory. Intel was the representative of that era.
However, such a model has overwhelmed some small enterprises, and many semiconductor entrepreneurs have to give up in the face of the huge cost of production line construction.
Under the market demand, after entering the 1980s, the chip industry began to show the phenomenon of division of labor and cooperation. In 1984, when Zhang Zhonghua heard that there was a company specializing in chip design, he thought that since there was a company specializing in design, he could set up a company specializing in wafer manufacturing.
Not long after, Zhang Zhonghua’s vision became a reality, and TSMC came into being.
TSMC focuses on “wafer fabrication” in its core business. It does not engage in design, but only provides foundry services for wafer manufacturing.
At that time, TSMC, which had just been established, was just a little guy in front of the giant Intel.
In order to obtain capital support, Zhang Zhonghua had sought investment from Intel. However, when Intel heard that TSMC was only engaged in the manufacturing link of the chip industry, it obviously had a high self-esteem, looked down on TSMC, and resolutely refused to invest in TSMC.
Zhang Zhongmou also believed that Intel was disdainful of the wafer process service at that time.
I didn’t expect that the giant of wafer manufacturing services, which used to look down on wafer manufacturing services, now also has to start doing wafer manufacturing services.
Therefore, Zhang Zhongmou feels that it is ironic for Intel to enter the foundry business.
Today, TSMC’s market value has already exceeded that of Intel.
In the face of TSMC's powerful attack, Intel is naturally not willing to stand still.
Today, TSMC has already rushed to 3nm chips, while Intel is still stuck at 14nm, seven years ago.
It's not easy to catch up.
Can't wait
It has been 2 hours since I placed the order at 7:06 p.m.
Today, let's take a look at some [strange hot searches].
What is normal public opinion?
Randomly select three hot searches: February 2nd Dragon’s Head, Good Friends Price Increase, and Huolala Incident. The public opinion expands to form a wave peak, and then the [index decreases] (smooth curve) and finally dissipates. If there is a secondary public opinion, there will be a small wave peak again.
They look no different from the [network public opinion evolution model] displayed on the official website of the Cyberspace Administration of China.
What is abnormal public opinion?
Randomly selected six hot searches from the same event, presenting a "lone peak", "sawtooth", and "cliff".
The "isolated peak" means that people heat up and quickly rush to the top of the hot search list to attract public attention; the "sawtooth" means periodic heating to ensure that the topic stays on the hot search list; the "cliff" means collective evacuation. The hot search has played its "function" and received a new task and rushed to a new battlefield.
In Figure 9, the heat wave peak of one event is exactly the trough of another event, and the time is accurate to the second. It must be that the unified water army has received the task and launched a new round of attacks.
The professionalization of black public relations can be seen: dozens of hot searches are on the list at the same time, which ones attract attention, which ones are responsible for science popularization, which ones stir up momentum, which ones shift the focus, which ones affect cognition, which ones mislead judgment, which ones incite emotions, which ones drag decision-making, and black products accounts are divided into batches and nodes for fine-grained combat, almost taking into account all the elements involved in the dissemination of public opinion.
Public relations is a science, and black PR will be nowhere to hide if we only look at objective data, regardless of position, emotion, and all other subjective factors.
Everyone who passes by will leave traces, and we will dig out these traces together.

Mauritius and other countries have discovered the Omicron strain for the first time - Xinhua News Agency
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 12 - According to reports from Xinhua News Agency's foreign reporters, Mauritius, Cyprus and Malawi recently reported the first cases of infection with the omicron variant of the new coronavirus.
Mauritius reported the first two cases of the Omicron variant in the country on the 10th.
According to Mauritius Health Minister Kailesh Jagutpal, one of the infected persons was a tourist who arrived in Mauritius on 27 November from South Africa; the other was a local resident of Mauritius who tested positive for nucleic acid on 30 November after coming into contact with a person who had recently returned from South Africa.
After hospital isolation treatment, the nucleic acid test results of the two infected persons turned negative, and they have now returned to their respective places of residence.
The Cyprus Ministry of Health announced on the 10th that it had confirmed the country's first three cases of infection with the Omicron variant.
The three of them are students who returned from abroad at the beginning of this month. They were all mild cases and did not go to the hospital for treatment.
In order to prevent the spread of the Omicron variant, the government of Cyprus is constantly increasing its prevention and control efforts.
From December 6 to January 10, 2023, passengers over the age of 12 arriving by plane will need to pay for a nucleic acid test at the airport upon arrival.
On the 10th, the Ministry of Health in Serbia also announced that it would start vaccinating children aged 5 to 11 in the country with the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine.
Malawi's Minister of Health, Khumbize Chiponda, said on the 9th that the country discovered three cases of the Omicron variant for the first time.
The country’s health department found the three cases of infection after sequencing the genomes of 12 positive COVID-19 samples collected from November 9 to December 2.

Got a belly full of money
The order is the claw.
Okay, the phone number is #PHONENUMBER#
Do I need to stay in the conversation?
I called your staff #NAME# and explained to them
Your riders told me the address was too far
Da Mei 360 integrated home decoration
Address: No. 156, South Ring Road, 12th floor, Happy Home
It was a friend who introduced me at the beginning. Because of the trust, I chose to take a look. My initial budget was 70,000 for a basic renovation.
As soon as they entered the store, they started a series of tricks.
It was the first time I went to the store just to show them my floor plan. They didn't go to the site to measure the house. They could actually give me a quote saying that my 135-square-meter house can be done for 70,000 yuan. They also showed me their materials, but I didn't know what brand of materials they were.
Their second trick is to drag you into the store once you're there and get you to pay the deposit (and once you've paid, you can't get it back, unless you have enough experience to argue with them).
When I was hesitating whether to pay the deposit, they would invite their so-called manager to tell you that as long as you pay the deposit today, we can give you a lot of discounts.
This is a big pit, and I am a living example of being cheated. I paid a deposit of more than ten thousand yuan when I was in a hurry.
The quote he gave me had a lot of questions, 70,000 didn't include water and electricity renovation, and didn't include any doors and cabinets and bathroom, and these three are the main costs of the base.
They also charge more for their service points than other companies.
I lost trust in this company, and they asked me to sign a contract without explaining anything to me in the beginning.
When I went to ask for my money back, they were very experienced, with a dedicated team to deal with you.
In any case, it's the customer's problem and they're entirely blameless.
Various excuses, there are many details, I don't want to say one by one, in short, don't choose them, because the quality of the house renovated by my friends is not good, and they will charge you all kinds of fees in the later stage.
Damn it, they are the original deceptive dragon head decoration, now changed to big beauty, it seems to have closed again and changed to other things.
So don't choose such a shitty decoration company.
In the future, when you choose, you should do a Baidu search and check these consultations, because renovation is not a small amount of money.
To ask a question of a merchant, please log in or register
It is strictly prohibited to publish any form of business reviews. For details, please refer to the business inclusion declaration.
The Kunming decoration design channel of Dianping provides you with the latest merchant information, such as the address, telephone and business hours of Da Mei 360 integrated home decoration. If you want to find a decoration company, just go to Dianping.
If it is not delivered within 30 minutes, please cancel the order!
Is there no other way? For example, change the address?
Okay, then don't cancel this conversation. If I don't get my money back in 5 to 10 days, I'll definitely hold you accountable.
I asked if it could be cancelled in less than 15 minutes.
The chicken should be cooked, but what I received was raw, so I couldn't eat it.
Starry Sky around丨The Gemini meteor shower will reach its peak on the 14th - Xinhua News Agency
China News Service, Tianjin, December 12 (Reporter Zhou Runjian) The astronomical and popular science expert introduced that as the last large-scale meteor shower of the year, the Gemini meteor shower, one of the three major meteor showers in the northern hemisphere, will reach its peak on December 14. Friends who like meteor showers can observe in the latter half of the night on that day.
The Geminid meteor shower in the constellation Gemini, photographed by Beijing astronomy enthusiast Anjiu on December 13, 2018 in Qinghai.
Most meteor showers are produced by periodic comets, but the Geminid meteor shower is produced by 3200 Phaethon, an Apollo-type asteroid.
The Geminid meteor shower is also the second known meteor shower not to be "birthed" by a comet.
Tianjin Astronomical Society director and astronomy popularization expert Xu Lijun said that just like the Lunar New Year film, the Gemini meteor shower generally appears at the end of the year, and the "screening period" can last from December 4th to 17th.
The meteor shower is known for its large and stable flow, and is one of the three largest meteor showers in the Northern Hemisphere, together with the Quadrantid meteor shower and the Lyrid meteor shower.
One of the notable characteristics of the Gemini meteor shower is that the speed of the meteor is relatively slow, the color is rich, and there are many fireballs. It is suitable for both naked-eye observation and photography for beginners.
The Geminid meteor shower captured by Yang Jing, an astronomy enthusiast in Tianjin on December 13, 2020 in Jiuzhou, Tianjin.
The astronomical forecast shows that this year's Gemini meteor shower will reach its maximum at around 3:00 p.m. on December 14, and the maximum ZHR (the number of meteors that can be seen per hour when the radiant point is directly above the head under ideal observation conditions) will be 150.
The Gemini meteor shower recommendation chart.
"Last year, the Geminids meteor shower left a deep impression on people, but this year's Geminids meteor shower will be interfered with by the moonlight, and its splendor will be slightly discounted.
On the 14th, it was the 11th day of the 11th month of the lunar calendar, and the phase of the moon was waxing and waning. The bright moonlight would interfere with the observation. Fortunately, the moon will set in the latter half of the night. At this time, the radiant point of the Gemini meteor shower will also rise higher.
Friends who like meteor showers can observe in the few hours after midnight when the moon has set, but should pay attention to keeping warm. "
How can you see as many meteors as possible?
"It is not recommended to observe in the city, you can choose a place with high altitude, less light pollution, facing the northeast direction, and open view in the suburbs or countryside, and then wait patiently for the moon to set, and you can observe it with the naked eye.
It should be noted that the flow of the Gemini meteor shower is large in all directions, and it is not necessary to keep looking at the Gemini meteor shower's radiation point during observation.
If you like photography and want to take pictures of the "meteor shower", it is best to choose a wide-angle lens with a large aperture, and use high ISO and maximum aperture when shooting.
A tripod, spare batteries and a cable release are also essential, based on considerations of stability and sustainability. "
Xiuli Peng reminded.
What is the difference between laser TV and traditional TV in terms of market positioning?
According to my understanding, the traditional TV referred to by the questioner should refer to the LCD TV, and the difference between the laser TV and the LCD TV in market positioning mainly has the following two points:
First, laser TVs are more focused on the big screen market.
Compared with the comprehensive market positioning of LCD TVs, laser TVs are obviously more focused on the large-screen market, or in other words, laser TVs are products born for large screens.
Currently, the mainstream LCD TV size is from 55 inches to 65 inches, while the size of laser TV is generally more than 75 inches, and the largest is more than 100 inches, fully meeting the needs of users for large-screen color TVs.
In recent years, the shipments and sales share of laser TVs in the global market have been increasing, accounting for more than 60% of the total TV sales of 80 inches and above.
According to the prediction of Zhongyikang, the sales growth of laser TV market will exceed 140% in 2020 and continue to maintain high-speed growth.
The reason why it has achieved such a good result in the big screen market is mainly due to the excellent performance of the laser TV in eye protection.
Based on the imaging principle of laser TV diffuse reflection, the light emitted by the laser light source does not directly enter the eyeball. Compared with the backlight source of the LCD TV, the imaging process is closer to the imaging process of objects under natural conditions, and the stimulation to the eyes is also smaller.
The Sai Xi Laboratory of the China Institute of Electronics Standardization and the ophthalmology experts of the Beijing Union Medical College Hospital conducted a strict comparison experiment between watching laser TV and LCD TV under the same conditions of the crowd, and obtained 144 sets of test data.
The data confirmed that the laser TV does indeed have a strong eye protection feature, and even has a certain improvement effect in certain aspects.
At a time when visual health is becoming more and more important, laser TVs have not only attracted more and more users with their eye protection advantages, but also opened another breakthrough in the color TV market.
Second, laser TVs are more focused on the high-end market.
In contrast to the falling prices of LCD TVs, the current prices of laser TVs on the market are mostly more than 10,000 yuan, and the prices are gradually rising as the size and light source are upgraded.
Why is the laser TV so expensive?
It does make sense.
With the continuous development of light sources and technology levels, laser TVs have many advantages that LCD TVs and projectors cannot achieve.
With the ultra-short focal length projection technology, the projection distance of the laser TV is relatively shorter than that of traditional projection devices. It can achieve a 100-inch large-screen experience in a short distance. The required space is not large, and the host is compact and occupies very little space.
In terms of brightness, large-brand laser TVs can reach more than 2000 lumens.
In addition, it generates less heat, causing less damage to the equipment, and the life of the TV is also longer.
In addition, many high-end laser TVs are equipped with true 4K ultra-high-definition picture quality, artificial intelligence system, and bionic screen, which can bring users a more shocking audio-visual experience.
It cannot be said that it is a false demand, but it is a product of demand segmentation. In terms of picture quality and input-output ratio, laser TV is not suitable for audio and video players. If you want to take into account the large screen and the lack of viewing environment, you can try it. Everything has advantages and disadvantages. You can weigh the pros and cons and make your own judgment. I'm afraid to listen to one-sided words.
In simple terms, ultra-wide-angle short-focus projectors - laser TVs - have to use expensive ultra-wide-angle lenses and reflectors to get close to the screen, which is not in line with the best optical design.
To shield some of the ambient light, the micro-structured Fresnel screen is expensive, and the price of an 80-inch screen can basically be exchanged for a 65-inch LCD.
And one more thing, I especially hate the fact that projection manufacturers use the fact that diffuse reflection is good for the eyes as a selling point. Come on, the light on the screen that the eyes can see is direct light for the eyes. When you diffuse it to the ceiling, the eyes can't see it. If you insist, the LCD TV is also a "direct diffuse" light. When you turn on the TV, isn't the ceiling also illuminated?
Moreover, if the projection screen is not a diffuse reflection, it will not form an image at all.
The hot spot (light spot) effect of the high-gain screen was just ignored. A large amount of light was reflected into the eyes at a certain angle, which was really uncomfortable.
The Visual Aesthetics Photography Museum selected a quality store, which has no branches for the time being.
After adding the WeChat appointment date, the little sister arranged the available time and sent it to me. The information reply was timely~
Before going, I looked at the shooting works in the store. There were more outdoor wedding dresses, which were very beautiful, and there were many shooting styles involved.
After that day, I had a simple exchange of ideas with the little sister, and she was very patient to help me try on two styles of clothes that I was indecisive about, and finally settled on the makeup style~ Before the photographer took the photos, he would place some props and guide the movements, and he was also very meticulous about every detail.
But maybe because I didn’t communicate my specific shooting ideas to him, so what he shot wasn’t the style I wanted, but it should be good-looking 🙊🙊
After the shoot, the photographer will help to select the photos, communicate the post-production style, and it feels pretty careful.
It takes about half a month to fix it, and wait for the effect~
It was the second time I won the photo-related big meal activity. Most of the clothes in the field could be chosen to be photographed.
In the end, I chose a black tulle skirt to experience a different style.
The entire shooting process took about 2 hours, including makeup and shooting. The photographer in charge of shooting was a younger brother born in 1995. I felt that he was a little green. I hope that he will give more suggestions in terms of customer shooting action guidance in the future. He was quite talkative, and the shooting process was pleasant.
Photography Museum of Visual Aesthetics Selected Quality Store Reply
Queenie is on the front page, come and have a look~
First fill in the name and phone number when you arrive at the store, and then select the clothing. The wedding dress can also be selected. After changing three or four sets of clothing, it is quite patient. After the selection, the makeup was done for a long time, and the service attitude was also good. After the shooting, they will teach you how to pose. The feeling of the picture is that the face is too big, and the retouching is said to take half a month, and three or four days will be sent. It feels like there is no difference with the original picture.
[Environment] The overall environment is pretty good.
There are lots of clothes to choose from.
There were about three places for makeup, and inside was a photography studio.
The service was enthusiastic and attentive.
Stylists are very patient.
Photographers will also take time to teach you how to pose.
If the photographer is not satisfied, he or she will also take the initiative to re-shoot.
[Experience] The shape may be a little too much, and the original double eyelids were pasted into three eyelids.
The tail of the eyebrows were also shaved, which is a little embarrassing for those who don’t usually draw their eyebrows.
The photos were given to me ten days later, but I was not very satisfied with the P-picture effect. I felt that the double eyelids were still very obvious.
Because I did not know what style I wanted, I tried on two sets, and in the end, I chose the black dress. The young lady said that this set was a retro Hepburn style.
After choosing the clothes, I started doing my hair and make-up. The hairstylist and make-up artist were both very patient with me, and I was very satisfied with the results.
After the makeup, I started taking pictures. The photographer directed me to pose the whole time. The process was very easy and harmonious.
After the shoot, I carefully selected four of my favorite photos to be retouched. The little brother said that it would be finished in 15 minutes. I was very satisfied with the end result.
I haven't received a reply in 3 days...because your system can't recognize my credit card, I can't join the #PRS_ORG# monthly fee plan!
The strangest thing was that I used the same credit card every time I paid
Now I have to pay for shipping every time
I can be exempted first, and you can collect my monthly fee after you have investigated, is that okay?
Is it reliable to buy insurance for a small umbrella?
Xiaoyu Umbrella is an Internet insurance brokerage platform.
From the perspective of setting conditions: according to the prompt of the "Regulations on the Supervision of Insurance Brokerage Institutions (Revised in 2015)", becoming an insurance brokerage company must meet three key words: shareholders, founders have no major illegal records in the past 3 years, the minimum amount is RMB 50 million, and it must be approved by the China Insurance Regulatory Commission.
These three points are actually very strict. To sum up, it is necessary to have strength, to be approved by the national authority department of the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (which regulates insurance companies and banks in the country), and the shareholders must have a good attitude. As a small umbrella insurance of the insurance brokerage company, the policyholder does not need to doubt too much whether the small umbrella insurance is regular or not. After all, there are these three thresholds, which cannot be reached by any insurance company.
At this point, it's not bad and it's trustworthy.
From the perspective of insurance products: Xiaoyusan insurance is an insurance supermarket. Many companies' star serious illness insurance are sold on this platform, such as the newly listed and Thai Super Mary 5 No. serious illness insurance. The claimant and the insurer are both and Thai Life. Xiaoyusan insurance is just a third-party intermediary, and there is no need to question its reliability.
In terms of payment mode: Internet platform products, because of the lack of operating costs of the business outlets and the cost of staff wages, Internet products are generally cost-effective, and the payment method is flexible, supporting monthly payment, reducing the payment pressure of the insured, and at the same time maximizing the leverage of insurance.
That's pretty good.
It can be considered.
In terms of the professionalism of the salesperson: this is especially important, because insurance is a highly professional industry, and many Internet product customers can buy insurance by themselves. This will lead to a lot of misunderstandings. In terms of health disclosure and occupation, non-insurance practitioners often add their own subjective consciousness when applying for insurance. They think they are healthy or meet the requirements, which will easily lead to many claims risks and may be refused.
I myself have done insurance telemarketing in “Tencent Micro Insurance” (just like an umbrella, it is also an online insurance brokerage platform), and I am very responsible to tell you.
Internet insurance is real and reliable, but it is not reliable for people. There are no professional practitioners in Internet channels, and there are many sales misleading.
For example, 1-yuan insurance covers 6 million, buy insurance and get a mobile phone, and receive 60,000 critical illness insurance for free. These marketing strategies are not wrong, but they evade the main issue and do not tell the policyholders that the first month is 1 yuan, and the second month is charged at the normal rate, which varies from dozens to 200. Many customers do not know what they bought after paying the fee for one or two years.
I thought I could spend $1 and the insurance company would pay $6 million (a pie in the sky).
Free mobile phones are sent to special policy numbers, such as 6666, 8888, and if you win the prize and do not exchange it, no one will remind you.
(This is another pit for the insured person) The free 60,000 critical illness coverage is short-term. If you only rely on this, without other commercial insurance, in case of a real critical illness, what can the 60,000 do? It cannot solve the problem, and the future life begins to run naked.
At present, the state is also cracking down on the misguidance of insurance sales on the Internet.
In conclusion, there is no problem with the platform, no problem with the product, and the problem lies in the professionalism and professional ethics of the business personnel.
It is suggested that the host consider comprehensively and carefully. In fact, many offline insurance brokerage companies have a wider range of products. Customers can choose more opportunities and products, and some products have a better cost-benefit ratio than Internet products.
I have helped 59 Internet customers to insure offline products, and each of them has saved 2,000-3,000 yuan per year.
If you have any questions, please feel free to communicate and exchange with me.
I: Mingya Insurance Broker, with three years of corporate management training experience, has served nearly a thousand corporate users and cooperated with more than 100 insurance companies. Before applying for insurance, I will start from the customer's needs and customize insurance products for the customer. In the process of applying for insurance, I will compare three for the customer and try to get the best underwriting results for the customer. After applying for insurance, I will sort out the policy for the customer, manage the policy, and make the customer feel at ease and worry-free.
Grow with every customer for a lifetime.
I hope my answer can help the questioner!
According to the definition of the insurance regulatory department, Internet insurance refers to the insurance business in which the insured can independently complete all the insurance procedures after clicking on the insurance link.
In this process, the policyholder does not need to sign and the insurance consultant does not need to sign. All steps can be completed by the policyholder independently.
Although the purchase of internet insurance is not very "ceremonial", and may not even have a printed paper contract, this does not affect the validity and legal effect of the electronic contract.
This model is somewhat similar to a "telephone sales" type of assembly line work, but there is a fatal problem with purchasing insurance in this way: follow-up service may not keep up.
Insurance is usually a long-term contract that lasts for several decades. When we buy insurance, should we seriously think about whether the "intermediary" we choose is a "insurance intermediary" who can accompany us for a long time and provide services to us many years later?

Thank you for your help
From the past to the present, I have always opposed any form of slander and verbal abuse, and I cannot accept such personal attacks.
In a civilized society, we can tolerate everything, but we must prevent this kind of scoundrel.
If you don't look at parties and factions, the first thing to resist is this kind of uncivilized style.
From the Facebook friend request you sent me, to the sarcastic post you published, to your attempt to publish what you claimed to be my home address and my father's name on social media, I have adopted an attitude of non-response.
Afterward, you continued to tag me at the rate of six meals a day, and continued to discuss some implicit and humiliating remarks about me with your so-called friends on Facebook, such as my looks, body shape, good care, and whether to plant strawberries on the bed or not. I... just let it go.
But later on, I received messages from several friends about your Facebook friend account with a photo of you and words with sexual harassment elements.
I'm sorry, as a woman, I can no longer remain silent.
After the news of me calling the police was uploaded, you didn't restrain yourself at all, but instead became even more arrogant.
I don't care what your political background is, I don't care what your status or position is, in our society, we need two-way respect.
Yes, you can continue to make snide, veiled, humiliating, insulting remarks, you can continue to say that you just care and are concerned about me, you can continue to think that this is not harassment, and you can even continue to deny that you made the picture or continue to make any offensive remarks.
That's right, I can't, and I don't have the power to stop you.
I don't know you, I don't want to know you, and my appearance and body shape don't need your evaluation.
I don't even think there's a girl that would want to be humiliated like that for fame.
A friend asked, "How are you doing?"
I told you, you wouldn't believe me.
I don't think any girl would be able to say they're okay after being bullied like that.
Only those who have no basic moral principles will choose to hurt any woman in this way, whether at work, in society, in politics or in business.
I believe that justice is in the hearts of the people.
I cut some of the comments for you to listen to.
No one should be able to impersonate you on your own posts
All I can say is that you are a public enemy of civilization.
A smile from the heart
Vietnam People’s Newspaper Network - Prime Minister of Vietnam Pham Minh Chinh attended the 3rd Vietnam National Forum on the Development of Digital Technology Enterprises

The household appliances here are quite complete and there are many brands, including all the well-known brands.

Actually Home has a total of 11 floors, from -2 to 9, and -1 and -2 are parking places, and parking is free during the day!
The surroundings are not very good. There are only a few hardware stores, and the taste of the hotel is average.
This elevator is also speechless, just like having a big illness, negative two to negative one, back and forth, keep pressing this floor, and from the safety corridor to the first floor, it is also very speechless, directly connected to a furniture store, the furniture store is closed, and the safety corridor can't get out!

The Yangtze River’s main channel achieves full coverage of the water green comprehensive service area - Xinhua News Agency
Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, December 11 (Reporter Wang Xian) The water green comprehensive service area in Fuling, Chongqing was completed and put into operation as scheduled on the 10th. This is the second water green comprehensive service area to be officially operated in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River after the water green comprehensive service area in Luzhou, Sichuan was officially operated on the 8th.
So far, the water green comprehensive service area has covered the upper, middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River.
Qiu Jianhua, Deputy Director-General of the Yangtze River Navigation Administration of the Ministry of Transport, said that previously, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, Jiangsu and other provinces had built and operated 10 water green comprehensive service areas in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, which was recognized by a large number of seafarers and played an important role in promoting the high-quality development of Yangtze River shipping.
The full coverage of the water-based green comprehensive service area is another milestone in the construction of the Yangtze River green shipping. The Yangtze River ship pollutant reception and shipping service capacity have been significantly improved.
It is reported that the water green comprehensive service area is an important facility to provide all-round production and living services for a large number of ships and crew, and help a large number of crew solve the problems of "urgent, difficult, worry and expectation".
The two water-based green comprehensive service areas completed and put into operation this time, integrate life services, production services and government services into one, with green and environmental protection as the theme, with ship repair and ship emergency rescue services as the features, and achieve “one docking, multiple services” for ships in the port, which will make the work of the crews on the Yangtze River more efficient and life more convenient.
The three U.S. aircraft carriers gather around China, and the most powerful weapon in the U.S. Navy’s arsenal makes a rare visit to Guam. 2022-01-17 Multi-dimensional: The latest news of Sino-U.S. relations: The latest satellite image shows that the three U.S. aircraft carriers are gathering around China; the U.S. media also disclosed that one of the most powerful weapons in the U.S. Navy’s arsenal made a rare visit to Guam, sending an important signal to the U.S. allies and enemies in the Indo-Pacific region.
According to the Chinese think tank “South China Sea Strategic Situation Perception Platform”, on January 9, the satellite found the American aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson near the Bab al-Mandeb Strait.
The Babarac Strait connects the South China Sea and the Sulu Sea, and is a strategic place on the first island chain in the western Pacific Ocean.
The platform is expected that the "Karl Vincent" will go to the South China Sea for deployment.
This is the first deployment of the F-35C fighter jet and the CMV-22 Osprey carrier-based transport aircraft on the "Carl Vinson" aircraft carrier.
In addition to the "Carl Vincent" aircraft carrier, the "Abraham Lincoln" aircraft carrier (USS Abraham Lincoln) that departed from the United States on January 3 is now sailing in the Pacific Ocean.
The "Lincoln" also carried the F-35C carrier squadron for the first time, which is under the 314th Fighter Attack Squadron of the United States Marine Corps.
In addition to the two aircraft carriers mentioned above, there is also the USS Ronald Reagan aircraft carrier docked in Yokosuka, Japan, which is currently deployed by the U.S. Navy in the Asia-Pacific region.
The aircraft carrier battle group also includes the guided missile cruiser USS Champlain and the guided missile destroyer USS Stockdale.
Three US aircraft carriers gather in China's neighborhood, and the most powerful weapon makes a rare visit to Guam. On January 17, 2022, the "South China Sea Strategic Situation Perception Platform" released the latest satellite images, showing that the US military was gathering three aircraft carriers around China.
(Weibo@South China Sea Strategic Situation Probing Initiative) Three U.S. aircraft carriers gather in the vicinity of China, and the most powerful weapon makes a rare visit to Guam. On January 17, 2022, the flight route of the U.S. military transport aircraft CMV-22B.
(Weibo @South China Sea Strategic Situation Probing Initiative) According to CNN's report on January 17, one of the most powerful weapons in the U.S. Navy's arsenal made a rare visit to Guam over the weekend.
The Ohio-class nuclear submarine USS Nevada, carrying 20 Trident (Trident) ballistic missiles and dozens of nuclear warheads, entered the U.S. Naval Base in Guam on Saturday (January 15).
The three US aircraft carriers gathered around China, the most powerful weapon, made a rare visit to Guam. Analysts said that this sent a signal to allies and enemies in the increasingly tense situation in the Indo-Pacific region.
This is the first visit by a U.S. ballistic missile submarine to Guam since 2016 and the second public visit to Guam since the 1980s.
The three aircraft carriers of the United States gathered in the vicinity of China, and the most powerful weapon made a rare visit to Guam. In recent years, China has built a large number of military facilities on the Nansha Islands.
This is Yongshu Island in the South China Sea.
(South Sea Research Forum) The U.S. Navy said in a statement that the visit of the Ohio-class nuclear submarine "Nevada" to Guam this time strengthened cooperation between the United States and its allies in the region, demonstrated the capabilities, flexibility, combat readiness, and continued commitment of the United States to the security and stability of the Indo-Pacific region.
Ballistic missile submarines are often called "boomer" submarines.
The whereabouts of the 14 "rumbling submarines" in the U.S. Navy fleet are usually strictly kept secret.
The secrecy surrounding ballistic missile submarines has made the "Thunderbolt submarine" the most important survival weapon in the nuclear triad, and this system also includes the ballistic missile launched from the mainland of the United States, as well as the B-2 and B-52 bombers capable of carrying nuclear warheads.
When talking to friends about the recent 26% drop in Meta and the evaporation of $251 billion in market value, Zuckerberg responded with "unprecedented competition". Why?
Meta (formerly Facebook) is essentially an advertising company, and its income mainly comes from advertising. The advertising company that makes money today has its own traffic channels.
Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and so on, are all traffic channels of Meta, regardless of their functional positioning.
In addition, Meta is the largest "ad alliance". Many apps rely on Meta's advertising platform for monetization.
Times have changed, though.
First, due to the changes in Apple's privacy policy, it is difficult for Meta to obtain user data information, which has affected the efficiency of advertising.
Apple's current privacy policy is user-friendly, and it will clearly prompt the user whether to allow the app to obtain their information, and most people's normal reaction is definitely not to allow it.
If Google stabs another stab, the impact on Meta's income will be even greater.
Second, the Chinese factor in Meta's previous revenue growth has also been weakened (the proportion of this factor is uncertain, but it does exist).
Everyone knows that Meta has no business in China, but this understanding is not accurate.
Every year, at least 10% of Meta's income comes from China, mainly contributed by companies that do overseas business in China.
Meta has a few hundred people in its Hong Kong office, and several large agents in mainland China.
Chinese companies want to expand overseas markets, and Meta is an unavoidable advertising channel. Most of the money spent is given to Meta.
It is interesting that now, Byte's TT is one of Meta's main competitors, but Meta earned a lot of money from Byte in the past two years.
Domestic agencies are helping ByteDance to advertise on Meta, and Meta's performance in Greater China is also very good.
I haven't gone out of my way to find out recently, but it can't be any better than it was before.
The stage of Chinese companies burning money overseas has passed.
Thirdly, the expansion of new traffic channels is not smooth.
Facebook is getting older, and new platforms such as TT are not in the hands of Meta.
The biggest problem is not just falling incomes but the lack of growth expectations.
Capital markets not only look at income, but more importantly, they look at the expectations for the future.
Clearly, Meta's expectations were too low.
In order to tell a new story to the market, Zuckerberg talked about "metaverse".
The metaverse is indeed one of the future directions, but the implementation cycle of the metaverse is relatively long. This story should not be enough to support Meta's market value in the next two or three years.
Therefore, the next two years should be a difficult time for Meta.
Don't look at Facebook's current prosperity, with annual revenue of $100 billion to $200 billion, in fact, Facebook now has a very strong sense of crisis, and it has no good and safe moat compared with other Internet enterprises and high-tech companies.
Although his several social software has a high daily active users now, they are also mainstream social software, such as Facebook, WhatsApp, etc., but in the face of TikTok's rapid development, Facebook has no confidence, and the subversion is just a blink of an eye.
In a short period of time, there is no hope of success for the unattainable concept of the metaverse, so Facebook is very dangerous. This is also the fundamental reason why Zuckerberg changed the name of the company and kept looking for new tracks. However, I think his track selection is wrong, and it is a dead end. The above are some of my thoughts for your reference.
