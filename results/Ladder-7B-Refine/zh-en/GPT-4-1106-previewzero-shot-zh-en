At the Zhejiang University Academic Annual Conference, students sang the leading role, and the research results opened up people's minds - Xinhua Net
Washing hands with air, judging diseases by breathing, and accurately searching for smog sources Last night, at the opening ceremony of the 2016 Academic Annual Conference of Zhejiang University, a series of academic achievements with wide-ranging ideas were commended.
The main researchers of these achievements are students. The research covers major areas such as environment, machinery, energy, medicine, life sciences, and humanities education. The students started from a curious idea and created many high-end inventions with application value. Some projects have won awards both at home and abroad.
Bio-sensor: Your home doctor
The team of Zhang Diming, a doctoral student of the School of Biomedical Engineering, demonstrated a biosensor for smartphones on site, which is only half the size of a smartphone.
"All you have to do is take a deep breath, and this set of equipment can preliminarily detect the health of your body from the gas components you exhale. "
Zhang Diming explained that this set of sensors is connected to a smart phone, and the health report will be displayed on the phone after exhaling.
In the market, the intelligent wristbands that can detect health status usually detect physical parameters such as temperature and pulse.
This set of biological sensors uses a new material called graphene. Its target is chemical elements, and its sensitive "sense of smell" allows it to reflect the body's health status more deeply and accurately.
Intelligent surgical light: doctors' high-energy eyes
In addition to smart mobile phones, smart surgical lights are also used in the operating room.
This invention won a silver award at the 44th Geneva International Invention Exhibition in Switzerland this year.
Zhu Linjing and Shen Junfei, masters students of the School of Optoelectronic Science and Engineering, have opened up a new idea in the defects of traditional surgical lamps, and invented the intelligent LED surgical shadowless lamp.
"Many diseases are not detected in the early stage, and the resection is not accurate, which is related to the lights used by doctors in the operating room. "
Shen Junfei said that for example, if the doctor cannot see all of the tumor tissues in time during an early cancer check-up, then the cancer cells will continue to spread.
This intelligent surgical light has four lamp plates, which can enhance the difference between different tissues under illumination by adjusting the spectrum.
During the operation, the doctor can adjust the size, brightness, spectrum, color uniformity and shadowless rate of the light spot at any time according to the needs of the operation and personal habits.
This intelligent surgical light has been tested in hospitals such as Zhejiang University School of Medicine Affiliated Shao Yifu Hospital and Zhejiang University School of Medicine Affiliated Children's Hospital, and has received good feedback.
Last October, this invention won the first prize in the National Challenge Cup.
Washing hands with air: saving water and cool
Ordinary people just rinse their hands with water, at most they wipe some soap, squeeze some hand sanitizer, and Li Qizhang and his classmates invented a set of "air hand washing device".
Just stand at the device's sink and our weight will compress the air out.
"It's like a defibrillator.
The compressed air forms a stream of fluid at the tap and combines with the water.
That way, we can wash our hands clean! "
The visible reaction and bacterial residue tests prove that the effect of hand washing by this method is the same as the ordinary hand washing method.
This device only needs to rely on our own gravity as a drive, which can ensure the degree of cleaning and save 90% of water, and the whole process is completely energy-free and energy-saving and environmentally friendly.
Last year, at the second Global Major Challenges Summit, this invention stood out among many of the world's top universities and won the only gold award.

A meaningful certificate – First Aid Certificate
This is one of the skill certificates that I feel is important, in addition to my driver's license!
For your information: First aid measures are actually emergency rescue in the event of an emergency, that is, rescue before the ambulance arrives.
It is well known that there is actually a period of time between the accident and the arrival of the ambulance, and it is this period of time that is the most critical.
This is when first aid is needed.
If I really had a heart attack, a stroke, or respiratory arrest, our window of life is only four minutes, the golden four minutes!
That's why it's so important for people around you to know first aid!
When someone around us falls, we can use our professional knowledge to save him, instead of standing there foolishly and doing nothing. This feeling of powerlessness is terrible.
"In China, according to our official data, there are 300,000 accidental deaths every year, and the most dangerous one is called sudden cardiac arrest.
In the United States, on average, 15% can be saved.
In Las Vegas, 70 to 80 per cent can be saved, but in Shanghai and Beijing, it is less than 1 per cent."
This was said by Lu Le, the founder of First Response.
If a person suffers from sudden cardiac arrest, with no breathing and no heartbeat, pinching the philtrum is useless.
It was only possible to save the person by doing artificial respiration and external chest compressions.
I find that there are not many people who have the awareness to learn first aid, but when things happen, it's too late. Therefore, I still call on everyone to learn this skill so that we can react in time when we face an emergency.
It could even save a life!
You can sign up for a first aid certificate at your local Red Cross training center. I signed up at the Red Cross training center in Zhuhai, and students get a discount.
P.S. The last photo is a record of the goals I wanted to achieve before I was 25 years old, and adding the first aid certificate to the goal list was something I did a few months ago, but I did it!
After that, I will go to take other certificates that I want to take. I plan to take a diving certificate. I saw on Xiaohongshu that there is also a diving first aid certificate. To take this certificate, it seems that you must have a first aid certificate first, so the first aid certificate is actually very useful!
I ordered ＃#NUMBER#
One shrimp dumpling for 13 yuan?
I haven't tried it.
How can #NAME# not be written clearly?
One for 13 yuan?
Yesterday, #PRS_ORG# missed the delivery of meals. This time, they just gave me a shrimp dumpling to eat?
Because I clearly saw it was valid when I input the code before.
Let's talk about the conclusion first. I personally think that "The Four Seas" is a full-scale bad movie, in every sense of the word.
But you can't say this movie doesn't have a bright spot, at least the soundtrack is pretty good.
There are many kinds of bad films. The kind that makes you fall asleep in the cinema is one of them. The kind that makes you indignant after watching it is also one of them. "Four Seas" is like a monkey on Emei Mountain to the audience. It can ignite your anger in countless ways.
In terms of insulting the audience, Han Han is really talented.
The most painful thing about this film is that it seems to be a creation in a Cthulhu novel, indescribable, and riddled with holes like the windbreaker on Little Marco's body.
Even after watching it, you'd wonder if there was some hidden meaning the director was trying to convey, but when you think about it, it's just a pile of crap.
First, I'd like to talk about some plots that I find hard to understand.
The male protagonist should live on a small island in the south and rely on his grandmother.
Her grandmother had a wish to see snow, and then the plot arranged for an uncle in the neighborhood to take her to Northeast China to see the snow in a minivan.
Elderly people take a van from the south to the northeast to see snow??
He and his dad are very confident about it.
Then the old man had nothing more to say.
How did the main character’s brother get a business license to open a hotel on an abandoned ship?
Why can the little hooligans of the racing party on the island easily block a section of the mountain road?
Then the truck in the middle of the road stopped by the side of the road, and even the truck driver couldn't be found around.
This prop is too obvious, isn't it?
Why would a small hoodlum with a poor credit record and illegal suspicion become a police officer?
In the face of usury, why not call the police? In the movie, the police even asked if there were any difficulties?
An adult knows how to use a smart phone, but doesn't know how to use the room card to open the hotel door, and then forcibly arrange to find the hotel owner and sleep outside the room door?
This bizarre plotline pervaded the entire film to the point where I found it painful to recall them.
Worse than the plot is the film's message, or lack thereof, which is a hideous Frankenstein's monster.
At the beginning of the film, you'll think he's making a comedy. Twenty minutes later, you'll guess it might be an inspirational film. Halfway through, you'll think it might be a film that wants to show the difficulties of young people in a small town. After watching it, you don't know what kind of film you have watched, followed by deep self-doubt. Why go to the cinema during the Spring Festival to watch excrement.
Most people are actually very familiar with the routines of various movies. For example, if you want to shoot a motorcyclist, it will be inspirational + comedy, and then tell the audience how a talented rookie step by step towards success.
If you want to shoot a love film, then you should talk about the love-hate relationship between a small-town young man who likes to ride a motorcycle and a waitress girl.
If you want to reflect reality, at the very least, your plot can't contain things that are contrary to the real world.
(For example, the new motorcycle played by Yin Zheng was just burned, and then he could still sing), you can't open some brain holes that even Kennedy can't stand.
As for the fact that the heroine is not a moron but acts like a 5-year-old in some aspects, I really don't know if this is due to acting skills or the director's requirements.
There is one thing that I don't quite understand. As a race car driver, why is Han Han so keen to add car crash scenes to his own movies?
Such a film arrangement in the Spring Festival, is it to add trouble to the audience?

Check the concrete module production and processing equipment of the inspection well Zhengzhou well wall brick module equipment introduction:
Zhengzhou Yixin is a domestic manufacturer of concrete inspection well module brick machine equipment, inspection well block machinery, and well-wall wall module machinery, ranging from semi-automatic to fully automated production lines.
After years of practice and development, we now have high-quality products, mainly producing hydraulic, mobile, and fully automated inspection well series devices and supporting devices.
Check the concrete module production and processing equipment Zhengzhou well wall brick module equipment assembly site:
Check the concrete module production processing equipment Zhengzhou well wall brick module equipment features and advantages:
The Yixin inspection well block brick machine equipment is widely applicable to new building materials for municipal underground structures such as coal, heat, water, electricity, and gas.
For example, various inspection wells, rainwater outlets, square ditches, septic tanks and small constructions, bridge wing walls, etc. for drainage and water storage facilities.
The advantage of using concrete modules to build inspection wells is that the modules have grooves on all four sides, up, down, left and right, which can be combined to form a chain lock.
The shear strength of the well wall is far superior to that of the flat friction masonry form.
The module is a hollow structure, and after the combination is built, the vertical holes are connected, and the horizontal holes are connected. After the core is poured, a cast-in-place concrete network structure is formed, which plays the role of secondary reinforcement and waterproofing.
Both the length and width of the modules are equipped with rebar grooves, which correspondingly improve the overall strength of the structure with the longitudinal rebar and transverse rebar.
In addition, the inspection wells and drainage wells built using concrete inspection well modules are not prone to collapse, subsidence, and leakage. The mechanical properties of the well wall modules are stable, and the operation is simple, and the formed size is standard.
The concrete inspection well module brick machine device is equipped with intelligent control, data input and output devices, one-key touch LCD display to monitor the entire mechanical operation process, realizing the ideal human-machine dialogue, automatic analysis and comparison of materials, density operation, safe logic control and fault diagnosis system.
The mechanical and hydraulic system of the well wall panel module adopts single-cylinder hydraulic transmission and dual-cylinder hydraulic transmission.
The independent hydraulic integration station avoids the impact of the host vibration on the hydraulic system and ensures the reliability of the hydraulic system.
The concrete inspection well module brick machine equipment, cloth box, moving mold box, demolding and rising, storage bin door closing, automatic conveying pallet, all of which are independently completed by the hydraulic system, so as to achieve the purpose of reducing the wear and maintenance of the machinery.
The concrete inspection well module brick machine equipment adopts imported computer, electrical equipment, sealing and hydraulic parts, and the comprehensive performance of the equipment is stable and reliable.
The mechanical vibration platform of the well-wall panel module is made of a whole plate steel, and the surface of the platform is cut in line without welding points, which allows the filler box to move freely and guide, and fully reduces the mechanical wear.
Reduce mold load, fill and two-in-one encryption amplitude, and adopt integrated and full synchronization of platform vibration and mold vibration to ensure the compaction effect.
The wall module of the well wall uses mechanical excitation and computer automatic control of amplitude to adjust the amplitude according to the cost performance ratio of the raw materials. There is no wear-and-tear braking, thereby extending the service life and reducing costs.
The well wall body modules have dual functions of mechanical automatic control and manual control.

Chongqing vocational school pilot modern apprenticeship, admission is equivalent to an employee of the enterprise - Xinhua News Agency
Yesterday, reporters learned from the Municipal Education Commission that starting this year, our city will pilot the "modern apprenticeship" talent training model in 60 middle and vocational schools, and the students who receive the pilot training will simultaneously have the status of apprentices. After enrollment, they will be pre-enrolled by the pilot enterprises as unit employees.
The municipal education commission requires that the enrollment and admission procedures of secondary vocational schools and the employment procedures of enterprises should be standardized, and the dual identity of apprentices in secondary vocational schools and enterprises should be clarified. According to the principle of mutual choice, apprentices, schools and enterprises should sign a three-party agreement. For apprentices who have reached 16 years of age but have not reached 18 years of age, an agreement should be signed by the apprentice, the guardian, the school and the enterprise to determine the rights and interests of each party and the specific positions, teaching content, and rights protection for the on-the-job training of apprentices.
Encouraged pilot schools to adopt the modern apprenticeship form to jointly carry out pre-job training and post-job training with cooperative enterprises.
The pilot schools need to reform the mode of talent training.
The school and the enterprise jointly designed a talent training scheme, jointly formulated professional teaching standards, course standards, job standards, enterprise master standards, quality monitoring standards and corresponding implementation plans.
The pilot will take the training system as a pilot cycle, and the internship time of students in enterprises will be determined according to the professional talent training plan. The on-the-job internship is usually 6 months.
In enterprise practice, the enterprise group management model should be implemented. According to the characteristics of different professions, one master can lead 2 to 5 apprentices to form a learning group to ensure that the students are proficient in the skills required for each training post.
According to the arrangement, from 2016 to August 2019, the city will determine 60 municipal-level modern apprenticeship pilots in three batches, with each pilot having about 50 people, and a total of about 3,000 students (apprentices) will be trained.
According to the principle of pilot first and then implementation, from point to face, we will explore the long-term mechanism of school-enterprise joint enrollment, joint training and integrated education, and truly improve students’ job skills, and increase the rate and quality of students’ employment.

South African doctor: Omicron is highly transmissible, but mostly mild
Many doctors and medical experts in South Africa believe that the symptoms caused by the COVID-19 Omicron variant are milder than those caused by the Delta variant, although it spreads faster.
According to the Associated Press, as the omicron variant spreads in South Africa, a group of more than 5,000 doctors in Gauteng Province reported that the current symptoms of COVID-19 patients they are treating are relatively mild, such as body pain and cough, which are similar to flu symptoms.
Director Dr Unben Pillay said he sees dozens of patients a day but no one has needed to be hospitalised yet.
Pyle said: "They were able to control the disease at home, and most people recovered within 10 to 14 days of isolation. "
He said this includes older patients and those with health problems, who are more likely to become seriously ill from the coronavirus.
He said that compared with the last wave of the Delta epidemic, the new crown patients he treated had "difficulty breathing and low blood oxygen levels.
Many people will be hospitalized within a few days."
In the two weeks since the Omicron variant was first reported in southern Africa, other doctors have also shared similar experiences.
Although it will take several weeks to collect enough data, doctors' observations and early evidence provide some clues.
According to the South African National Institute for Communicable Diseases, only 30% of the newly hospitalized COVID-19 patients in recent weeks have severe symptoms, half of the proportion of severe cases in the previous wave of the epidemic; the average hospitalization time has been shortened from 8 days to 2.8 days; only 3% of the recent COVID-19 patients died, while the death rate was as high as 20% in the early outbreak cases in South Africa.
The director of the African Health Research Institute, Willem Hanekom, citing data from the National Institute of Communicable Diseases and other reports, said: "At present, almost all signs suggest that it is a milder disease. "
He added: "It's still early days and we need to get the late-stage data.
In general, hospitalization and death occur later, and we have only been in this wave of the epidemic for two weeks. "
At the same time, scientists around the world are monitoring case numbers and hospitalization rates, while testing the effectiveness of current vaccines and treatments.
While Delta remains the dominant COVID-19 variant worldwide, Omicron cases are popping up in dozens of countries, with South Africa as the epicenter of the outbreak.
Gauteng has seen a 400% increase in new cases in the first week of December, with more than 90% of cases testing positive for the Omicron variant, according to health officials.
Thank you to today's supporters, all 80 boxes have been sent out!

Education commentary: What does it take to save a kidnapped child?
If we compare it with the famous public service slogan “there is no killing without selling”, in a good environment where there is no demand for “abducting and selling”, group prevention and group governance, and the whole nation fighting against abducting and selling, will make the act of abducting and selling unprofitable, risky and high-cost, so that this kind of crime will not occur again and again.
Recently, the child missing information emergency release platform developed by the Anti-Trafficking Division of the Criminal Investigation Department of the Ministry of Public Security was online.
This is an Internet information platform established for the establishment of an authoritative channel for the release of missing children’s information and the timely recovery of abducted children.
Having heard that the app was called "Reunion", I felt a sense of warmth.
The new technology not only has the name of "literature and art" and is full of feelings, but also uses information technology properly, which is practical and effective.
The primary goal of anti-trafficking enforcement is to find the abducted children and protect their personal safety and freedom.
The second is the trial and punishment of the suspect.
The significance of criminal punishment, from individual punishment, social prevention to legal education, can be listed with many "big words".
However, before a trafficking case is solved, the safety of the victims should be the first priority.
According to the urgency of the matter, under the urgent purpose of “seeking help”, controversial topics such as “whether child trafficking should be sentenced to death” can be put aside for the time being and discussed cautiously, but the rescue of the abducted children cannot wait.
According to the experience of handling such cases, human traffickers are used to moving away from the scene of the crime as soon as possible after they succeed.
If the search for missing children is delayed by one minute, the child will be one step further away from the parents, and the difficulty of solving the case will increase by one point.
In this case, it is a pragmatic action to come up with effective methods such as the "Reunion" platform to directly help solve cases and find children.
After all, "anti-beating" is a big task that requires the operation of the entire legal system to do well.
Fighting against crime, ensuring the rights and interests of children and their parents, from the improvement of legislation, to the protection of the law, and the meticulousness of law enforcement, all need to implement the care of "protecting children and supporting the weak".
In addition, the prevention of child trafficking can also be better from the family to the society.
For example, a common case is that a family of three is resting at the train station, and the parents fall asleep. When they wake up, they find that the child is missing.
You can't expect a two-year-old to have enough self-protection skills, but as a parent of a young child, you should at least have some protective awareness.
The most basic way to prevent children from being abducted is for the parents to take turns to rest or place the child in a safe environment.
On the other side of the police crackdown on human trafficking, the buyer of trafficked children should also be paid attention to and punished.
A single illegal act is often just one link in a long chain.
According to the Criminal Law of our country, the legal punishment for child trafficking starts from 5 years; in particularly serious circumstances, it can be sentenced to death and confiscation of property.
With a high starting point for sentencing and a heavy maximum penalty, the crime of child trafficking is obviously a crime with a heavier punishment under the trend of "lightening the punishment".
But there are still many cases of human trafficking every year.
It can be seen that some people have backward ideas in raising their children and have weak legal awareness.
Legal education for this group of people should be followed up at the same time.
In order to effectively control trafficking crimes, it is not enough to rely solely on strict law enforcement by the government.
If the "kidnapping" market is widespread, the kidnappers will be greedy and constantly innovate their kidnapping methods to form a "struggle" situation with the law enforcement, and the anti-kidnapping actions will inevitably fall into the low-efficiency quagmire.
Therefore, breaking outdated ideas and popularizing legal knowledge can also help eradicate the crime of buying and selling children.

He pointed out that the spirit of the National Congress, the spirit of General Secretary Xi Jinping's important speech and important instructions on Hunan, and the spirit of the provincial party congress should be combined to learn and integrate, enhance the ideological self-consciousness, political self-consciousness and action self-consciousness of defending the “Two Establishments” and doing the “Two Upholds”, and move forward in the direction indicated by General Secretary Xi Jinping.

He sincerely advised young party members to draw power from the 100-year history of the Party, closely unite around the Party Central Committee, unswervingly follow the Party, and use their youth to write responsibility and dedication.

In fact, I don't know whether it was the shop's error or the rider's error
There were no documents on the bag.
It can't be traced
I hope you understand
Because the delivery time was 30 minutes ahead of schedule
No, thank you
Yes, it has changed a rider

The restaurant has been saying it's working on it
After waiting for a few hours
The International Olive Oil Association divides olive oil into two large categories, virgin olive oil (Virgin Olive Oil) and refined olive oil (Lampante Olive Oil or Refined Olive Oil), and five levels.
Extra virgin olive oil or natural olive oil is a kind of oil obtained by mechanical cold pressing and filtration after removing impurities from fresh olives.
It can be classified into three levels according to its acidity:
Extra virgin olive oil: This is the highest level, highest quality olive oil and is a pure natural product.
The taste is excellent, with a delicate and pleasant plant fragrance, and the acidity does not exceed 1%.
Fine virgin olive oil (Fine Virgin): slightly higher acidity but not more than 2%, pure and fragrant in taste.
Ordinary virgin olive oil (Ordinary Virgin): The taste and flavor are acceptable, and the acid value does not exceed 3.3%.
Refined olive oil is the olive oil obtained by refining the extra virgin olive oil with an acid content of more than 3.3%, or it becomes "secondary oil".
There are two grades of refined olive oil:
Regular olive oil (Olive Oil): Refined olive oil mixed with a certain proportion of extra virgin olive oil to balance the taste and color, with an acidity of less than 1.5%, and a transparent light golden yellow color.
Refined olive-pomace oil or olive-residue oil: it is extracted from the olive pomace by the solvent method and then refined to obtain olive oil.
Having looked at the grading categories, you should already have noticed that the acidity of the olive oil is a very important indicator.
After all, just like the grapes used for making wine, olives from different regions and different types of olives will produce olive oil of different standards.
The best places for oil olives to grow:
The Mediterranean coast has the most suitable soil and temperature, sunlight, air humidity and rainfall for the growth of olive trees.
Other regions can only plant sporadically in suitable areas, except along the Mediterranean coast.
Main production areas (Mediterranean):
Italy, Spain, Greece, Turkey, Portugal, Morocco, Syria, Israel, Tunisia, Algeria, Egypt, Pakistan, Lebanon, and other countries, as well as Argentina, Peru, South Africa, and other countries far south of the equator, have similar climates.
Harvest months for oil olives:
March to June each year is the time for olive trees to bloom and bear fruit. From July to October, the fruit begins to develop and mature. The fruit changes color from green to red, purple, and finally black.
November to February is the harvest season (the freshness of the olive oil is very important).
Nutritional components of olive oil:
Olive oil is rich in monounsaturated fatty acids such as oleic acid, linoleic acid, and linolenic acid, as well as vitamins A, B, D, E, K, and antioxidants.
Olive oil is considered to be the most suitable oil for human nutrition of all the oils discovered so far.
Democracy summit ends with Biden saying flame of freedom will never go out
The online "Summit for Democracy" (Summit for Democracy) convened by U.S. President Biden, attended by government leaders and civil society and private sector leaders from 110 countries around the world, came to an end on Friday (December 10th).
Biden said in his closing speech that the fire of freedom burns in the hearts of everyone in the world, and the authoritarian government will never be able to extinguish it.
He also said that the second Global "Democracy Summit" is planned to be held next year.
Taiwan government representatives, Tang Feng, and Hong Kong pro-democracy and human rights activist Law Chi-kwong, who is currently in exile in the United Kingdom, also spoke at the summit on the second day.
Mr. Biden said: "We know how daunting the task ahead of us is.
But we also know that we can meet the challenge, as I've said before, as this summit demonstrates, democracy is everywhere.
A dictatorship will never be able to extinguish the tiny flame of freedom, which burns in the hearts of people all over the world and in every part of the world. "
Biden also said that defending democracy needs the joint efforts of the whole society.
He said, "As leaders of the government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, to strengthen the guardrails of democracy, to push for reforms, to achieve transparent and accountable governance, and to resist the forces of authoritarianism and those who seek power at the expense of the public interest. "
The second day of the "Democracy Summit" focused on defending human rights, consolidating democracy and countering authoritarianism, and countering digital authoritarianism and affirming democratic values.
This day coincides with "International Human Rights Day".
United Nations Secretary-General Guterres also said in his opening speech that day that the cause of democracy is facing challenges around the world, especially the challenges brought about by emerging digital technologies.
He said: "Now is the time to reaffirm our shared values and positions, and the resilience of our democracies.
This requires deepening social dialogue, addressing inequality, tackling corruption, updating social contracts, investing in quality education, and expanding opportunities for women and girls.
We also need to resolutely condemn all forms of populism, nationalism and extremism, including the use of all the tools provided by the technological revolution."
Hong Kong pro-democracy and human rights activist Law Chi-kwong made a speech at the summit through a pre-recorded video, reminding the participants to continue to pay attention to the human rights situation of Hong Kong and Chinese ethnic minorities such as Uyghurs and Tibetans.
He said: "For a long time, the world has been directly affected by the rise of China, but no mechanism has been established to hold it accountable.
That is why politicians and civil society leaders must work together.
We must use everything we have (resources) to make sure the revival of democracy is our top priority. "
Law also called on the free world to unite against the threat of the Chinese Communist Party.
He said: "Maybe some of you are afraid of angering President Xi Jinping, maybe some of you don't want to lose the Chinese market, and maybe some of you haven't realized the threat (the CCP) poses to our democratic values.
And that's why we failed.
That's why we need to change. "
At the roundtable discussion on “Combating Digital Dictatorship, Affirming Democratic Values”, Taiwan Executive Yuan Minister-without-Portfolio Tang Feng issued the “National Declaration” through a video, emphasizing that Taiwan stands at the forefront of countering authoritarianism and despotism.
He also shared his experiences in fighting COVID-19 through information transparency and building mutual trust.
He said, "At a time when Taiwan's democracy is on the rise, we are determined to stand at the forefront of the global fight against authoritarianism and play a leading role in promoting global freedom, democracy and human rights.
During the epidemic, various authoritarian governments have rationalized the violation of human rights in the name of public health and collective interests, and the global democracy has shown signs of regression.
However, in Taiwan, we do not need to lock down to control the epidemic, and we do not need to take down to defeat fake information. "
On the second day of the “Democracy Summit”, the US Treasury Department announced that it would implement sanctions on 15 individuals and 10 entities in several countries, including China and North Korea, which were determined to have severely violated human rights in accordance with the law. At the same time, investment restrictions were imposed on a Chinese company that was determined to have used surveillance technology to assist in the violation of human rights.
I've already taken a photo and sent it to you
I know.
But the restaurant didn't know why the delivery kept getting delayed
It was originally #NUMBER#.
I won't call it anyway
I won't eat it
I will definitely complain
Why didn’t you say it earlier if you couldn’t deliver it?
Waiting for you for so long
No, I haven't received a call
Please ask him to send it to our company again
I don't want to wait #NUMBER# more minutes
A meal waited for an hour and a half

I want to cancel the order
Why not cancel it?
Hi, the chicken sent by the restaurant is raw
I want to try tennis, but I'm afraid I won't be able to stick with it, so I want to try a similar price first.
They are not friendly. In fact, the price is often directly proportional to the degree of friendliness. If you cannot distinguish, then the expensive ones are normally more friendly than the cheap ones. These "entry-level rackets" are actually industrial garbage.
They are very low in intensity, when the ball hits the racket there is a lot of vibration, the hard ball cannot withstand it, and it is difficult for experts to control.
Their logic and subtext are as follows: tennis is so difficult, we know that you won't be able to learn it, and we also know that you won't be willing to buy an expensive racket, so we will give you a cheap racket to fool you, and you will not play again after playing twice. This way, the racket is cheap, and you won't feel sorry about it.
When you can really tell the difference between good and bad, it means you've improved, and then you can come back here to buy the more expensive ones, and I'll make twice the money.
It is recommended to buy a second-hand racket that is a bit better for a similar price. Choose Prince or Dunlop. These two brands are not famous enough, so the good rackets are not sold at a high price. A new racket for 500 to 600 yuan is very good. A second-hand racket for 200 yuan. Isn't it nice to enjoy what a thousand-yuan racket has to offer?
It's very friendly to beginners, but once past the beginner stage, it's useless, but most people, especially girls, can't get past the beginner stage.
The order has been repeatedly delayed.
May I ask if you could follow up on this?
Postponed
Thank you
That is to say, I already have credit?
Do I need to place a new order? Do I need to ignore the previous order?

In fact, there are many things to pay attention to when dressing and matching for slightly fat girls.
Girls with fat bodies should not wear skirts that are too short or too long, and the length should be around the knees, just enough to cover the fat part of the thighs.
If the skirt is too short, it will reveal the fat on the legs.
If it's too long, it will make you look short and fat.
If you wear a top, skirt and long stockings in different colors, it will create a slimming effect and make you look taller.
In fact, many dark-colored clothes are the standard for slightly chubby girls (the author has a deep understanding of this), and dark colors are also a good way to hide the fat on your body. The elegant and noble black skirt is also the first choice for slightly chubby girls.
Wearing dark-coloured clothing, especially black short skirts, will make you look slimmer.
If you have chunky calves, don't wear socks or shoes that draw attention to them.
The more popular, the better, and the colors should not be too bright.
In order not to make people feel fat when they pay attention to your legs and feet.
For slightly chubby girls, it is necessary to talk about the tricks of dressing and matching.
Micro-fat girls must not wear tight short skirts. In addition, the tops must not be too short or tucked into the skirt, which will make people feel very uncomfortable. If the legs are thick, you should wear black over-the-knee stockings or grid stockings (the kind with fine grids), and choose a soft, printed trumpet skirt and match it with a V-neck top, which can effectively conceal the shortcomings of fat girls.
Of course, there are some things to keep in mind when a slightly chubby girl wears a short skirt.
If you are a fat girl wearing a short skirt, you should choose a top with the same color as the short skirt. This will make you look tall.
Short skirts matched with high heels can make your legs look more slender, which is the most fashionable combination in summer!
If you are a girl with a fat upper body and thin legs, it is recommended to choose a gorgeous one-piece short skirt.
Not only can it cover your big belly, but it can also show your advantages.
An A-line skirt is very slimming, and is more suitable for fat girls. The top should be chosen to be a little tighter to create a sense of layering, which will be more slimming.
A simple white T-shirt paired with a short skirt can also be tried by fat girls.
Girls with a little fat can also wear a sense of fashion.
As long as you can master the rules of dressing and matching, the slightly fat girls will also be the focus of everyone's attention.
After making changes in the way you dress, you should also exercise more in daily life to get rid of the label of being a slightly chubby girl as soon as possible. 😄

Xinhua All Media+ | The Beijing Youth Ice Hockey League Fanned the Winter Olympic Enthusiasm - Xinhua Net
On December 11, Beijing Dream Team player Pang Yaotian (in the middle) took a shot in the game.
On that day, the Beijing Youth Ice Hockey Club League of the 2021-2022 season continued to compete at major ice rinks in Beijing.
This league is divided into the regular season and the post-season. The age range of the participating athletes is from U6 to U18, and the group setting is divided into competition group and selection group, attracting nearly 3600 players from 256 representative teams in the city to participate.

The girl used herself as target to raise money for her sister: "I feel better when I think it's just a flesh wound" - Xinhua News
A girl stood in front of a large wooden board in Wulin Square, Hangzhou. The words "Human Target, Ten Yuan per Arrow" were written on the wooden board.
Yesterday morning, a photo of “a Hangzhou girl willing to be a ‘target’ to raise funds for her sister” swept the Moments.
The photo shows a girl standing in front of a wooden board slightly taller than a person at Wulin Square in Hangzhou, with the words "human target, 10 yuan for an arrow" written on the board, indicating that passers-by can pay to use a bow and arrow to shoot.
This behavior aroused heated discussion among netizens.
Last night, the propaganda officer of the Xiacheng Branch of Hangzhou City Public Security Bureau confirmed to a Beijing News reporter that the police confirmed that the girl made such an extreme move because her sister was raising funds. However, this kind of behavior is not worthy of encouragement. After being warned, the girl left the local police station yesterday.
Girl's street "target" charity appeal warned
The photos circulating on the Internet show that a girl with long hair is standing in front of a large wooden board in a "person" shape. The words "human target, RMB 10 per arrow" are written in black ink on the wooden board. On another wooden board in front of her, her bank account and WeChat and Alipay accounts were written.
The photo has since sparked controversy online.
Some netizens believe that this is "begging for attention", and many netizens expressed their sympathy.
"We discovered the situation around 10 a.m. on the 23rd when we were patrolling by the square. At that time, there were already many onlookers. "
A police officer from Tianshui Police Station near the scene said in an interview with local media that there were two girls selling things, both about 20 years old and dressed in a youthful and beautiful way.
Among them, the girl who was "human target" has been crying, asking passersby to play this game; another girl on the side helped to shout, saying that her friend's sister had leukemia and urgently needed surgery fees, asking everyone to help.
"We contacted the local police in Guizhou and learned that the girl was raising funds for her sister's leukemia treatment. "
Last night, the publicity director of Hangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau Xiacheng Sub-bureau told The Beijing News reporter that the girl’s name was Jijiali, and she was fundraising for her elder sister Jijian.
But because the treatment still needs more than 300,000 yuan, he could not think of a good way to fundraise, so he did this.
He said that during the whole process, one of the two girls was the target, and the other was responsible for assisting, but did not participate. During the whole process, no one was found to shoot arrows, but some people watched and took pictures and posted them on Weibo.
Later, the police identified that the bow and arrows used were not subject to control by the public security department.
The official said that "we do not advocate this kind of eye-catching fundraising."
She had already left the police station after being warned by a police officer.

I bought it for my nephew. I originally wanted to wait for the 418 bank activities, but he needed it urgently, so I bought it in advance, so I didn't make it to the big activities of the bank, which is a bit regretful.
However, the cost performance is quite high, and the logistics is also quite fast. I'll come back to comment after using it for a period of time.

What was the hottest thing in 2021?
Without a doubt, it is the Tokyo Olympic Games.
Do you think that only Olympic athletes can win awards?
Recently, an article titled "Check it out! Project managers can compete for the gold medal in the Olympics" was very popular. It mentioned that project managers can definitely take the lead in many projects, and no one can match them: moving bricks, business trips, and staying up late are the daily routines of project managers. Firefighting, shouldering the blame, and apologizing are all in a day's work.
The article, which seems to be a joke, actually reveals the daily bitterness of project managers. It represents the powerlessness of current project management work.
People engaged in project management have also gradually chosen to take some actions to extricate themselves from the difficulties in their work.
Judging from the year-on-year increase in the number of PMP (international certified project management professional qualification) applicants, more and more project management practitioners are improving their project management capabilities through learning.
According to the 20 Years Development Report of Project Management in China (1999-2019), as of September 2019, the cumulative number of PMP® applicants in the country was nearly 600,000, the number of people who passed the PMP® certification was about 420,000, and the number of valid certificate holders was about 300,000, accounting for 31.2% of the global total of PMP® certificate holders.
Over the past 10 years, the number of PMP holders has increased year by year, which indicates that more and more project managers have realized that it is no longer advisable to rely on the "old experience" in the past. The rapidly changing working environment makes us realize that one should learn to stand on the shoulders of scientific giants to explore the way forward.
However, does passing the PMP guarantee a smooth project management experience?
Many project management beginners said that they can systemically grasp the related knowledge points such as the ten knowledge areas and five process groups of project management by learning related courses such as PMP/IPMP, but they are still at a loss when they really do project management work.
Many project managers often report the following problems: lack of project management cognition, relying solely on personal experience, having project management theory but not knowing how to put it into practice; lack of systematic project management process system support, unable to put it into practice in work, project estimation is not accurate, control sensitivity is poor, project is delayed again and again; unclear division of labor among members, the "old hands" in the team do not know how to deal with it; cross-departmental assistance and communication are not smooth, and it is difficult to promote the project...
Therefore, focusing on product innovation and R&D management for more than ten years, it has already helped many excellent enterprises cultivate a large number of product managers, project managers and other R&D key talents, and won the honorary title of "China's Enterprise R&D Management Talent Training Demonstration Base". Zhongtian Huaxia Consulting brought the online course of "R&D Project Manager Special Training Camp".
The online course of "Research and Development Project Manager Special Training Camp" is an online fragmented learning method. It combines the practical cases, tools and methods of many R&D enterprises to help you master the necessary knowledge and standard actions of project managers, and walk on the path of advanced project management.
This is also an opportunity for enterprises to use lower cost and less investment to promote the training process of project managers and bring efficient operation results for enterprises.
Mere words are not enough, so you can first look at what other students think about this course: This course is not only taught by the Zhongtian Huaxia expert team (the original Huawei R&D management team), but also combines the international advanced project management method and the real business scenario of many well-known companies to provide in-depth and professional explanation of the course content.
It will also provide scientific and practical management tools and methods, as well as a wealth of template forms to help students apply what they have learned in class to their specific work.

Before the 12.12, ZTE advocates rational consumption to consumers - Economic Observer - A professional financial news website
This year's "Double Eleven" carnival nationwide network payment business transactions reached 1770 billion yuan, setting a new high compared with previous years.
A variety of full-price-off red envelopes and attention-grabbing live-streaming e-commerce once again made consumers exclaim that they had benefited from it. This consumption craze, on the one hand, made people marvel at the increasingly strong consumption power of the nation, and on the other hand, it was necessary to calm down and think about the impact of consumerism on society and the contemporary mainstream consumer groups.
On the eve of the “Double 12”, Jietong Consumer Finance Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as "Jietong") issued a call for rational consumption, reminding the general public, especially young people, to establish a good consumption consciousness and consumption habits, and reject blind consumption and over-consumption.
According to the results of the "Consumer Financial Literacy Survey Analysis Report" released by the People's Bank of China this year, the national consumer financial literacy index is 66.81, an increase of 2.04 compared with 2019.
Overall, the performance of our residents in financial consumption is good, but there are great differences in financial behavior and skills, and it is still necessary to further improve the level of basic financial knowledge.
The financial literacy level of the elderly and young people is relatively low, and the "old and young" will continue to be the focus of financial education; Nielsen's "China Young People's Debt Situation Report" and CCTV Finance's "2019-2020 China Youth Consumption Report" show that young people have huge consumption potential, and credit consumption has become an important way to upgrade consumption. 86.6% of young people are using credit products, and nearly half of them do not have debt accumulation. Although the younger generation as a whole tends to consume rationally, which is quite different from the label of "over-spending" attached to them by the outside world, some young people do indeed engage in over-consumption and follow-the-crowd consumption, and thereby created large financial pressure and debt risks, and even led to a gradual increase in social problems. Financial enterprises should be brave to take on social responsibility and provide positive guidance.
As a licensed consumer finance institution, Home Credit has always been committed to providing high-quality and caring services to help people build their own happy lives, advocating consumers to establish a good and correct consumption concept, and actively respond to regulatory calls to enhance the rational consumption awareness of consumers, especially young people, with practical actions.
Over the past few years, CITIC has been constantly carrying out all-round and diverse financial knowledge popularization activities for young groups, including university students, and has subtly guided the consumption needs of the young group through various forms, such as innovation and practice competitions in cooperation with top domestic universities, to help them establish a rational consumption concept, plan their consumption needs reasonably, and thus help them accumulate life wealth.
As Double 12 approaches, Home Credit reminds all consumer friends to establish a reasonable consumption consciousness and correct view of money, resist blind consumption and over-consumption, and avoid the pitfalls of consumer loans, so as not to affect personal credit and future economic life.
When consuming, you must plan in advance, act according to your means, and repay on time.
If overdue, the overdue record will be recorded in the personal credit report, which may have a negative impact on economic life, such as buying a car or buying a house in the future.
At the same time, when enjoying financial products and services, you should also choose regular institutions and channels, and pay attention to check whether the relevant institutions have business qualifications.
In the future, Home Credit will continue to rely on its mature and reliable consumer finance system and continuously updated and iterated financial products, to provide consumers with more demand-oriented and diversified services, and to continue to help the general public to improve their financial knowledge, help consumers develop the concept of rational consumption and moderate borrowing, and become a trustworthy consumer finance partner for consumers.

Vietnam Net - The Gulf Cooperation Council responds to common challenges
Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's stops include Oman, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, Bahrain and Kuwait.
It is worth noting that this is the first visit to Qatar by Crown Prince Mohammed since Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies imposed a ban on Qatar in mid-2017, which led to the Gulf diplomatic crisis.
In this crisis, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt severed diplomatic relations with Qatar and imposed a comprehensive embargo, accusing Qatar of supporting terrorist organizations and having close relations with Iran.
Diplomatic tension has seriously affected the internal unity of the Gulf Cooperation Council and had a negative impact on the economy of countries in the region.
Four Arab countries have blocked all land, sea and air routes to Qatar.
The crisis was only resolved in January 2021 at the Gulf Cooperation Council summit, when Gulf states signed an agreement towards "unity and stability" mediated by the United States and Kuwait.
Saudi Arabia has reopened its border with Qatar.
Saudi Arabia and Egypt are making efforts to restore relations with Qatar by appointing new ambassadors to the country.
The Gulf Arab states resolved their differences to restore relations with Qatar out of necessity to work together for the benefit of their countries and regional stability, to address common challenges.
During the visit to Oman by the Saudi Crown Prince, the two sides agreed to open the first direct land channel between the two Gulf countries.
The 725-kilometer-long corridor connecting the two countries will provide convenient conditions for the travel of citizens of the two countries and the integration of supply chains.
The Saudi Public Investment Fund (PIF) will invest $5 billion in Oman, and the two countries' enterprises signed 13 memoranda of cooperation worth $30 billion.
The Saudi crown prince's visit to the Gulf countries comes as Iran and world powers are in talks to save the 2015 Iran nuclear deal known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), which Arab Gulf states have condemned for not addressing Iran's missile program.
The Gulf states have always regarded Iran as a long-term "competitor" and regarded Iran's nuclear program as a "threat" to regional security.
Gulf states believe that it is flawed not to solve the Iranian missile issue and not to take action to contain Iran's activities in the region.
Under the background that the nuclear negotiations between major countries and Iran failed to meet the wishes of various Gulf countries, Saudi Arabia conducted direct negotiations with Iran.
Its aim is to contain the escalation of tensions in the region.
This is one of the factors behind the slowdown in economic growth in the Gulf Cooperation Council countries.
The upcoming GCC summit will be the first GCC summit since the end of the dispute between some member states and Qatar.
This is an opportunity for the Gulf Cooperation Council to reassess its diplomatic achievements in promoting the restoration of the Gulf Cooperation Council’s unity, while proposing a series of measures for its member states to fully cooperate to address common challenges and contribute to the stability and development of the Gulf states.

It is said to be the loudest supercar exhaust in Xinshan District!
This time, our team brought this car to you, which is the dream of many men!
It is the flagship supercar of Lamborghini, the Murcielago's successor — Aventador LP700-4!
The asking price is close to two million ringgits, the annual road tax is several thousand ringgits, and it is four-wheel drive. Why is it called LP700?
With 700 horsepower, can you imagine how fast that is?
Forget it, I don't know. The data says it only takes 2.9 seconds to accelerate from 0 to 100 km/h, which is probably when my Myvi reaches 30 km/h, they have already reached 100 km/h, well.
The low body, the arrogant scissor door, the huge air intake all over the body, and the 6.5 v12 engine that can be seen through the glass, perfectly interpret the style of Lamborghini.
There's no need to say too much about the car model. Just Google it. The editor has compiled some explanations that Google may not provide!
Too much attention, wherever I go everyone is looking at me, it's very uncomfortable! (Actually, it's kind of cool.)
RM1 for 1km (car owners don't care at all)
Practice getting in and out of it or you'll end up a bit embarrassed (because you won't be able to climb out and will get stuck halfway out)
The engine is so loud that you'll go deaf as soon as you get out of the car. (But it's still a lot of fun.)
The body is too large, and it will be very narrow to park in a normal parking space. I am afraid of being hit by the door of the next car when it is opened!
A little lonely, because there was no opponent on the road (I said it myself, it has nothing to do with the car owner, haha)
Don't misunderstand, the supercar in this video is not for sale, sorry!
Friends who want to shoot videos for their beloved cars are welcome to contact us!

Let the university spirit resonate with the spirit of the times - Xinhua News Agency
The so-called university spirit refers to a series of education concepts and value pursuits formed in the long-term accumulation in the development process of a university, which is the soul of a university.
From ancient times to the present, the university spirit has been of vital importance to the development of politics, economy, culture, science and technology, and society, as well as the progress of a nation.
Since the birth of the world's first modern university, universities have shouldered a unique mission different from other social organizations. For Chinese universities, which were born in the autumn of national crisis, their spirit is deeply influenced by traditional culture and the changes of the times. They advocate the value concept of “cultivating virtue to benefit the world, and governing in peace” and the patriotic responsibility of “promoting education to strengthen the nation”.
At present, the trend of informatization and internationalization of higher education is becoming increasingly obvious. The global education competition, science and technology competition, and talent competition are intensifying. As an important “supply side”, the structural reform of higher education is facing unprecedented opportunities and challenges.
In particular, the proposal of the Overall Plan for the Construction of World-Class Universities and First-Class Disciplines, in addition to showing China's confidence and determination to move from a major higher education country to a strong higher education country, has also put forward higher and more updated requirements for the development of universities.
How to make efforts to become a world-class university in a short period of time, and to speed up the construction of several world-class universities and a number of world-class disciplines on the basis of still having certain gaps, so as to achieve "overtaking on a curve"?
In addition to having confidence in goals, paths, and abilities, universities should also make full use of three advantages: first, latecomer advantage, by continuously introducing overseas outstanding academic talents and learning from the advanced experience of world-class universities to achieve significant improvement in academic levels and quality of education; second, cultural advantage, by inheriting the wisdom content of five thousand years of Chinese civilization and promoting the development of excellent traditional culture to gather strength, shape brands, and enhance images; third, institutional advantage, by making full use of the institutional superiority of socialist countries, strengthening target-driven efforts, gathering consensus and strength, optimizing resource allocation, and providing a sustainable and solid guarantee for schools to catch up with world advanced levels.
It is particularly important to realize that the construction of world-class universities cannot be a one-size-fits-all approach, and each school must show its individuality and characteristics while playing to its strengths.
The educational characteristics should not only have the common Chinese characteristics, but also reflect their unique goals, educational traditions and resource endowments.
As for Zhejiang University, we focus on three aspects in our education: First, we focus on the characteristics of cultivating innovative and entrepreneurial talents, build an integrated educational environment of science and education integration and school-enterprise cooperation, and form a full-chain entrepreneurial education ecosystem; second, we focus on the characteristics of cross-disciplinary aggregation, promote the optimization and adjustment of the discipline system, create a cross-disciplinary institutional environment, and actively cultivate emerging cross-disciplinary disciplines and landmark cross-disciplinary achievements; third, we focus on the characteristics of education system and social service, carry out in-depth international exchanges and cooperation, and speed up the formation of Pan-Zhejiang University industry-university-research cooperation system.
In this process, it is particularly important to always adhere to the university spirit and make the university spirit resonate with the spirit of the times.
For Zhejiang University, the school motto of "Seeking Truth and Innovation", the common values of "Diligence, Morality, Discernment, and Diligence" and the common expression system of the Zhejiang University spirit of "Embracing the Yangtze River and the Huaihe River, Enlightening and Thickening Virtue, Opening the World and the People, and Building Our Country".
This is an important guarantee for the school to adhere to the correct educational direction, continuously accumulate cultural height and concentrate spiritual strength. It is rich in connotation and profound in meaning.
Among them, "Hai Na Jiang He" emphasizes the spirit of openness and inclusiveness, embodies the spirit of "using the talents of the world", and is manifested in the absorption of the high-quality concept of education and education from world-class universities; "Qi Zhen Hou De" emphasizes the spirit of seeking truth and goodness, which refers to the university's pursuit of truth, while it should also accept the cultivation of virtue and the sharpening of personality; "Kai Wu Qian Min" reflects the spirit of reform and innovation, which not only includes the pursuit of new knowledge and the innovation of scientific research, but also reflects reform and development, and the transformation of the old for the new; "Shu Wo Bang Guo" emphasizes the spirit of patriotism and dedication, and talks about the university should always share the glory and disgrace with the fate of the nation.
This series of spiritual concepts and value pursuits is exactly the soul of Zhejiang University's 120 years of education.
"The wise hear in silence, and the enlightened see before it takes shape."
Chinese universities should further take root in the overall cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics, deeply grasp the era position and historical mission of higher education, and accelerate the construction of world-class universities.
At the same time, it adheres to humanistic care and independence and freedom, allowing the university spirit to collide with the spirit of the times and the national spirit, so as to provide an inexhaustible impetus for the realization of national prosperity and national rejuvenation and the common ideal of mankind.

At the same time, Ouyang Yu expressed his most sincere blessings to the graduates and their parents, and also expressed his heartfelt respect to the dedicated and academically excellent teaching staff of the university.
During the reading of Professor Liu Zunyi's commendation by Professor Sun Yifeng, professor of the Humanities Institute of Australia, Professor Liu Zunyi is a world-renowned economist who is known for his outstanding academic achievements and forward-looking educational ideas.
In addition to his achievements in economic development, economic growth and the East Asian economy, he is also a far-sighted education leader.
In short, he has made great achievements in many fields.
When Sun Yifeng read the eulogy of Professor Shuji Nakamura, he said that Professor Nakamura was a pioneer in sustainable energy technology.

When NFTs are quickly out of the circle, a new concept has emerged in the encryption community.
In 2021, a blockchain game called "Axie Infinity" had a huge impact in Southeast Asia. Some residents who lost their jobs due to the epidemic began to obtain stable income in this game.
"Axie Infinity" is a pet raising game based on blockchain technology, which combines multiple play styles including NFT, and is currently the highest trading volume NFT project, which has exceeded 3 billion US dollars.
According to TokenTerminal data, Axie Infinity's daily income exceeds $8.2 million, which is close to Honor of Kings.
On August 6 this year, the official of Axie Infinity announced that its daily active users had exceeded 1 million.
The popularity of "Axie Infinity" will bring a new "palytoearn" model to more people. With the help of blockchain and smart contracts, players are no longer a single role. They can not only get pleasure and economic benefits from the game, but also participate in the governance of the game ecosystem.
This autonomy is not granted by the game developer, but is guaranteed by blockchain technology.
When I saw a piece of news about the stock price of a friend, my biggest feeling is the choice of enterprises in the race, that is, the choice of industries for investment targets. First of all, choose industries with large growth space, at least 100 billion market size; secondly, choose industries with good future growth, consider industries that will reach the best state of industry growth after 3-5 years; thirdly, choose industries with policy support.
The width of the track refers to the market size, the length of the track refers to the development stage of the industry, and whether the track is flat or rugged refers to the competitive pattern of the industry.
Go the right track!
In the new year, the first thing to do is to sum up 2021 and adjust the tactical layout for 2022.
Strategy is all about "doing the right things", that is, doing things right.
And the strategy is "do the right thing", that is to do the right thing.
Strategy is about finding direction, and tactics are about landing. There is room for strategic thinking above most tactical thinking.
For example, on top of how to increase the number of customers (tactical thinking), you can think about whether to continue to deepen in the current field or extend to other fields (strategic thinking); on top of improving the customer retention rate (tactical thinking), you can think about how to improve the retention rate of core customers and high-value customers (strategic thinking); on top of increasing event participation (tactical thinking), you can consider how to set the right event KPIs to achieve the right event goals, such as increasing the participation of target customers, activating high-value silent customers, and accurately acquiring new customers; on top of increasing DAU (tactical thinking), you can consider whether the current growth is healthy and sustainable.
After 12 years of birth, Bitcoin welcomed several milestone events in 2021.
On September 7, El Salvador, a small country in Central America, made bitcoin legal tender, which was the first time that bitcoin became the legal tender of a country or region.
On October 12, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the launch of a Bitcoin ETF by ProShares for the first time in eight years, and listed it on the New York Stock Exchange. This marked the landing of the first regulatory Bitcoin futures ETF in the U.S. capital market, and the further expansion of the exposure to cryptocurrency investment.
From the perspective of the development of blockchain technology, Bitcoin is not the protagonist.
On November 14, 2021, Bitcoin conducted a soft fork upgrade named "Taproot," which increased the anonymity of transactions in the Bitcoin network and reduced the data burden in transactions by changing the data structure of the block itself.

U.S. Asian-American groups complain of admission discrimination at 3 Ivy League schools including Yale - Xinhua News Agency
Xinhua News Agency, Washington, May 23 (Reporter Xu Jianmei) More than 130 Asian-American groups in the United States submitted complaints to the U.S. Department of Education and the Department of Justice on the 23rd, protesting that three Ivy League schools - Yale University, Brown University and Dartmouth College - discriminated against Asian-American applicants in the admission process.
The Asian Education Alliance, which initiated the complaint, held a press conference in Washington that day.
At the press conference, Zhao Yukun, chairman of the group, said that in the past 10 years, the number of Asian applicants who meet the admission requirements of American top universities has doubled, but the proportion of Asians in these three American top universities has basically remained at the same level.
Many studies have shown that these universities "systematically and continuously discriminate against Asian applicants" in the so-called "comprehensive consideration" admission process.
Zhao Yukun introduced that in 2014, the research of Sanders and other scholars showed that among the three universities, Asians had the lowest admission rate among all ethnic groups relative to the number of applicants.
Data from the U.S. Department of Education also shows that Brown University and Dartmouth College have the lowest admission rates for Asian students among all the Ivy League schools, and Yale University and Brown University have implemented de facto racial quotas on Asian applicants for more than 20 years.
Zhao Yukun told Xinhua News Agency reporters that they hoped that the U.S. Department of Education and the Department of Justice would conduct investigations and take measures to stop these universities from continuing to discriminate against Asians in admissions after determining the facts.
They also hope that the universities being complained about will actively pay attention to this issue, and change their admission policies for Asian students.
At present, the three universities that have been complained about have not responded.
The Asian American Education Alliance was established in 2015. At that time, it filed a complaint against Harvard University for admission discrimination, but the U.S. Department of Education did not accept the complaint for procedural reasons.
In addition to the Chinese-American group participating in the complaint, there are also Indian-American, Korean-American, Japanese-American, and Pakistani-American education groups.

In September 2020, Mr. Lu learned about a factory in Zhangting Town, Yuyao, Zhejiang from a real estate agent. After visiting the site several times, Mr. Lu decided to purchase the factory.
In December of the same year, Mr. Lu discussed the details of the purchase of the factory and the house owner’s relative, Mr. Lin, and paid a deposit of RMB 200,000 through bank transfer on the same day.
Lin signed as the payee in the "Factory Purchase Deposit Receipt", which stated, "If the buyer does not want to buy this factory, the deposit will be returned to the seller. If the seller does not want to sell this factory, the deposit will be doubled and returned to the seller. Both parties agreed to sign the factory purchase contract within a week."
However, after that, the two sides failed to reach a consensus on the main terms of the contract, such as the scope of the factory sale and payment method, and the house purchase contract could not be signed.
Considering that the two sides failed to reach a consensus on the contract content, several days later, Mr. Lin returned the 200,000 yuan deposit to Mr. Lu.
After much effort, Mr. Lu paid the down payment and was ready to pay for the house, but just before signing the contract, the seller decided not to sell the house, which left Mr. Lu feeling helpless and angry.
To this end, Mr. Lu sued Mr. Lin to the People's Court of Yuyao City.
After hearing, the court believed that the two parties eventually failed to sign a formal contract and could not solely blame the defendant. It should be reasonably presumed that the negotiation failed. Therefore, the case should not apply the deposit penalty and the defendant should not bear the breach of contract liability of double return of the deposit.
After the first trial, the plaintiff filed an appeal.
Recently, the court of second instance upheld the original verdict.
[Reminder from lawyers] It is necessary to exercise due caution during the transaction process.
When signing the contract, as the buyer, it is necessary to exercise due care, such as verifying the information of the owner of the house, whether the house is occupied by others, and specifying the specific time and place of delivery in the contract to prevent disputes between the two parties when fulfilling the contract.
(Deutsche Welle Chinese Network) After the end of the "Democracy Summit" on Friday, the spokesperson of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement on Saturday (December 11), saying that the United States holding the "Summit for Democracy" was "to draw the line of ideology, to instrumentalize and weaponize democracy, to practice anti-democracy in the name of democracy, to incite division and confrontation, and to divert domestic contradictions".
The Chinese government believes that "for a long time, the United States has imposed its political system and value concepts on others, promoted 'democratic transformation', abused unilateral sanctions, and instigated 'color revolutions', resulting in disastrous consequences.
"Democracy" has long been the "weapon of mass destruction" used by the United States to interfere in other countries.
The summit was an action by Biden to fulfill his campaign promise.
The two-day meeting was held via video, and the leaders of 111 countries around the world were invited to participate, including the leaders of Taiwan, but China and Russia were not invited.
On the eve of the summit, China and Russia criticized the United States for its own democratic problems, saying that the United States was not qualified to host such a summit.
There are also voices of doubt in the international community and in the United States. For example, some leaders with authoritarian tendencies were invited to participate, such as the leaders of the Philippines, Poland and Brazil. Some people doubted that the true intention of the Biden administration was not for democracy but for geopolitics to organize this summit.
The newly appointed German Chancellor Scholz also attended the video democracy summit.
A statement from the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Saturday said that "Today's American-style democracy is in a state of decay, with problems such as money politics, identity politics, partisan opposition, political polarization, social fragmentation, racial conflicts, and widening wealth gap becoming more and more serious," and that the democracy in the United States is a "rich man's game" established on the basis of capital.
U.S. President Biden said in his speech that, "As leaders of the government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen the fence of democracy, promote reform, achieve transparent accountability governance, and resist the force of the buffer and impact of authoritarianism, as well as those who want to pursue power nakedly before the public interest. "
He emphasized that democracy is not taken for granted, "We must constantly renew it in every generation. In my view, this is the decisive challenge of our era. "
Biden also said that democracy needs fighters to defend it "at a time when global democracy and human rights face persistent and concerning challenges. "
The U.S. side promised that after this democracy summit, it will launch a one-year action, including a $4.244 billion initiative to strengthen democracy around the world and support independent news media.
The United States hopes that all countries will make specific and public commitments to improve their democratic system before the physical democracy summit planned to be held at the end of 2022.
Biden said, "Let our nations all implement our commitments and report on our progress next year."
Well, I'm just worried that he sent it to the wrong address

The clay pot rice has just the right amount of dryness and wetness. The portion is very generous. The signature foil-wrapped chicken wings are as good as always. The soup of the day is also good. The Chinese broccoli is also well-prepared...

How do you drink Red Label whisky?
Everyone has different hobbies. Some people like to collect things, some people like food, and some people like to drink. Red Label whisky is one of the best-selling Scotch whiskies in various countries, and Red Label whisky has won a gold medal in the International Spirits Competition.
Each bottle of Red Label has a unique taste, but if you don't know how to taste it, it would be a waste of its fragrance.
So, how to drink Red Label whisky?
Here is a brief introduction by the editor.
How to drink Red Label whisky:
The Johnnie Walker Red Label whisky is a blend of about 35 different Scotch whiskies. It has a strong aroma and the traditional characteristics of Scotch whisky. The strong aroma has a sweet and smoky flavor.
The entrance is rich and fresh, with a hint of mint and a strong taste of smoked malt.
The wine can be enjoyed on its own with ice, or mixed with your favourite drink.
Red label whisky has entered the domestic market. In order to meet the taste of Chinese people, red label whisky + cola or Sprite or other sparkling drinks has become an enduring fashion.
These sweet beverages can not only neutralize the sourness and bring visual enjoyment, but also add to the drink to dilute the alcohol taste and change the mouthfeel.
Red Label whisky + a slice of lemon + rock sugar (white sugar can also be used) is the most authentic and traditional way to drink it.
The authentic red vermouth has a slightly sour taste. Adding sugar can neutralize the sour taste, and the lemon will bring a refreshing fragrance to the wine. Of course, the sweetness and sourness can be adjusted according to individual taste preferences.
The above three are the best ways to drink red label whisky. You can try them as a reference. I hope my introduction can help you.
Educational thought: How can university entrance examinations benefit both "top students" and "underachievers"? - Xinhua Net
Three students from Lanzhou Jiaotong University wrote a letter to the school leaders, reflecting their confusion about the university examination and proposing to increase the difficulty of the examination, change the examination questions, and let the examination truly reflect the actual level of the students.
Indeed, for a long time, university entrance examinations have been a "hot topic" .
In the university campus, students come from all over the country and have different abilities. In addition, they have different learning levels, so their learning situations are very different.
Assessment of a group with such diverse characteristics will always be subject to different perceptions.
Of course, if the questions in the exam are of a single type and have a high repetition rate, and the questions are too simple, it will inevitably lead to a completely different feeling.
For students who do not study hard, they may be able to pass the exam by cramming before the exam. If they want to try other methods, they may be able to achieve twice the result with half the effort.
As a result, there is the "strange phenomenon" that the "bad students" can pass the exam without any effort and even get high scores; the "good students" never miss a class, have excellent homework and notes, but don't score much higher in the exam.
In this regard, the problems reflected by the Lanzhou Jiaotong University students in the university examinations are not groundless, and it is believed that this situation does not only exist in Lanzhou Jiaotong University.
From this point of view, we should applaud the three students who wrote to express their opinions.
In fact, those who have attended university are well aware that it is not uncommon for students to cram for exams, try various means to "extract" test questions from teachers, and strive to narrow the scope of the exam in order to get "key tutoring" before the exam. In addition, it is not uncommon for students to carry cheat sheets during the exam and ask teachers for leniency after the exam.
In my opinion, as a teaching quality assessment guide, whether a university's examination is passed or not depends more on the teacher's comprehensive grasp of teaching and learning, and the scientific question setting based on this.
Entering the university undergraduate stage, the major begins to be subdivided, and many professional courses are mainly based on basic knowledge.
There is no doubt that whether or not the basic knowledge points of a discipline are fully grasped is the content to be examined in university examinations.
On the other hand, undergraduate knowledge is basically the basic theory and basic common sense of the discipline. In terms of knowledge points, there is not much room for change, and it is basically fixed.
As one teacher said, "The basic knowledge of university mathematics 20 years ago is still being learned now, and it is still the focus."
However, the knowledge points are basically the same, which does not mean that the examination question types are single and the questions are repeated.
In many universities, exams are usually composed of a question-setting group, and then coordinated by senior teachers of the subject to form a test paper. The exam marking is also participated by all teachers in charge of the subject, which can to a certain extent overcome the situation of repeated questions.
However, in order to compile a set of test questions that are in line with the actual teaching and learning situation, the difficulty of the questions should follow a normal distribution based on the overall learning situation of the students. This requires a comprehensive understanding of the teaching situation and a comprehensive analysis of the learning level of the students, so that the examination questions can have a dynamic grasp of difficulty and question types. This can not only focus on the examination of basic knowledge, but also take into account the examination of ability, and at the same time carry out innovative design for the question types.
The exam is the baton of university education. If there is such an exam, students will have corresponding preparation plans. In the long run, it will affect the effectiveness of university education.
The Lanzhou Jiaotong University attaches great importance to the suggestion letter from the students, and has deployed the rectification plan in the whole school.
It requires each teaching unit to organize teachers to conduct discussions and self-inspection of the final course examination, formulate the examination paper setting and related system, and strengthen the supervision and inspection of the examination paper setting and review, refine the score assessment, and strengthen the comprehensive assessment of all aspects of the course teaching.
Solving the problems of single types of questions and repeated questions from the perspective of mechanism is an issue that needs to be faced by the university examination administration. Of course, it is necessary to formulate corresponding systems, but the key is in daily efforts. Teachers need to have a comprehensive grasp of the teaching situation. Not only should they have a thorough understanding of the teaching content, but they should also have a thorough understanding of the students' learning situation. With a thorough understanding at both ends, teaching and learning will be better connected and form a positive interaction. The examination will also be more in line with the actual situation, so that the "top student" and the "poor student" can get what they need.
If it is not possible to change the location of the branch for me, can it be delivered instead?
Then I don't have to give you any more money, do I?
My colleague's order has already been delivered.
It can't be completed.
What about GPS?
Mrs. Jin's Bridal Photography (South Street Store) does not currently have a branch.
Before taking pictures, we changed the time twice because we didn’t plan our time well. Consultant Lan Lan was very patient and helped us arrange the time.
Later, I chose a weekend with good weather to take the photos.
The staff of Mrs. Jin, whether it is a consultant, a make-up artist or a photographer, is very good.
That was the first time I've ever done my makeup properly in my life, wow, I can't believe that one day I would look so good, haha.
Xiaojie and another girl (I'm sorry, I can't remember her name) were super patient when doing our makeup, and the makeup was very natural.
The outdoor scenes were filmed in Jiangwan City. Fortunately, the weather was good that day, and we didn’t feel very cold. The makeup artist would pay attention to our clothes and headwear from time to time, and immediately help us to adjust them if anything was slightly out of place.
The photographer was also very humorous, and I felt very happy after taking pictures all day.
When choosing photos, I was reluctant to let customers delete too many photos because I saw many cases online. However, when we were choosing photos, there was no intention to let us add photos. The 24 photos in the package were not added at all. (I heard that my cousin, who took wedding photos around the same time as me, added more than 10,000 photos to her package that was already more than 7,000, which really shocked me. I was also very afraid that I would choose too many.)
Today, the photos were fixed. Lan Lan sent them to me. I looked at two of them and felt that they were not good. They immediately helped me to fix them again.
I flipped through my sister's old photos and compared them. I think our photos are really satisfying. They are simple and fresh, just the style I wanted.
I sincerely recommend everyone to take wedding photos in Xuanhan Jin Furen!
Package price: RMB 3,999
Mrs. Jin is grateful for your sincere wishes for her happiness and a bright future!

3,200 newborn babies in Sabah do not have birth certificates due to the shortage of anti-counterfeiting paper
(Kuala Lumpur, 11th) The Sabah National Registration Department said that since the beginning of October, due to the lack of special anti-counterfeiting paper, it has been unable to issue birth certificates to newborn babies, and the number of affected people has accumulated to 3200.
However, the director of the bureau, Kairuaminus, assured that the information of all babies who have already applied for birth certificates has been recorded in the system, and will be re-issued when the anti-counterfeiting paper is delivered next week.
He explained at the press conference, in response to an online media outlet’s report on the problem of Sabah newspapers being printed on newsprint for as long as 10 months.
He said the issue arose two months ago and Sarawak is also facing the same problem.
"One of the reasons is that the Chinese factory producing special anti-counterfeiting paper is affected by the epidemic, resulting in delayed arrival in our country. "
He explained that the anti-counterfeiting paper used in Sabah birth certificates is different from that used in other areas, so it cannot be borrowed from other states.
Khairul Amni revealed that the latest batch of anti-counterfeiting paper had arrived in Kuala Lumpur on the 6th of this month and was handed over to the printing company on the 8th for part of the printing work.
"The department will send staff to pick up the goods in Kuala Lumpur next Thursday, return to Sabah for the final stage of printing immediately, and it is estimated that it will be handed over to the applicant within 2 working days (December 20). "
"We will notify the applicant to go to the local police station to collect the birth certificate. "
He added that Sabah has issued a total of 24,801 birth certificates so far this year.
from 7 o'clock until now
Is it almost here?

It's super convenient, just like opening it on a computer, and it solved my problem of insufficient computer hard disk.
The newly arrived solid-state mobile hard disk cannot be read by the computer, and the computer does not recognize the mobile solid-state hard disk, while the computer can read the U disk.
The robot is very light, and the appearance is atmospheric and beautiful.
After using it for a whole afternoon today, the heat dissipation is very good, and I can hardly feel that it is hot. The running speed is very fast, and it starts to kill 99% of users.

**It doesn't feel big, it feels heavy, it's not actually that big in one hand, it's just a little bit bigger than 15.6 inches, and it runs very stably, and it doesn't feel like it's lagging. I love the sound of the fan's heat dissipation. It has a sense of feeling, and it doesn't turn all the time like a gaming laptop.

Education Information: Beijing Compresses the Proportion of Special Talents in Middle School Admissions in 2016 - Xinhua Net
On the 21st and 22nd, the entrance examination for middle school students with special talents in Beijing was organized and implemented by each district education commission.
This year, Beijing’s districts all reduced the enrollment ratio for students with special talents, making the competition for students with special talents even more intense.
Take Dongcheng District as an example. This year, the proportion of primary school students admitted to middle schools in Dongcheng District does not exceed 5% of the total enrollment plan of the district. The planned enrollment is 380, and the arrival rate does not exceed 10% of the school's enrollment plan.
All students who have sports, arts, or technology talents and have registered online are eligible to participate in the enrollment examination for students with special talents.
In order to facilitate students to participate in the examination nearby, Dongcheng District continues the examination arrangement method of last year, setting up 1 to 2 examination sites in each school district, with a total of 13 examination sites.
The examination points are divided according to the examination areas, and the time periods are divided by the hour. On the day of the examination, students will enter the examination points according to the time periods and take the examination in the examination rooms of different examination areas.
On May 23, the Education and Examination Center of the District published the list of students who passed the examination online. Students can check the results of the examination online.

President of the Bosnia and Herzegovina Olympic Committee: Believe that China has the ability to hold a successful Winter Olympic Games in a special period - Xinhua News Agency
Xinhua News Agency, Sarajevo, December 11 - The President of the Olympic Committee of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kvesic, recently said that the Bosnian side is very much looking forward to the Beijing Winter Olympics, and firmly believes that China has the ability to hold a successful Winter Olympic Games during this special period.
Recently, the Chinese Ambassador to Bosnia and Herzegovina, Ji Ping, met with the Chairman of the Olympic Committee of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kvesic, at the Olympic Center in Sarajevo.
During the meeting, Kvesic spoke highly of Sino-Bosnia relations and said that he visited China at the time of the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics. He was deeply impressed by the excellent organization of the Chinese side. He believes that China has the ability to host the Winter Olympics in special times. The Bosnian side is very much looking forward to the Beijing Winter Olympics. The Olympic Committee of Bosnia and Herzegovina is actively organizing participation. The Bosnian side hopes to use this opportunity to carry out more extensive exchanges and cooperation with the Chinese side in the field of sports.
Ji Ping said that there is a special "Olympic bond" between China and Poland.
The 1984 Sarajevo Winter Olympics were successfully held here, and two months later, the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics will also open, presenting a simple, safe, and wonderful event to the world.
We look forward to deepening exchanges and cooperation between the two countries in the preparation for winter sports events and athlete training. The Chinese Embassy in Bosnia and Herzegovina is willing to continue to play the role of a bridge, take the Beijing Winter Olympics as an opportunity to promote the continuous deepening of people-to-people exchanges between the two countries, and let the people of the two countries “move towards the future” together. We wish the Bosnian and Herzegovinian athletes to achieve good results in Beijing.
Before the meeting, the Bosnia and Herzegovina Olympic Committee held the 10th annual best athlete award ceremony. Qi Ping was invited to present the award to the best young athlete of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The promotion video of the Beijing Winter Olympics was played in a loop at the scene of the event.

48-hour nucleic acid negative, setting up a "buffer zone" The Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism of the State Council issued a document to strengthen epidemic prevention and control in port cities - Xinhua Net
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 11 (Reporters Dong Ruifeng and Gu Tiancheng) - The State Council's joint prevention and control mechanism recently issued a notice on strengthening the prevention and control of COVID-19 in port cities, requiring that people who have recently left land border port cities (except those connected to Hong Kong and Macao) must hold a 48-hour negative nucleic acid test certificate, and those going to land border port cities must undergo at least one nucleic acid test after arrival.
According to the notice, the time frame for the above requirements is from the date on which each province, autonomous region and municipality determine and announce the scope of port cities to March 15, 2022.
In addition, the notice also states that port cities with conditions can study the setting up of epidemic prevention and control buffer zones within their jurisdiction.
An official from the National Health and Family Planning Commission’s Bureau of Disease Prevention and Control introduced that for some port cities, cross-border trade is the main economic pillar of the region, and there are frequent exchanges between border residents on both sides.
Implement a policy of regional differentiated management, from one line of defense against the overflow to two lines of defense, which is expected to achieve the goal of moving the checkpoints forward, compress the risk of epidemic overflow, and achieve the maximum effect of epidemic prevention and control with the minimum social impact and the lowest social cost.
Recently, there have been a number of local cluster outbreaks in China, all of which were imported through port cities from overseas epidemics.
The above notice pointed out that this exposed some problems, including untimely epidemic monitoring and warning in some places, non-implementation of closed-loop management for personnel in high-risk posts, regular nucleic acid testing being perfunctory, cold-chain items not being disinfected at each stage, centralized isolation places not being managed in a standardized manner, and emergency response to the epidemic not being scientific and precise enough.
The notice required efforts in nine aspects, including improving the epidemic prevention and control mechanism of port cities, perfecting the epidemic monitoring and early warning system, and implementing border control measures, to speed up the replenishment of port city’s prevention and control shortcomings, do prevention and control work without letup, scientifically and accurately, and weave a dense and firm external prevention and control line.
The notice emphasized that each port city should carry out epidemic prevention and control and livelihood protection work at the same time, publish and open a hotline for livelihood protection, and regularly check for potential risks in the supply and price of basic living materials, and promptly solve and actively respond to prominent issues reflected by the masses.
According to the notice, the port cities referred to include the counties (cities, districts, banners) where the open land, water and air ports are located, the cities (prefectures, states, leagues) where they are located and the municipalities directly under the Central Government. The specific scope will be determined and announced in a timely manner by each province (autonomous region, municipality directly under the Central Government) according to the needs of epidemic prevention and control.

Oil tube video exposes the truth of the US military's 20-year bloodthirsty killing - Xinhua Net
(Video Source: YouTube)
On December 11, a micro-documentary entitled "Killing Machine" on the YouTube platform attracted widespread attention.
The film tells the story of the United States waging war in Afghanistan in the name of "anti-terrorism", forcibly exporting American-style democracy through war, 20 years of military spending, bloodthirsty, indiscriminate killings, and committing all kinds of crimes against humanity.
Abuse of unmanned aerial vehicles to attack hospitals, schools, and other civilian sites, distorting human nature, and establishing a murder squad.
In the past 20 years, the U.S. military has killed tens of thousands of innocent Afghan civilians.
The U.S. military set up a "black prison" to torture "suspects" and humiliate them.
A series of crimes against humanity has aroused the hatred of more Afghans.
As the video said, the American "anti-terrorism" war is "the more it opposes, the more it is afraid."
War has not brought peace, democracy, or prosperity to the people of Afghanistan. All it has brought is a country in ruins and countless killings and destruction.
Click on the video, and let's expose the truth of American bloodthirsty killings in the name of "anti-terrorism", and expose the hypocrisy of American democracy!
I happened to see the following article, which talks about why this customer wants a logistics company inside the bonded area to do canning from a business perspective and from the perspective of shelf life. Although canning belongs to deep processing and is not within the scope of business of the bonded logistics company, the following text may explain why the customer wants to do so?
I went to many milk powder factories and came into contact with many milk powder production lines.
In fact, the powdered milk in bags and in cans has the same raw materials, and there is no difference between them.
Then everyone will certainly ask: Why is the shelf life of bagged food one year, while the shelf life of canned food is two years or longer?
Or ask: Why is there such a big price difference between listening and bagging?
In fact, from this point of view, many consumers or mothers think that this is because the raw materials are different, so the quality will be much better.
Actually, the raw materials are the same, but people think that the more expensive it is, the better it is.
There are also consumers who ate it with this kind of attitude and said that the taste or flavor is different after eating it!
Now, I will first talk to you about the reason for the high cost of hearing aids. Why are they so expensive?
Why are their raw materials the same, but the price is so different?
Because most of the manufacturers take into account that if the price of the bag is too high, it will be difficult for the consumer to accept, which means that the profit generated by the manufacturer is very low, or even no profit. Then, what do the manufacturers rely on to survive?
Therefore, they had a large increase in the price of the hearing aids to ensure their profit space.
Therefore, most manufacturers promote listening to the installation rather than the bag.
Moreover, the annual advertising expenses of so many manufacturers are tens of millions or even hundreds of millions. Where does this fee come from?
Needless to say.
As society develops, the cost of market promotion, such as: the cost of promotional staff in shopping malls, the cost of display in shopping malls, the cost of gifts for products, and the cost of advertising, are all constantly increasing.
Therefore, various manufacturers are also constantly increasing new products, and they are listening and installing, and their prices are also constantly rising. In fact, these are new products that come out with the increase of market costs.
The main purpose is to obtain higher profits. In fact, the cost increase of their raw materials will not exceed 3 or 4 yuan at most.
There are also some brands that, in order to promote their products, resort to any means necessary, hook up with doctors in hospitals, and have them assist in the promotion of the products. They make profits ranging from 30 yuan to 80 yuan for every product sold.
China’s relevant laws absolutely do not allow such operation methods, and in fact, this practice is harming consumers.
If you have a can at home, it is recommended that you buy powdered milk in bags and put it into the can. This can save money and increase the preservation and sealability of the milk powder, without any impact on young children.
Also, don’t think that the shelf life of bags is longer than that of bags. If the shelf life of bags and bags is the same after opening, it is just that bags are difficult to save after opening and are prone to moisture and spoilage.
The delivery was late, the food was all cold, and it became dry and hard after it was cold, and it was completely inedible.

Don’t scare people at the starting line - Xinhua News Agency
When you visit the book market, you can often feel the popularity of success books.
Many of today's self-help books promote the "best principles" -- that is, to first assume or imply that you can "do it," and then tell you what it is you need to "do."
It is equivalent to skipping the most important and fundamental step of "how to do it".
It is for this reason that these books share a common feature - either go all out and do your best, or do nothing at all; either it's 100, or it's 0; either you climb Mount Tai, or you just stay where you are.
This "best principle" is so "right" that anyone can see it, but 99% of people will be intimidated at the starting line.
Because this theory advocates a path of "you have to make up your mind and make a 180-degree change", which is exactly the fatal weakness of many people.
For those who are set in their ways, follow the old ways, and refuse to change, you are shouting "You need to change" in their ears. This is undoubtedly self-deception and playing the lute to a cow.
Most people will be shy in front of the word "change" and hesitate to make a decision, or make a "change" decision on a whim, and bravely take the first step, but often the good times do not last long, and they are defeated in a short time, and it is difficult to continue.
Mr. Ma Sanli’s famous “From Tomorrow Onward” skit is the best classic portrayal of this “universal human nature”.
The biggest problem with the "best principle" is that the threshold is too high. It often exceeds the limits of ordinary people's abilities, making the vast majority of people "sigh at the door".
Perhaps, the "second-best principle" is the only way for more ordinary people to walk on the path of relative success.
The core of the "Good Enough Principle" is "lowering the threshold" - it advocates the theory of "accumulating small victories to win big victories", that is, if you can't do 100, just do 1: because 1 is always greater than 0; if you can't climb Mount Tai, just climb the little sand dune in front of your door: because that is better than standing still.
In short, it’s always better to do something than to do nothing.
Due to the significant reduction in barriers, there is now more possibility for ordinary people to persist, and the probability of success will also increase if you persist in anything.
However, the path to success by following the "second-best principle" is slightly longer.
All in all, the "best principle" may sound like it is for everyone's success, but in fact, it can only motivate a few people. The "second best principle" can effectively motivate more people and benefit as many people as possible.

The resources of naked carp in Qinghai Lake have increased by 0.71 thousand tons this year - Xinhua Net
Xining, December 11 (Reporters Luo Xiaofei and Zhang Hongxiang, Xinhua News Agency) According to reporters from the Qinghai Provincial Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, the latest monitoring results show that the reserves of naked carp in Qinghai Lake have increased by 7,100 tons this year compared with last year, reaching 108,500 tons, which is more than 40 times that in the early stage of protection in 2002.
Qinghai Lake naked carp, also known as "Huang fish", is a unique and precious fish species in Qinghai Lake, which plays a crucial role in ensuring the safety and biodiversity of the "water-fish-bird" ecological chain in the Qinghai Lake Basin.
In the 1960s and 1970s, under the influence of factors such as large-scale hunting by humans and the continuous deterioration of the breeding environment of naked carp, the number of naked carp in Qinghai Lake decreased sharply, and the resource reserves of naked carp in Qinghai Lake were only 2,592 tons in 2002.
In 2004, Qinghai Lake naked carp was listed as an endangered species in the "China Species Red Book".
Since 2003, Qinghai Province has implemented lake closure and fish breeding, and prohibited any units, collectives and individuals from catching naked carp in Qinghai Lake and the main rivers and tributaries in the lake area, and prohibited the sale of naked carp and its products.
At the same time, through artificial breeding and release, as well as clearing the main river channels of Qinghai Lake and designing scientific and reasonable "fish passageways", the protection efforts have been continuously increased, and the amount of Qinghai Lake naked carp resources has increased year by year.
Yang Lin, deputy director of the Qinghai Provincial Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, introduced that, as of now, a total of nearly 180 million naked carp have been implemented for artificial breeding and release, contributing more than 23% to the recovery of naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake.
The Sanjiangyuan Region of Qinghai is an important ecological barrier and water source conservation area in China and even in Asia, and Qinghai Lake is a natural barrier and an ecological function zone that controls the spread of desertification in the west to the east.
In order to protect the ecological environment of the Sanjiangyuan region and Qinghai Lake, protect aquatic wild animals, and maintain the biodiversity of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, Qinghai has successively issued fishing ban notices for key waters of the Yangtze River, Yellow River, and Qinghai Lake this year. It has established a "one river, one river, one lake" comprehensive fishing ban management system.

But it is not so regular that it can be accurately predicted, with a tolerance of about a week, so it is necessary to be prepared in advance. Sometimes, bad luck will cause it to fail (suddenly advance a few days in advance).
The length of time, the amount of blood, and the severity of cramps vary from person to person. Some people have it for three days, some people have it for a week. Some people have light flow, some people have heavy bleeding. Some people have no reaction, some people have pain so bad they need an ambulance. Dysmenorrhea can change over time - just because you didn't have it before doesn't mean you won't have it for the rest of your life.
Menstruation is out of control. For days from beginning to end, there is 24-hour bleeding, and all that can be done is to use sanitary pads or sanitary cotton to suck up the blood to prevent it from flowing onto clothes or chairs.
Dysmenorrhea is mainly due to the secretion of prostaglandins. Take ibuprofen as soon as possible at the beginning of the menstrual period to effectively alleviate the pain of that month. It is useless to take it after the pain has started.
Before the period, due to the congestion of the uterus and the excessive release of prostaglandins, it is easy to have diarrhea.
If it's about time for your cycle, and you get sudden diarrhea, your period will usually start within two days.
Sanitary pads should be changed every two or three hours, otherwise it is easy to breed bacteria. Excluding sleep time, the worst case is six changes a day, seven days a month, which is 42 pieces, and if you include the extra pieces prepared in advance, there may be 50 pieces, which is not one piece a month.
(Here's a change, the sanitary pad does not need to be changed frequently, it can be changed every five or six hours, and it can be changed every eight hours at most.)
Hormones during the menstrual period may cause more irritability, and the ovulation period may also cause emotional instability due to changes in hormones in the body, which is very unfortunate, and the body gives you trouble.
However, the official crime rate data shows that women have a very high ability to control their emotions, and will not use emotional issues as an excuse.
The flow isn't just blood; it includes shed uterine lining.
The endometrium is at its thinnest after menstruation and slowly thickens, which can be understood as the uterus being a house, building a house each month (the endometrium thickens) in preparation for a guest, and if the guest does not arrive, it is all taken down (menstrual discharge) and a new house is built the following month, and so on and so forth.
Menstruation is very inconvenient. For decades, a few days each month for 24 hours a day, with stomach and back pain, who would like it?
However, people are born because their mothers had a period, and a period is to prepare the 10-month-long house you will live in when you first come into this world, so everyone should thank their mothers for having a regular and healthy period.
A lot of women's things have been suppressed in the past, and society has brainwashed women that it's dirty, it's shameful, that's just the way it is, but times have changed.
If anyone finds menstruation disgusting or finds the preparation of the female body for the creation of life disgusting, they should not speak out in public. Girls, stand up and stop thinking this way. Men who have never experienced it, will never experience it, and don't know much about it, should not be so ungrateful and ignorant. How can they face their own mothers with such an attitude? How can they want their own children?
Finally, sisters, try sanitary napkins, which are really useful.

Is the foot bath causing numbness in the feet due to electrical leakage?
Choosing a suitable foot bath can have a good foot massage and health care effect. Today, the Guomei editor will answer this question. I hope it will be helpful to friends.
As people's awareness of health care has increased, foot basins have become more and more popular with consumers, and a large number of products of different grades have emerged in the market, from more than 100 yuan to thousands of yuan. There is a wide range of choices for consumers.
According to the relevant data, compared with traditional home appliances, the sales of health-care home appliances such as foot bathtubs are booming, but there are no specific industry standards for foot bathtubs, so there are certain safety risks.
"Soaking your feet in charged water is really dangerous!"
Mr. Li told the reporter that recently, he bought a foot bath for his father as a birthday gift, but his father felt numbness in his feet when he was soaking his feet.
At first, Mr. Li thought it was due to the vibration function of the foot bath. Unexpectedly, after turning off the vibration function, his father still felt numbness in the soles of his feet.
When Mr. Li tested it with an electric pen, the electric pen actually lit up, and Mr. Li was surprised to find that the water in the foot bath was actually electrified.
Later, he contacted the merchant, and the merchant's attitude was not bad, although he returned the foot bath, Mr. Li still felt uncomfortable.
Because he found that the foot bath, which has been popular for a long time, has no clear and detailed industry standards in terms of the maximum temperature setting, the people it is suitable for, and the materials that ensure it is harmless.
However, under normal circumstances, the foot bath will not have the problem of electricity, but it is not ruled out that some products are not strictly inspected when they leave the factory.
Therefore, when buying, choose a separate foot bath.
The separation of water and electricity is completely safe.
At the same time, you can take the electric pen at will.
The 13th Provincial Tea Expo Opens - Headlines - Hunan Daily Net - Huasheng Online
Hunan Daily, December 10th (All-Media Reporter Zhang Shangwu, Hu Panpan, Correspondent Liu Xiaoling, Photographer Li Jian) - This morning, the 13th Hunan Tea Industry Expo and New Hu Red Tea Promotion was held at the Hunan International Convention and Exhibition Center, showing the tea industry, innovating tea technology, promoting tea culture, and accelerating the rush to the trillion-yuan tea industry goal.
The opening ceremony was attended by Hou Shunli, Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors of the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives, and Ye Hongzhuan, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Provincial People's Congress.
In the opening ceremony, Professor Liu Zhonghua, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, made a solemn recommendation: the origin of lake red is new in Xinhua, and the rise of red tea will inject new vitality into the "colorful Hunan tea".
In recent years, the provincial party committee and provincial government have strongly supported the development of the tea industry and promoted the construction of the 100 billion yuan Xiang tea industry, forming a development pattern of "three Xiang, four waters and colorful tea".
The tea industry in the province has increased innovation, with green tea, black tea, red tea, and other main types of tea taking turns to exert their strength. The major tea-producing areas are promoting the integration of tea and tourism, and driving a large number of tea farmers to increase their income.
Fengshui turns, and red tea comes into play again.
Experts in the tea industry in the province said that after harvesting green tea, red tea, and black tea, tea farmers have income throughout the year, and the output value of tea gardens is on the rise.
At the opening ceremony, the provincial leaders awarded the fourth batch of enterprises with the right to use the "Hunan Red Tea" trademark, and Xinxing was happy to hold the "Hunan Red Tea Source".
At the Xinhua Red Tea Exhibition Hall, Fujian tea merchants were attracted by a kind of high mountain tea called "Ice Spring" and placed an order on the spot.
Wang Zhun, the Secretary-General of the Provincial Tea Industry Association, said happily that the current epidemic and other factors have more or less affected the tea market, but from the scene of the tea fair, there are many highlights.
New-style red tea is a touch of red, which injects the connotation of tea culture. The popularity is strong and the transaction is hot, and the Hunan tea industry welcomes a new spring.
If the food isn't hot, can it be cancelled?

Metaphysics is the study of questions that cannot be directly answered by perception through the use of rational reasoning and logic.
Metaphysics is the fundamental principle of philosophy, aiming to explain the basic nature of existence and the world.
The Chinese name "Metaphysics" is derived from the phrase "形而上者谓之道，形而下者谓之器" in "系辞上传" of the "I Ching", which was translated by Inoue Tetsujiro, a Japanese scholar in the Meiji era.
Branches of metaphysics include ontology, natural theology, and related issues.
Ontology is "the study of which nouns represent real existing things and which nouns just represent concepts."
Metaphysical naturalism refers to the denial of the existence of God.
Its theoretical basis holds that all phenomena can be explained by the concept of natural reason, proposed by philosophers who support science and the theory of evolution.
Methodological naturalism, on the other hand, refers to a method of research that is silent on God.
Mind philosophy is a branch of philosophy that studies the nature of consciousness and its relationship with the body (especially the brain).
Dualism and monism are the two main schools of thought in discussing the "relationship between the mind and the body".
Epistemology is a branch of philosophy that investigates the nature, origin, and scope of knowledge.
Ethics is the systematic study of human moral life; here, morality is defined as the set of behavioral norms recognized by a group of people or a culture.
Mainly divided into metaethics (abstractly studying the essence of ethical theory or criticism) and normative ethics (evaluating various different moral views, and giving moral guidance for right or wrong behavior.
It studies what style of moral behavior people should follow (normative ethics), applied ethics (the academic study of applying ethical theories to real-life situations, including bioethics, political ethics, etc.), and descriptive ethics (collecting information about how people actually live, making generalizations from observed patterns).
It does not start from an expected theory of ethics, but instead investigates the actual moral choices made by actual moral agents, and all of the ethical factors that led to those choices, and studies the moral views held by social groups.
The history of ethics includes Greek and Roman ethics, medieval Christian ethics.
The first part is the ethical thought of humanism, represented by Valla and Montaigne.
The second part is the ethical thought of the Reformation, represented by Calvin.
The third part is the ethics of politics, represented by Machiavelli and others, modern ethics (17-18th century, British empiricism ethics, representative figures: Hume and others, 17-18th century, European rationalism ethics, representative figures: Spinoza and others, 18th century, French enlightenment ethics, representative figures: Voltaire and others, 18-19th century, German school ethics, representative figures: Kant and Hegel and others, 18-19th century, British utilitarian ethics, representative figures: Bentham and Sidgwick and others, 19th century, British evolutionary ethics, representative figures: Spencer and Huxley and others, late 19th century, German neo-Kantian ethics, representative figures: Rickert and others, late 19th century, neo-Hegelian ethics, representative figures: Thomas Hill Green and others), and the ethics of the transitional period (non-rationalist ethics, representative figures: Kierkegaard, Schopenhauer, and Nietzsche and others).
Logic is the study of "the principles and standards of valid inference and proof."
Logic usually includes three parts: inductive reasoning, abductive reasoning and deductive reasoning, which can be divided into formal logic and informal logic.
Aesthetics is a discipline that studies the nature and meaning of beauty.

Known as a "mystery genius" in the industry due to the publication of the "Exotic Code" series such as "Strange News from Thailand," "Strange News from India," "Strange News from Japan," and "Strange News from Korea," he claims to "be good at talking nonsense with a straight face."
"Under the Lamplight", also known as "Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio", "suspense genius" Yang Xing uses his new work "Under the Lamplight" to take you deep into the marrow of Chinese folk customs.

Ding Zilin: To a friend.
I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to all friends for the humanitarian assistance given to us during the long 30 years since the death of our relatives. Especially since the beginning of 1994, when I personally issued a call for humanitarian assistance to friends at home and abroad, the assistance has never been interrupted until now.
Nowadays, most of the parents of the victims have passed away, and the children have grown up, married and employed.
It is your kind deeds that have helped us through the most difficult moments.
At present, the new coronavirus is raging around the world, and most of the donors have already retired.
Therefore, I earnestly request that you stop the humanitarian donations to us - the Tiananmen Mothers group. This humanitarian aid activity should have come to a perfect end a long time ago.
I will always remember your kindness, and I believe your good deeds will be remembered by history.
For various reasons, I can only express my will in this way. Please understand, my friends!
Please accept my sincere congratulations.
Tao Ye said: "Please allow me to take this opportunity to briefly introduce the 32-year history of the International Federation of Chinese Students and Scholars (IFCSS) and the Minnesota China Democracy Foundation (MCDF) engaged in humanitarian assistance.
In the process of humanitarian assistance, the All-America Student Union and the Minnesota China Democracy Foundation are two parallel organizations, and the project implementers often overlap.

Aid money often fails to reach the hands of the June 4th victims.
In 1994, according to Mr. Ding's suggestion, the “Tiananmen Mothers” established a special group to coordinate and take charge of receiving and distributing the relief funds.
In 1998, MCDF established the "June 4th Orphans Education Fund," and after 11 years of implementation, in 2009, after all the June 4th orphans had graduated from college, MCDF established the "June 4th Orphans and Destitute Elderly Special Assistance Fund," which has continued to be implemented to this day.
The funds for these projects are mainly from the campus and social donations in the year of June 4, the generous donations from individuals, and the support from the Democracy Foundation of the brother universities.
Since 2018, it has also received support from the Laogai Research Foundation.
Until last year, after 31 years, the victims of June 4 finally received part of the donations raised in the name of June 4 in Hong Kong.
During this time, China Human Rights was also independently carrying out its humanitarian relief projects.
We understand that Mr. Ding stopped the June 4 donations for the consideration of the donors. We are all retired elderly people, and our incomes are not as abundant as they were before retirement. Therefore, we express our gratitude for Mr. Ding's “Letter to Friends”.
We will respect the decision of the asylum-seekers and terminate the project within two years, and resume it immediately when needed.
At the same time, we would like to express our gratitude and respect to those courageous fellows who have been donating generously and taking risks to deliver humanitarian aid over the years.

Thanks for the comments from the rabbit. I originally said that the ancient style is not suitable for the ancient style, but I did not expect the finished product to be so beautiful.
Thank you, Dan Dan, for your recognition. Your satisfaction will give us the energy to move forward. We will continue to work hard!
This photo studio is amazing, I highly recommend it to everyone!
From the reception, makeup, clothing, lighting, photography to the post-production, everything is impeccable.
The make-up artist is particularly meticulous and will match the make-up according to your style. The cosmetics used are also top brands.
There is no need to say more about Teacher Tian Liang; his photography is very professional.
The whole studio has an artistic atmosphere, and there are two kittens to play with.
We work in Beijing, and the better photo studios in Beijing need to be booked six months in advance. A colleague had photos taken in Beijing, and after looking at the finished product, thought they were just so-so.
I specifically looked for this studio, a place with soul and attitude.
Our facial expression management is poor, and we think this is also the shortcoming of most people. Photographer Liangge will capture and record the natural and wonderful moments.
The makeup, the photography, the post-production design, a great team.
When it came out, we and the people around us all praised it.
I've already recommended it to my best friend, and she was also very happy after seeing the negatives.
I hope that such a studio will not be buried, and that more people will discover it and make their own style, rather than all the same.
I would like to thank Zhan Ying and Jing Ling for their five-star comments. Both of them are very creative newcomers. We are a creative studio. As long as the customers like it, we will do our best to complete it. We are grateful to meet each other.
The sweet and considerate assistant, as well as the lively and cheerful photography teacher, everyone in the team is super nice. It was a wonderful photo shoot. It was an unforgettable experience, and the results were much better than I expected. Everyone worked hard, and I am very grateful to you all. 😘😘
Thank you, Xiao Yu, for your comments. Meeting you is also a kind of fate. From Hohhot to Qinhuangdao, your trust in us is a journey of thousands of kilometers. I am very happy to meet you. If there is a chance, I will come to Qinhuangdao again next time.

A programming newbie who wants to share his personal experience.
If you intend to enter this industry, you can choose to go to a place for training, but if you have no such idea, it is better to learn by yourself. After all, the cost of training is very high, and it takes six months to learn.
However, if you are planning to enter this industry, training is indeed a very good choice, especially for those who are extremely weak in self-discipline, training is a very good choice.
If you have strong self-control, you can choose self-study, but it will be more tiring.
Of course, choosing a good training institution is very important.
First of all, we should look at the teaching staff of this institution. If the teaching staff is not strong enough, then this training institution is meaningless. Of course, the teaching staff of some newly established training institutions is not particularly strong.
Secondly, before choosing, inquire about the training institution, it is best to inquire about the students of this institution, after all, only the students of the institution know what the institution is like, and whether the courses taught are good or not.
Hi, actually, I don’t know how to answer your question, because I don’t know your situation. Learning this thing has a lot to do with one’s own situation.
For example, your profession, age, the language you want to learn, and even the city you're in are all related to the industry you're studying or want to work in.
If you are a student and have not yet graduated, or if you are a computer science graduate, I would personally recommend self-study if you have enough time. This is the most efficient and cost-effective method. Nowadays, many offline and online training institutions are actually quite good, but they are costly to attend and require a lot of time, usually concentrated training for 3-6 months.
However, if it is the case I mentioned, self-study is very convenient. Now, many learning resources on the Internet are free, or you can find many training resources on b station. If you don't know how to find resources, you can also contact me through the introduction to get free resources or detailed consultation.
In addition, there are some more classic books that can be combined with videos for comprehensive learning.
If you are not a computer science major, but you can also pay a certain amount of learning money and time cost, it is recommended to study in a training institution, so that learning is not very difficult, the teacher's explanation is also very detailed, there are people to answer questions specifically, and there is help in learning planning or supervision.
And now many training institutions will sign employment agreements and have referral quotas. After learning, they will recommend going to the company, which can save a lot of things in the interview later.
Here are some of my thoughts. I didn't introduce it in detail because I didn't know your situation. If you have other questions, you can contact me at any time for exchange and communication.
I said I'll be there before 1 o'clock, I saw it on the app
What is
I haven't finished speaking, what are you doing?
I accept all kinds of (installation, cleaning, maintenance), wall-mounted boilers, water heaters, water purifiers, washing machines, air conditioners, toilets, stoves, range hoods, light fittings, glass cleaning, professional caulking, and housekeeping services.
Thank you to those who gave me a like in silence. For the sake of life, I will continue to struggle. Life is tiring, but I must go on.
Life will not disappoint every hard-working person. If you like it, please pay attention to me. Thanks to those who like me silently.
Life is like this. Others only look at the results, but we bear the process alone. In the face of life, apart from being strong, we can only continue. There is no other choice. The road can be looked back, but cannot be turned back...
Cleaning is both a job and a responsibility. Life is made beautiful by service, and service is made wonderful by sincerity.
Although cleaning is the dirtiest job, we will use the most serious attitude to clean every corner of the customer's home. The moment we see the customer's satisfied smile and thumbs up, all the hard work is worth it. There is always a reward for our efforts!
My daily work
"Your request, my service."
Serve with heart, clean with heart, and keep the beauty.
The details you care about, Fenggui Housekeeping helps you to achieve "clean" as much as I can, and serve your home with love.
Keep the Wan family clean, build a monument to household management, and serve to the end, and keep it clean at home.
Indoor and outdoor cleaning, my daily work
Although crystal lights are gorgeous, they will become dim if they are not cleaned for a long time. Only after cleaning can they shine. This is the same for life.
Only by putting your heart into it can you succeed. Only by being meticulous can you create refinement. We take tile grouting seriously.
Give me a chance, I will definitely make you satisfied, quality speaks for itself, because professionalism deserves to be trusted. Your recognition is my greatest encouragement!
It’s hard to do anything these days!
But I always believe that as long as I am serious, persistent and hard-working, I will be better than others, at least it's better than sitting and complaining!"
A day's plan lies in the morning. All the good things begin in the early morning. I hope that you will start a new day with happiness, luck, health, and wishes, and keep a good mood all day long. Good morning.
When we were young, happiness was a thing, and we were happy when we had it. When we grew up, happiness was a goal, and we were happy when we achieved it. When we became mature, we realized that happiness was actually a state of mind, and we were happy when we understood it.
Be the most authentic and kindest self, follow your heart, and have no regrets in this life; there is only one path in life, walk your own path; there are two treasures in life: good body and good mood, live a beautiful life until old age!
Every stage of life has different challenges.
Many times, what is holding you back is not ability, but the courage to face it positively.
Since we cannot avoid it, we might as well face it frankly.
The more you fear, the more you will be defeated by difficulties; the more you face challenges, the more problems will be solved.
Chinese and Saudi curators work together to hold Saudi Arabia's first contemporary art biennale-Xinhua News Agency
RIYADH, Dec. 12 (Xinhua) -- The first contemporary art biennial in Saudi Arabia - the Diriyah Contemporary Art Biennale - was officially open to the public on the 11th in the Diriyah JAX Art District northwest of the Saudi capital Riyadh. A total of 64 artists from Saudi Arabia, China and other places participated in the exhibition.
The biennale is co-curated by the Saudi Diriyah Biennale Foundation and the UCCA Ullens Center for Contemporary Art in China, with Tian Feiyue, director of the UCCA Ullens Center for Contemporary Art in China, serving as artistic director.
According to the curatorial team, the theme of this biennial is "crossing the river by feeling the stones", which is a metaphor for the reform strategy adopted during the period of social and economic transition, and also reflects the current situation of Saudi society and cultural development.
This biennale covers an area of nearly 12,000 square meters, with exhibition halls spanning six interconnected buildings and presented in six units: "Crossing the River by Feeling the Stones," "Tradition as Experiment," "Marginal Thinking," "Engaging the Public," "Brave New World," and "On the Spirit of Art."
Among them, the works of 27 Saudi artists account for more than 40% of the total exhibits, covering painting, installation art and performance art, etc. The works of 12 Chinese artists also received much attention. Some artists used recycled materials in a new way for creation. For example, Xu Bing used waste to reconstruct a classic landscape painting in "The Story Behind Series: Endless Streams and Mountains" (2014).
Buckley, CEO of the Diriyah Biennale Foundation, said that he hoped that this Biennale would establish an international dialogue, allowing the global audience to have the opportunity to understand Saudi Arabia’s thriving cultural industry and creative community, and strengthen interactive exchanges.
Tian Feiyue said, "The goal of the biennale is two-fold: to allow Saudi contemporary art to participate in the global dialogue, and to allow Saudi audiences to integrate into the world of contemporary art. "
It is understood that a series of lectures will also be held during the opening week of the Biennale. Artists, curators and opinion leaders in the creative industries will discuss topics such as cross-cultural exchange and the development of contemporary art.

Yunnan: Coordinating and standardizing the management of rural public welfare posts - Xinhua Net
Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, December 12 (Reporter Lin Bifeng) - In order to continue to do a good job in employment assistance for people lifted out of poverty and consolidate and expand the achievements of poverty alleviation, Yunnan Province has recently introduced relevant policies to promote the management of rural revitalization and rural public welfare posts to help comprehensively promote rural revitalization.
The relevant person in charge of the Yunnan Provincial Human Resources and Social Security Bureau introduced that at present, Yunnan has developed 448,300 rural public welfare positions, which are used to settle employment for rural difficult groups such as rural labor force that has been lifted out of poverty, and play an important role in helping the poverty-stricken people achieve employment and income increase, consolidating the achievements of poverty alleviation, and effectively improving the various public services in rural areas.
This new regulation was jointly issued by seven departments including the Yunnan Human Resources and Social Security, Rural Revitalization, and Finance. It mainly unifies and standardizes the scope of objects, fund management, post development, post management and other aspects of the recruitment of rural public welfare personnel at the grassroots level.
In terms of job development setting, the new regulations clearly stated that it should be set according to the principles of "setting jobs according to needs, assigning people according to jobs, dynamically managing, and controlling the total amount" and "who develops, who uses, and who is responsible" and "one person, one job, voluntary open, and unified management".
The recruitment process must be carried out according to the following steps: announcement, application, review, publication, employment, pre-job training, and arrangement for going on duty.
In addition, the new regulations also clarified the specific duties of the main development departments of rural public welfare posts, the subsidy standards and payment methods of rural public welfare posts, and stipulated that each rural public welfare post development department should purchase accidental injury commercial insurance for rural public welfare post placement personnel; required relevant departments to regularly supervise the payment of subsidies for rural public welfare posts.

Hello
Can I cancel the order?
I re-ordered
Whether it has been cancelled
Second, although the right has had its heyday in history, it is not long, so it is short because it is brilliant with a bit of sunshine and sweaty with a sip of boiled water; if it gets a little bit of success, it will long for more; if it is hit, it will attach itself to anyone.
In fact, the right-wing has played a positive role in the process of social progress.
From the end of the Cultural Revolution to define the standard of truth, the development of the economy, the improvement of science and technology and the promotion of political institutionalization and human rights protection, the positive significance of the right should not be denied.
Thirdly, as far as I am concerned, although I do not completely agree with some of Li Weidong’s views, I take his views seriously and respect Li Weidong as a person; because he is serious, he is serious about China, and he takes China’s social problems seriously.
But I disagree with his anti-communist theory. I believe that an anti-revolution is necessary, and a revolution will inevitably lead to social unrest, damage to people’s livelihood, a mess of political groups, and foreign countries taking advantage of the situation.
Fourth, to change or improve China, one must be patient and have a responsible attitude towards the country and its people. Political opportunists trying to pull chestnuts out of the fire are not rightists; they are scoundrels.
Let's talk about Zuo again.
The left, in fact, is a group of people who have been abandoned by the times and politics.
If the right has a positive meaning for the society, the Communist Party will listen to some right-wing opinions and analyze their thoughts when needed. However, the left has no such good fortune, because what the left wants is precisely the dregs thrown away by the Communist Party!
Fifth, recently, I have seen some friends arguing with anti-communists and refuting leftists, which is quite real. I think there is no need to do so.
Don't try to reason with the traitors or the left-wingers, they're all one-track minds, and they can't be reasoned with.
Don’t try to prove that we’re right, and don’t try to get the anti-Semites and left-wingers to admit it. Why bother?
I tell my friends this: when the anti-communists call you five cents, when the left wingers call you a right dog, it just proves that our middle path is correct!
Many people had ideals when they were young, but when they got older, they forgot their ideals, or pursued their ideals, but became obsessed.
and our ideals are getting farther and farther away, and even the dragon-slaying young man has become an evil dragon.
I think left and right generally refers to constraints and freedom, and China as a whole should be left-leaning due to its historical cultural innate genes.
Domestic right-wing freedom, which focuses on efficiency and development, and left-wing strengthening supervision, focuses more on fairness and safety.
Now the society as a whole hopes to pay more attention to fairness, while China and the United States are in dispute, and the tilt to the left is positive, and it is estimated that it will continue for many years.
Although I don't understand it, a like is enough.
Just say nothing, Hua Hua is so righteous
In the past two years, the blockade and encirclement of Huawei's chips by the United States has not only put Huawei into an unprecedented predicament, but also caused huge losses to "American-affiliated" enterprises.
The suppression of China’s chip industry by the United States and the simultaneous blockade of China’s chip industry by its own enterprises and allied countries have directly caused the orders and profits of global chip suppliers to be affected, resulting in a reduction in R&D investment and production capacity of chip production enterprises, and causing a shortage and disorder in the global chip supply chain.
Nowadays, the "chip shortage" has affected all major industries in the world. For example, automobile manufacturers have stopped production, and mobile phones have increased in price. Almost all industries that use chips are deeply affected by it.
In order to control the "chips" autonomy, more and more national tech giants have begun to take the path of "de-Americanization".
In order to firmly control the global semiconductor control and contain the development of China's semiconductor industry, the United States has recently taken frequent actions, such as holding a "chip summit" and inviting 64 giants to establish a semiconductor alliance, and providing funds to support domestic technology giants in the United States. For example, the old-fashioned technology giant Intel in the United States spent 20 billion US dollars to build two wafer processing plants in Arizona in order to regain its dominant position in the chip field, and opened its chip outsourcing business to the outside world.
When most people think that Intel's move will have a certain impact on TSMC, and it is very likely to take away TSMC's "rice bowl".
The reason for such confidence is that Intel, as an old technology giant in the United States, has been deeply engaged in the semiconductor field for decades, and has a large number of talents and technical reserves. It is bound to rise rapidly in the short term and defeat TSMC.
However, TSMC founder Morris Chang did not care about Intel's decision.
At the "2021 Master Think Tank Forum" held in April this year, Zhang Zhonghua's words were surprising. For Intel's investment in building wafer factories, Zhang Zhonghua did not hesitate to say: It is quite ironic for Intel to build a chip foundry.
The reason why Zhang Zhonghua was very disdainful of Intel's foray into the wafer field was that Zhang Zhonghua still held a grudge against the relationship between TSMC and Intel more than 30 years ago.
In the 1960s and 1970s, Intel was the jewel of the American manufacturing industry, standing at the top of the world, and was the overlord of the world's semiconductor industry.
Until the 1980s, the world's high-end semiconductor chips were dominated by a few strong players.
At that time, the semiconductor industry was characterized by the IDM model. The chip was designed, manufactured and tested by one factory. Intel was the representative of that era.
However, such a model has put a heavy burden on some small and medium-sized enterprises, and many semiconductor entrepreneurs have to give up in the face of huge production line construction costs.
Under the influence of market demand, after entering the 1980s, the chip industry began to show the phenomenon of division of labor and cooperation. In 1984, Zhang Zhonghua heard that there was a company specializing in chip design, and he thought that since there was a company specializing in design, a company specializing in wafer manufacturing could be established.
Not long after, Zhang Zhongmou's idea became a reality, and TSMC came into being.
TSMC focuses its main business on the single link of "wafer processing" and does not engage in design, but only provides foundry services for wafer manufacturing.
At that time, TSMC, which had just been established, was just a little guy in front of the giant Intel.
In order to obtain capital support, Zhang Zhonghua once sought investment from Intel, but at that time, as soon as Intel heard that TSMC was only engaged in the manufacturing links of the chip industry, it obviously looked down on TSMC, and decisively refused to invest in TSMC.
Zhang Zhongmou also recognized that Intel was looking down on the wafer process services at that time.
It is unexpected that the giants who once looked down on wafer manufacturing services have to start doing wafer foundry.
Therefore, Zhang Zhonghua felt that it was ironic for Intel to enter the wafer foundry business.
Today, TSMC's market value has surpassed that of Intel.
Faced with TSMC's strong offensive, Intel naturally did not dare to be complacent.
Today, TSMC is racing towards 3nm chips, while Intel is still at 14nm, which was 7 years ago.
It is not easy to catch up.
I can't wait
It's been 2 hours since I placed the order at 19:06 😅
Today, let’s take a look at some [strange hot searches].
What is normal public opinion?
Randomly select three hot searches: the second day of the second lunar month, the price increase of Goodfriend, and the Huolala incident. The public opinion spread to form a wave peak, and then the "index dropped" (smoothed curve) and finally dissipated. If secondary public opinion is generated, there will be a small hump again.
They look like the "network public opinion evolution model" shown on the official website of the Cyberspace Administration of China.
What is an abnormal public opinion?
Randomly select six hot searches in the same event, and present a "lonely peak", "sawtooth" and "cliff" shape.
The [solitary peak shape] means that it was artificially heated, quickly rushed to the top of the hot search list, and aroused public attention; the [sawtooth shape] means that it was periodically heated to ensure that the topic remained on the hot search list; and the [cliff shape] means that it was collectively evacuated. This hot search has completed its "function" and received a new task and rushed to a new battlefield.
In Figure 9, the peak of one event's heat just happened to be the trough of another event's heat, and the time was accurate to the minute and second. This must have been when the unified water army received the task and opened a new round of offensive.
The professionalization of black public relations is evident: dozens of hot searches are on the list at the same time, some attract attention, some are responsible for popular science, some instigate conflicts and create momentum, some divert attention, some influence cognition, some mislead judgment, some incite emotions, and some affect decision-making. The black industry account operates in batches and at different nodes with precision, almost taking into account all the elements involved in the spread of public opinion.
Propaganda is a science. If you set aside all the subjective factors such as positions and emotions, and just look at the objective data, black public relations will have nowhere to hide.
Those who pass by must leave traces. We will dig out these traces together.

Mauritius and other countries have found cases of Omicron variant infection for the first time - Xinhua Net
Beijing, December 12, 2021 (Xinhua) -- According to reports from foreign correspondents of Xinhua News Agency, Mauritius, Cyprus and Malawi have recently reported the first cases of infection with the Omicron variant of the new coronavirus.
On the 10th, Mauritius reported two cases of infection with the Omicron strain for the first time.
One of the infected persons is a tourist who arrived in Mauritius on November 27 from South Africa, according to Mauritius Health Minister Kailesh Jagutpal. The other infected person is a local resident who tested positive on November 30 after coming into contact with a person who had recently returned from South Africa.
After being isolated and treated in the hospital, the nucleic acid test results of these two infected persons turned negative, and they have now returned to their respective places of residence.
On the 10th, the Cypriot Ministry of Health announced that the country had confirmed its first three cases of the Omicron variant.
These three people were all students who returned from abroad at the beginning of this month. Due to their mild symptoms, they were not admitted to the hospital for treatment.
In order to prevent the spread of the Omicron strain, the government of Serbia is constantly intensifying its prevention and control efforts.
From December 6 to January 10, 2023, passengers over the age of 12 who enter the country by plane must pay for a nucleic acid test at the airport upon arrival.
The Seychelles Ministry of Health announced on the 10th that it will start vaccinating children aged 5 to 11 with the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine.
Malawian Health Minister Khumbize Chiponda said on the 9th that the country has discovered three cases of Omicron strain infection for the first time.
The country's health department found these three cases of infection after conducting genomic sequencing on 12 COVID-19 positive samples collected from November 9 to December 2.

Da Mei 360 integrated home decoration
Address: No. 156 Huancheng South Road, Room 12, Happy Home
At first, I was introduced by a friend because of trust, so I chose to take a look. My initial budget was 70,000 for a basic renovation.
A series of tricks began once they entered the store.
I went to the store for the first time just to show them my floor plan, and they didn't go to measure the house in person. They were able to give me a quote saying that my 135 square meter house could be done for 70,000. They showed me some of their materials, but I didn't know what brand of materials they were.
Their second trick is to drag you into the shop and make you pay the deposit (which you can never get back, unless you have enough experience to argue with them).
When I was hesitating whether to pay the deposit or not, they would invite their so-called managers to tell you that if you pay the deposit today, we can give you some discounts.
This is a big pit, I am a living example, and I paid a deposit of more than 10,000 yuan in a moment of impulsiveness.
His quote had a lot of problems, $70,000 didn't include the plumbing and electrical, and didn't include any doors or cabinets, and the bathroom, and those three things are the bulk of the base costs.
Aside from these, their service point fees are also higher than those of other companies.
I have lost trust in this company. They asked me to sign the contract without telling me anything at the beginning.
When I went to get my money back they were very experienced and had a special little team to deal with you.
No matter what, they will insist that it is the customer's problem, and they are completely blameless.
There are various excuses and many details. I don't want to talk about them one by one. In short, don't choose them, because the house that my friend had renovated by them is also of poor quality, and they will charge you various fees later.
Damn it, they are just the original fraudulent dragon head decoration, now changed to Da Mei, it seems that they have gone bankrupt again and changed to something else.
So don't choose such a shitty renovation company.
In the future, everyone should do some research on Baidu and consult on these things before making a choice because renovation is not a small amount of money.
Please log in or register if you want to ask a question to the merchant.
It is strictly prohibited to publish any form of merchant comments. Please refer to the Merchant Inclusion Statement for details.

If it is not delivered within 30 minutes, please cancel the order!
Is there no other way? For example, change the address?
Okay, then don't cancel this conversation. If you don't return my money within 5 to 10 days, I will definitely pursue it.
I asked if I could cancel in less than 15 minutes

Starry Sky You丨The Geminid meteor shower will reach its peak on the 14th - Xinhua Net
Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, December 12th (Reporter Zhou Runjian) The astronomical popular science expert introduced that as the last large-scale meteor shower of the year, the Geminid meteor shower, one of the three major meteor showers in the Northern Hemisphere, will reach its peak on December 14th. Friends who like meteor showers can observe it in the latter half of the night on that day.
On December 13, 2018, Beijing astronomy enthusiast An Jiu took the Geminid meteor shower in Qinghai.
Most meteor showers are caused by periodic comets, but the Geminid meteor shower is caused by 3200 Phaethon, an Apollo-type asteroid.
The Geminids are also the second known meteor shower not to be "birthed" by a comet.
Xiu Lipeng, a council member of the Tianjin Astronomical Society and an astronomy popularization expert, said that just like New Year blockbusters, the Geminid meteor shower usually appears at the end of the year, and the "screening period" can last from December 4th to 17th.
This meteor shower is known for its large and steady flow, and is called one of the three major meteor showers in the northern hemisphere together with the Quadrantids and the Perseids.
One of the distinctive features of the Geminid meteor shower is that the meteor speed is relatively slow, with rich colors and many fireballs, which is suitable for both visual observation and astrophotography for beginners.
On December 13, 2020, Yang Jing, an astronomy enthusiast in Tianjin, photographed the Geminid meteor shower in Jizhou, Tianjin.
The astronomical forecast shows that this year's Geminid meteor shower will reach its maximum around 15:00 on December 14, with a ZHR (the number of meteors seen per hour when the radiant is directly overhead under ideal conditions) of 150.
The Geminid meteor shower recommendation index chart.
"Last year, the Geminid meteor shower left a deep impression on people, but this year's Geminid meteor shower will be affected by moonlight, and its brilliance will be discounted.
November 14 is the 11th day of the 11th lunar month, and the phase of the moon is a waxing gibbous moon. The bright moonlight will interfere with observations, but fortunately, the moon will set in the latter half of the night, and the radiant point of the Geminid meteor shower will also rise higher.
Friends who like meteor showers can observe for a few hours after the moon sets in the latter half of the night, but pay attention to keeping warm. "
How can you see as many meteors as possible?
"It is not recommended to observe in the city. You can choose an open place with high altitude, little light pollution and facing northeast direction in the suburbs or countryside, and then wait patiently until the moon sets, and then you can observe with the naked eye.
Note that the Gemini meteor shower has a large flow in all directions, so there is no need to keep looking at the radiant point of the Gemini meteor shower when observing.
If you like photography and want to shoot a gorgeous "meteor shower picture", it is best to choose a wide-angle, large-aperture lens, and use high-ISO and maximum aperture when shooting.
Based on considerations of stability and continuity, a tripod, spare batteries, and a shutter release cable are also indispensable. "
Xie Lipeng reminded.
What is the difference in market positioning between laser TV and traditional TV?
In my understanding, the traditional TV mentioned by the questioner should refer to the LCD TV, and the difference in market positioning between the laser TV and the LCD TV is mainly as follows:
First, laser TV is more focused on the large-screen market.
Compared with the market positioning of LCD TVs, laser TVs are obviously more focused on the large-screen market, or it can be said that laser TVs are products born for large screens.
Currently, the mainstream LCD TV sizes are from 55 inches to 65 inches, while the laser TV sizes are generally above 75 inches, with the largest exceeding 100 inches, fully meeting users' demand for large-screen color televisions.
In recent years, the shipment and sales ratio of laser TVs in the global market has been continuously increasing, accounting for more than 60% of the total TV sales of 80 inches and above.
According to the forecast of Zhongyikang, the sales growth of the laser TV market will exceed 140% in 2020, and continue to maintain rapid growth.
The reason why it achieved such good results in the big screen market is mainly due to the excellent performance of the laser TV in eye protection.
Based on the imaging principle of laser TV diffuse reflection, the light emitted by the laser light source does not directly shine into the eyeball. Compared with the backlight of the LCD TV, the imaging process is closer to the imaging process of objects under natural conditions, and the stimulation to the eyes is also smaller.
The Cesi laboratory of the China Electronics Standardization Research Institute and the ophthalmology experts of Peking Union Medical College Hospital conducted a strict comparison experiment on watching laser TV and LCD TV under the same conditions of the crowd, and obtained 144 sets of test data.
The data shows that the laser TV does have a strong eye-protection characteristic, and even has a certain improving effect in certain aspects.
At a time when eye health is becoming more and more important, laser TVs have attracted more and more users with their eye protection advantages, and also opened another breakthrough in the color TV market.
Second, laser TV is more focused on the high-end market.
In contrast to the falling prices of LCD TVs, the prices of currently available laser TVs are mostly more than 10,000 yuan. With the upgrade of size and light source, the prices will gradually rise.
Why is a laser TV so expensive?
I'm sure there's a reason for it.
With the continuous development of light source and technology, laser TV has many advantages that cannot be achieved by LCD TV and projector.
With the ultra-short focal length projection technology, the projection distance of the laser TV is relatively shorter than that of the traditional projector, and it can achieve a 100-inch large-screen experience within a short distance. The space required is not large, and the host is small and takes up very little space.
In terms of brightness, the large-brand laser TV can reach more than 2000 lumens.
In addition, it generates less heat, has less impact on the equipment, and the television has a longer life span.
In addition, many high-end laser TV models are equipped with true 4K ultra-high-definition picture quality, artificial intelligence systems, bionic screens, and many other cutting-edge technologies, which can give users a more shocking audio-visual experience.
It is not a false demand, but a product of demand segmentation. In terms of picture quality and cost-benefit ratio, the laser TV is not a dish for audio and video players. If you want to take into account the large screen and insufficient viewing environment, you can try it. Everything has its pros and cons. After weighing the pros and cons, you can make your own judgment. I am afraid that I will listen to one-sided words.
Simply put, ultra-wide-angle near-focus projectors, such as laser TVs, must use expensive ultra-wide-angle lenses and reflectors in order to approach the screen, which is not in line with the best optical design.
To block some of the ambient light, a micro-structured Fresnel screen is used, which is very expensive, and the price of an 80-inch screen is basically the same as that of a 65-inch LCD.
There is one more thing, I especially hate when projector manufacturers take the "diffuse reflection is good for the eyes" as a selling point, please, the light on the screen that the eyes can see is direct light for the eyes, you diffuse it to the ceiling, the eyes can't see it either, if you have to be serious, the LCD TV is also "diffuse" "direct", when you turn on the TV, doesn't the ceiling also get illuminated?
In addition, if the projection screen is not a diffuse reflection, it will not be able to form an image at all.
The hot spot (light spot) effect of the high-gain screen has been ignored, which is really uncomfortable when a large amount of light is reflected into the eyes from a certain angle.
The Wenshe Visual Aesthetics Photography Gallery is a selected quality shop. It does not have any branches for the time being.
After adding WeChat to make an appointment, the little sister arranged the time I could choose and sent it to me. The reply was relatively timely.
Before leaving, I looked at the photos in the store. There were more outdoor wedding dresses, which were very beautiful, and the shooting styles involved were also many.
After arriving that day, I had a simple exchange of ideas with the older sister. She was very patient and helped me try on two sets of the styles I was struggling with. Finally, we decided to start with the makeup and styling. Before the photographer took the pictures, he would set up some props and give instructions on the poses. He was also very meticulous about every detail.
However, it may be because I didn't communicate with him about the specific shooting ideas, so the result wasn't the style I wanted, but it should be good-looking 🙊🙊
After the shoot, the photographer will help select the photos and discuss the post-processing style, which feels quite attentive.
It takes about half a month to repair the film, and wait for the effect~
I won the photo class's all-you-can-eat activity for the second time~ Most of the clothes in the field can choose one for shooting.
In the end, I chose a black tulle skirt to experience a different style.
The whole shooting process takes about 2 hours, including makeup and shooting. The photographer responsible for the shooting is the younger brother of a post-95, who still feels a bit green. I hope that he can give more advice on customer shooting actions in the future. He is quite talkative and the shooting process is pleasant.
The Visual Aesthetics Photography Gallery, the selected quality store, replied.
Queenie is on the home page now, come and take a look~
When you arrive, fill in your name and phone number first, and then choose your clothing. Wedding dresses can also be chosen. I changed into three or four sets of clothing, and they were quite patient. After choosing, it took a long time to put on makeup. The service attitude was also good. Later, during the photo shoot, they would teach you how to pose. It's just that the photos made my face look so big. Retouching was said to take half a month, and I received them in three or four days. It felt like there was not much difference from the original shots.
[Environment] Overall, it's pretty good.
There's a lot of options for clothing.
There are about three makeup positions, and inside is a photo studio.
The service was warm and attentive.
The stylists are very patient.
Photographers will also give you serious instructions on how to pose.
If the photographer is not satisfied, he will also take the initiative to reshoot.
[Experience] The style may be a bit exaggerated. The original double eyelids were turned into triple eyelids.
The ends of my eyebrows were also shaved off, which is a bit awkward for someone who doesn't normally draw their eyebrows.
The photos were given to me more than ten days ago, but I was not very satisfied with the P-picture effect. It felt that the double eyelid stickers were still very obvious.
Because I didn't know what style I wanted, I tried two sets of clothes. In the end, I chose the black dress. The little sister said that this set was more Hepburn vintage style.
After choosing the clothes, I started to do my makeup and hair. The hairstylist and makeup artist were both very patient and helped me a lot. I was very satisfied with the results.
After the makeup was done, we started to take photos. The photographer gave me instructions on how to pose the whole time. The process was very relaxed and harmonious.
After the shooting, I carefully selected four of my favorite ones for retouching. The young man said that the photos would be ready within 15 days, and I was very satisfied with the result.
It's been 3 days and I haven't received a reply...I can't join the #PRS_ORG# plus monthly plan due to your system's inability to recognize my credit card!
The strangest thing was that I used the same credit card every time I paid
Now I have to pay for shipping every time.
Can I be exempted first, and then you can collect my monthly fee after your investigation is complete?
Is it reliable to buy insurance for a small umbrella?
Xiaoyu Umbrella is an online insurance brokerage platform.
In terms of setting conditions: According to the “Regulations on the Supervision of Insurance Brokerage Institutions (Revised in 2015)”, in order to become an insurance brokerage company, it must meet three key words: shareholders, initiators with no major illegal records in the past three years, and a minimum amount of RMB 50 million can be established, and it must be approved by the China Insurance Regulatory Commission.
These three are actually very demanding, and can be summed up as having strength, being approved by the national authoritative department of the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (which regulates insurance companies and banks nationwide), and having shareholders with good conduct. As an umbrella insurance for insurance brokerage companies, policyholders do not need to question whether the umbrella insurance is regular or not. After all, there are these three thresholds, and not every insurance company can meet them.
At this point, it's not bad, and it's trustworthy.
From the perspective of insurance products: Xiaoyusan insurance is an insurance supermarket. Many companies' star critical illness insurances are sold on this platform. For example, the recently listed Hetai Super Mary No. 5 critical illness insurance, the claimant and the insurer are both Hetai Life Insurance, and Xiaoyusan insurance is just a third-party intermediary. There is no need to question its credibility.
In terms of payment methods: Internet platform products, because of the lack of operating costs of business outlets and the cost of business staff salaries, Internet products are generally cost-effective, and payment methods are flexible, supporting monthly payments, reducing the payment pressure of the insured, and maximizing the leverage of insurance at the same time.
This is very good.
It can be considered.
In terms of the professionalism of sales staff: this is particularly important, because insurance is a highly professional industry, and many Internet insurance customers can insure themselves. This will lead to a lot of misunderstandings. In terms of health declaration and profession, non-insurance practitioners often add their own subjective consciousness when applying for insurance. They think they are healthy or meet the requirements, which will easily lead to many hidden risks in claims and the risk of being rejected.
I myself have done insurance telephone sales in "Tencent Micro-Insurance" (similar to a small umbrella, it is also an internet insurance brokerage platform), and I told everyone very responsibly.
Internet insurance is true and reliable, but it is the people who are not reliable. There are no professional practitioners in the Internet channel, and there is a lot of sales misinformation.
For example, 1 yuan for 6 million yuan of insurance, buy insurance and get a mobile phone, receive 60,000 yuan of critical illness insurance for free, these marketing strategies are not wrong, but they avoid the main issue and will not tell the policyholder that the first month is 1 yuan, and the second month is charged at the normal rate, which varies from tens to 200 yuan. Many customers do not know what they have bought after deducting the fee for one or two years.
I thought I could spend 1 yuan, and the insurance company would pay 6 million yuan (it was a pie in the sky).
Free mobile phones are given away for special policy numbers such as 6666 or 8888, and if you win, no one will remind you to redeem the prize.
(This is another pitfall for the policyholder) The free 60,000 critical illness insurance is short-term. If you only rely on this and have no other commercial insurance, what can the 60,000 yuan be used for in the event of a critical illness? It will not solve the problem, and you will have to live a bare life in the future.
At present, the state is also cracking down on the misguidance of Internet insurance sales.
Therefore, in general, there is no problem with the platform, and there is no problem with the products. The problem lies in the professionalism and professional ethics of the sales staff.
It is recommended that the questioner consider comprehensively and carefully. In fact, the products of many offline insurance brokerage companies are wider, and customers have more opportunities and products to choose from. The cost-effectiveness of some products is also better than that of Internet products.
I have personally helped 59 internet customers to insure offline products, saving each person 2,000 to 3,000 yuan per year.
If you have any questions, please feel free to communicate and exchange with me.
Me: Mingya insurance broker, with 3 years of enterprise management training experience, served nearly 1,000 enterprise users, and cooperated with more than 100 insurance companies. Before applying for insurance, I will tailor-make insurance products according to the needs of customers. In the process of applying for insurance, I will compare three insurance companies for customers and strive for the best underwriting result for customers. After applying for insurance, I will organize and manage insurance policies for customers, so that customers can rest assured and worry-free.
Grow together with every customer for a lifetime.
I hope my answer is helpful to the questioner!
According to the definition of the insurance regulatory department, Internet insurance refers to the insurance business that the policyholder can independently complete all the insurance procedures after clicking the insurance link.
In this process, the policyholder does not need to sign, and the insurance consultant does not need to sign. All steps can be completed by the policyholder independently.
Although Internet insurance has no "sense of ceremony" in applying for insurance, and may not even have a printed paper contract, this does not affect the effectiveness and legal force of the electronic contract in any way.
This model is somewhat similar to the assembly line work of "phone sales," but there is a fatal problem with purchasing insurance in this way, and that is that follow-up service may not keep up.
Insurance is usually a long-term contract that lasts for decades. When we buy insurance, should we seriously consider whether the "intermediary" we choose is a "insurance intermediary" that can accompany us for a long time and provide us with services many years later?

No problem, remember no need to arrange redelivery, I have already bought another, don't want to waste
Thank you for your help
From the past to the present, I have always opposed any form of slander and abuse, and cannot accept such personal attacks.
In civilized society, we can tolerate everything, but we must put an end to such scoundrels.
If we don't look at political parties and factions, the first thing to resist is this uncivilized style.
From the time you started sending me Facebook friend requests, making sarcastic posts, to your attempt to post my so-called home address and my father's name on social media, I have taken an attitude of not responding.
After that, you not only continued to tag me at a frequency of six times a day, but also continued to discuss some implicit and humiliating comments about me with your so-called friends on Facebook, such as my looks, body shape, fertility, and whether to plant strawberries in bed or not. I... just let it go.
How could I have known that I would later receive messages from multiple friends about your Facebook friend account uploading a photo of you and making remarks containing sexual harassment.
I am sorry, as a woman, I can no longer remain silent.
After the news of my reporting to the police was uploaded, you did not restrain yourself at all, but became even more arrogant.
I don't care what your political background is, and I don't care what your status is. In our society, it is necessary to respect both men and women.
Yes, you can continue to make snarky, cryptic, demeaning, insulting remarks, you can continue to say that you are just caring and concerned about me, you can continue to think that this is not harassment, and you can even continue to deny that you made the pictures or continue to make all manner of aggressive statements.
That's right, I can't, and I don't have the ability to stop you.
I don't know you, and I don't want to know you. My appearance and figure don't need your evaluation.
I don't even think any girl would be willing to let someone humiliate her like that for fame.
A friend asked me, how are you doing?
I said so, and you won't believe it.
I don't think any girl can say she's fine after being bullied like that.
In the workplace, in society, in politics or in business, it is only those who lack basic decency who would choose to hurt any woman in this way.
I believe that justice lies in the hearts of the people.
I have cut some of the comments for you to judge.
No one should be able to impersonate you if you post yourself
I can only say that you are a public enemy of civilization.

Vietnam People's Daily Online - Vietnamese Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh Attends the Third Vietnam National Digital Technology Enterprise Development Forum
Two main meetings were held during the third Vietnam National Digital Technology Enterprise Development Forum, discussing the topics of digital technology enterprises and national digital transformation, digital technology enterprises and COVID-19 and post-COVID-19 economic recovery and development.
Minister of Information and Communications Nguyen Manh Hung said that in 2021, despite the continuous spread of COVID-19, the number and revenue of Vietnamese digital technology enterprises still maintained a growth trend, reaching nearly 10%.
In 2021, the number of typical digital products in Vietnam increased, focusing on solving the major problems faced by Vietnam. Many digital products have gone abroad, and Vietnam's digital technology ranking has been improved.
Minister Ruan Mengxiong called on digital technology enterprises to take on the responsibility of developing the national digital transformation platform and take on the task of developing these national digital platforms as a national mission.
In the forum, leaders from various departments and state agencies, as well as enterprises, organizations and individuals engaged in the research, development, application and transfer of digital technologies, shared their ideas and solutions for mobilizing and gathering resources from the whole society to develop Vietnamese technology enterprises, promoting the digital transformation of the country, and post-epidemic economic recovery.
Prime Minister Fan Mingzheng emphasized in his speech at the forum that digital transformation is an inevitable path for the world, and an objective demand for development.
Digital transformation has become a global issue, and digital transformation serves the whole nation, so it is necessary to mobilize the whole nation to participate.
People and enterprises are the core, subject, goal and driving force of digital transformation.
Therefore, all policies must be for the people and enterprises.
Prime Minister Fan Mingzheng emphasized that digital transformation must reflect the national spirit, and must rely on internal power, strategy, long-term and decisive factors, and external power as an important and breakthrough point.
He also believes that the digital transformation needs to drive the development towards depth and sustainable development, participate in the prevention and control of the COVID-19 pandemic, economic recovery and development, respond to subsequent changes, overcome the phenomenon of natural resource depletion, and help the green transformation and the development of green energy.
Digital transformation needs to participate in the work of building a database for the protection and promotion of relevant national cultural values, historical traditions, national customs and customs, and promote the digital transformation of banks, taxation, land management and development, and logistics and other fields.
The biggest goal of digital transformation is to make people happier and the country more prosperous and developed.
Prime Minister Fan Mingzheng called on all levels of government, all levels of agencies, and enterprises to increase their leadership and guidance in the development of digital technology, improve their understanding of digital transformation, continue to formulate and improve the system for digital transformation, strengthen national management, and promote the development of digital technology enterprises based on the spirit of respect, communication, listening, and proactivity.
During the forum, Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh attended the 2021 "Made in Vietnam" Outstanding Digital Product Awards ceremony and the opening ceremony of "Made in Vietnam" digital products.

The main stream of the Yangtze River achieves full coverage of water-based green comprehensive service area - Xinhua News Agency
Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, December 11 (Reporter Wang Xian) The Fuling Water-based Green Comprehensive Service Area in Chongqing was completed and put into operation as scheduled on the 10th. This is the second water-based green comprehensive service area to be officially operated in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River after the Luzhou Water-based Green Comprehensive Service Area in Sichuan Province was officially operated on the 8th.
So far, the water-based green comprehensive service area has covered the upper, middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River.
Qiu Jianhua, vice president of the Yangtze River Navigation Management Bureau of the Ministry of Transport, introduced that, previously, provinces such as Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui and Jiangsu have built and run 10 water green comprehensive service areas in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, which have been recognized by a large number of sailors and played an important role in promoting the high-quality development of Yangtze River navigation.
The full coverage of the green comprehensive service area on the water is another milestone event in the construction of the Yangtze River green navigation, and the Yangtze River ship pollutant reception and navigation service capacity have been significantly improved.
According to the introduction, the green comprehensive service area on the water is an important facility for providing all-round production and living services to a large number of ships and crew members and helping a large number of crew members solve the “urgent, difficult, and urgent” problems.
The two water-based green comprehensive service areas in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, which have been built and put into operation this time, integrate life services, production services and government services, take green and environmental protection as the theme, take ship repair and ship emergency rescue services as the characteristics, and realize the "one docking, multiple services" for ships in the port, which will make the work of the crew sailing on the Yangtze River more efficient and life more convenient.
Three US aircraft carriers are gathering around China, the most powerful weapon in the US Navy’s arsenal makes a rare visit to Guam 2022-01-17 Duowei, a pro-Chinese Communist Party media: Latest news on Sino-US relations: New satellite images show that three US aircraft carriers are gathering around China; US media also revealed that one of the most powerful weapons in the US Navy’s arsenal made a rare visit to Guam, sending an important signal to the United States’ allies and enemies in the Indo-Pacific region.
According to the China think tank “South China Sea Strategic Situation Perception Platform”, on January 9, the satellite found the US Navy “Carl Vinson” (USS Carl Vinson) aircraft carrier near the Bab al-Mandeb Strait.
The Balabac Strait connects the South China Sea and the Sulu Sea, and is a strategic point on the first island chain in the western Pacific.
The platform expects that the “Carl Vinson” will be deployed in the South China Sea.
This was the first deployment of F-35C fighter jets and CMV-22 "Osprey" carrier on-board delivery aircraft by the "USS Carl Vinson" aircraft carrier.
In addition to the "Carl Vincent" aircraft carrier, there is also the "Abraham Lincoln" aircraft carrier (USS Abraham Lincoln), which departed from the United States on January 3.
The "Lincoln" also carried the F-35C carrier-based fighter squadron for the first time. This squadron belongs to the 314th fighter attack squadron of the United States Marine Corps.
In addition to the two aircraft carriers mentioned above, the U.S. Navy currently has the “Ronald Reagan” (USS Ronald Reagan) aircraft carrier docked in Yokosuka, Japan deployed in the Asia-Pacific region.
The aircraft carrier battle group also includes the "Champlain Lake" missile cruiser and the "Stockdale" missile destroyer.
Three US aircraft carriers gather around China, and the most powerful weapon makes a rare visit to Guam. On January 17, 2022, the “South China Sea Strategic Situation Perception Platform” released the latest satellite images, showing that three U.S. aircraft carriers were gathering around China.
(Weibo @South China Sea Strategic Situation Probing Initiative) Three US aircraft carriers gather around China; the most powerful weapon makes a rare visit to Guam. On January 17, 2022, the flight route of the US Navy’s CMV-22B carrier-based transport aircraft.
(Weibo @South China Sea Strategic Situation Probing Initiative) According to a report by CNN on January 17, one of the most powerful weapons in the U.S. Navy's arsenal made a rare visit to Guam over the weekend.
The Ohio-class nuclear submarine USS Nevada, carrying 20 Trident (Trident) ballistic missiles and dozens of nuclear warheads, entered the U.S. naval base in Guam last Saturday (January 15th).
The three American aircraft carriers gathered around China, and the most powerful weapon made a rare visit to Guam. Analysts said that this sent a signal to the allies and enemies in the increasingly tense situation in the Indo-Pacific region.
It is the first visit of a U.S. ballistic missile submarine to Guam since 2016, and the second public visit to Guam since the 1980s.
The three U.S. aircraft carriers gathered in the vicinity of China, and the most powerful weapon made a rare visit to Guam. In recent years, China has built a large number of military facilities in the South China Sea.
This is Yongshu Reef in the South China Sea.
(South China Sea Research Forum) The U.S. Navy said in a statement that the visit of the Ohio-class nuclear submarine “Nevada” to Guam this time enhanced cooperation between the United States and its allies in the region, demonstrated the capabilities, flexibility, combat readiness, and continued commitment of the United States to the security and stability of the Indo-Pacific region.
Ballistic missile submarines are often called "boomer" submarines.
The movements of the 14 "rumbling submarines" in the US Navy fleet are usually kept strictly confidential.
The secret surrounding the ballistic missile submarine made the "Thunderbolt submarine" become "the most important survival weapon in the nuclear triad", and this system also includes the ballistic missiles in the launch wells on the mainland of the United States, as well as the B-2 and B-52 bombers which can carry nuclear warheads.
When chatting with friends about the recent 26% fall of Meta and the loss of $251 billion in market value, Zuckerberg responded that "facing unprecedented competition", what was the reason?
Meta (formerly Facebook) is essentially an advertising company, and most of its revenue comes from advertising. In this day and age, an advertising company that makes money has its own traffic channels.
Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and so on, no matter what functional positioning, they are all traffic channels for Meta.
In addition, Meta is the largest "advertising alliance". Many apps use Meta's advertising to monetize through Meta's advertising platform.
But times have changed.
First, because of the adjustment of Apple’s privacy policy, it is difficult for Meta to obtain user data information, which has affected the efficiency of advertising.
Apple's current privacy policy is very user-friendly, and will clearly prompt users whether to allow apps to obtain their information. Most people's normal response is certainly not to allow it.
If Google stabs again, the impact on Meta's revenue will be even greater.
Second, the Chinese factor in Meta's revenue growth has been weakened (the proportion of this factor is uncertain, but it does exist).
Everyone knows that Meta has no business in China, but this understanding is not accurate.
At least 10% of Meta’s annual revenue comes from China, mainly from Chinese companies doing business overseas.
Meta has a few hundred employees in its Hong Kong office, and several major agents on the mainland.
Chinese companies want to expand their overseas markets, and Meta is an unavoidable advertising channel. Most of the money spent is given to Meta.
It is interesting that now ByteDance's TT is one of the main competitors of Meta, but Meta earned a lot of money from ByteDance in the past two years.
All the domestic agents are helping ByteDance to place advertisements at Meta, and Meta's performance in Greater China is also very good.
I haven't specifically looked into it recently, but it can't be better than before.
The stage of Chinese companies burning money on a large scale overseas has passed.
Third, the expansion of new traffic channels is not smooth.
Facebook is getting older, and new platforms like TT are not in the hands of Meta.
The biggest problem is not just a drop in income, but the lack of growth expectations.
The capital market is not only concerned with income, but more importantly, it is concerned about the expectations for the future.
It's clear that Meta's expectations were not met.
In order to tell a new story to the market, Zuckerberg talked about the "metaverse".
The metaverse is indeed one of the directions of the future, but the implementation cycle of the metaverse is relatively long, and this story is not enough to support Meta's market value in the next two to three years.
Therefore, the next two years should be a difficult period for Meta.
Don't look at the glory of Facebook now. It has an annual income of US$100 billion to US$200 billion. In fact, Facebook has a very strong sense of crisis. Compared with other Internet companies and high-tech companies, it has no good and safe moat.
Although his several social software now have high daily active users and are mainstream social software, such as Facebook, WhatsApp, etc., but in the face of the rapid development of TikTok, Facebook does not have much confidence, and it can be overturned in the blink of an eye.
As for the elusive concept of the metaverse, there is no hope of success in the short term, so Facebook is very dangerous. This is also the fundamental reason why Zuckerberg changed the name of the company and kept looking for new tracks. However, I think his choice of track is wrong, and it is a dead end. The above are some of my thoughts for your reference.
