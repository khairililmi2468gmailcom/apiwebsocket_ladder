At the Zhejiang University Academic Conference, the students played the leading role. The research results opened up people's minds - Xinhua News Agency
Use air to wash hands, use breath to diagnose disease, and accurately search for the source of smog. Last night, at the opening ceremony of the 2016 Academic Annual Conference of Zhejiang University, a series of innovative academic results were commended.
The main researchers of these achievements are all students. The research covers major fields such as the environment, machinery, energy, medicine, life sciences, and humanities education. The students started from a curious idea and created many high-end inventions with application value, some of which have won awards at home and abroad.
Biosensors: Your home doctor
The team of Dr. Zhang Diming, a doctoral student from the School of Biomedical Engineering, demonstrated a biosensor on a smartphone, which is only half the size of a smartphone.
"All you need to do is take a light breath, and this set of instruments can preliminarily detect the health status of your body from the gas components you exhale. "
Zhang Diming introduced that this set of sensors is connected to a smartphone, and the health report will be displayed on the phone after exhalation.
The smart bracelet on the market that can detect health conditions usually detects physical parameters such as temperature and pulse.
This set of biological sensors uses a new material, graphene, and its target is chemical elements. Its sensitive "sense of smell" allows it to more deeply and accurately reflect the body's health status.
Smart surgical lights: doctors' high-energy eyes
In addition to smart phones, smart surgical lights have also been used in the operating room.
This invention won a silver prize at the 44th Swiss Geneva International Invention Exhibition this year.
Zhu Linjing and Shen Junfei, master's students in the School of Optoelectronic Science and Engineering, have opened up a new idea in the shortcomings of traditional surgical lights and invented an intelligent LED surgical shadowless light.
"Many diseases are not detected early or removed properly, which is related to the lights used in the doctor's operating room. "
Shen Junfei said that, for example, if the doctor cannot see all the tumor tissue in time during the early examination of cancer, then the cancer cells will continue to spread.
This intelligent surgical light has four lamp discs, which can enhance the difference between different tissues under illumination by adjusting the spectrum.
During the operation, the doctor can adjust the size of the light spot, brightness, spectrum, color uniformity and shadowless rate according to the operation needs and personal habits at any time.
This intelligent surgical lamp has been tried in hospitals such as the Shao Yifu Hospital affiliated to Zhejiang University School of Medicine and the Children's Hospital affiliated to Zhejiang University School of Medicine, and has received good feedback.
Last October, this invention won the first prize of the National Challenge Cup.
Air-washing hands: water-saving and cool
Ordinary people just rinse their hands with water, at most rub some soap, squeeze some hand sanitizer, while Li Qizhang and his classmates have invented a set of “air hand washing device”.
When we stand on the device's sink, our weight compresses the air out.
"It's like a shot in the arm.
The compressed air forms a liquid at the tap, which combines with the water.
That way we can get our hands clean!"
The visible reaction and bacteria residue test proved that the effect of hand washing by this method was the same as that of ordinary hand washing.
This device only needs to rely on our own gravity as the driver. It can ensure the cleaning degree and save 90% of water. The whole process is completely energy-saving and environmentally friendly.
Last year, this invention stood out among many world-class universities at the Second Global Grand Challenges Summit and won the only gold award.
Please arrange to return it to me as soon as possible, thx
Please cancel the order and refund the cash, not the points, and I will never use #PRS_ORG# again!

If so, order as soon as possible.
Currently, there is none. Thank you.
He asked me to tell you where he is located #PRS_ORG#
I'm not waiting, cancel the order
I ordered from #PRS_ORG#, but I wrote the wrong address.
Can it be changed?
or cancel the order
Okay, thank you very much
It is a meaningful certificate, a first aid certificate.
This is one of the important skill certificates I have besides my driver's license!
Let me explain: First aid measures are actually emergency rescue measures in the event of an emergency, that is, rescue before the ambulance arrives.
It is well known that there is a period of time between the accident and the arrival of the ambulance, and it is this period of time that is the most critical.
This is when first aid is needed.
If I really had a heart attack, stroke, or stopped breathing, our window of life is only four minutes, the golden four minutes!
So it's so important that people around you know first aid!
When someone around us falls down, we can use our professional knowledge to rescue him instead of standing there doing nothing. This feeling of helplessness is terrible.
"In China, we have 300,000 accidental deaths every year, and the most dangerous one is cardiac arrest.
Across the United States, on average, 15% can be saved.
In a Las Vegas casino hotel, about 70% can be saved. In Shanghai and Beijing, it is less than 1%."
This is what Lu Le, the founder of First Response, said.
If a person is in cardiac arrest, with no breathing and no pulse, applying pressure to the neck is of no use.
It was only possible to save the person by doing artificial respiration and pressing on the outside of the chest.
I found that we still have few people who have this awareness to learn first aid, but it is too late when something happens, so I still call on everyone to learn this skill, so that we can respond in time when we are faced with an emergency.
It might even save someone's life!
The first aid certificate can be signed up at your local Red Cross training center. I signed up at the Red Cross training center in Zhuhai, and there is a student discount.
P.S. The last picture is a record of the goals I wanted to achieve before I was 25, adding the first aid certificate to the goal list was a few months ago, but I did it!
Next, I will go to take other certificates that I want to take. I plan to take a diving certificate. I saw on Little Red Book that there is also a diving first aid certificate. It seems that I need to have a first aid certificate to take this certificate, so the first aid certificate is actually very useful!
I ordered ＃#NUMBER#
One piece of shrimp dumplings costs 13 yuan?
I've never tried it.
How is #NAME# not clear?
One for 13 yuan?
Yesterday #PRS_ORG# failed to deliver food, and this time they gave me just one shrimp dumpling to eat!?
Because I clearly saw that it was valid when I entered the code before
Let's talk about the conclusion. I personally think that "Four Seas" is an all-around bad movie, in every sense of the word.
But if you say this movie has no bright spots at all, that's not true. At least the soundtrack is pretty good.
There are many kinds of bad films, and one that makes you fall asleep in the cinema is one kind, and one that makes you angry after watching it is another kind. "Four Seas" is like a monkey on Emei Mountain for the audience. It can ignite your anger in countless ways.
In terms of insulting the audience, Han Han is truly gifted.
The most painful thing about this film is that it seems to be a creature in the Cthulhu novel, indescribable and full of loopholes, just like the windbreaker on Little Ma's body.
Even after watching it, you're left wondering if there were any hidden meanings the director was trying to convey, but the more you think about it, the more you realize it's just a pile of crap.
I'll start with some of the plot points that I don't understand.
The male lead should live on a small island in the south and rely on his grandmother.
Her grandmother had a wish to see the snow, and then the plot arranged for an old man in the neighborhood to take her to the northeast to see the snow in a small van.
Elderly people take a van from the south to the northeast to see the snow?
He and his dad are also very reassured about it.
Then the old man went silent.
How did the heroine's brother get the business license to open a hotel on the abandoned ship?
Why can the small hooligans of the Flying Car Party on the island do a mountain road to block the road so easily?
Then, the truck carrying rebar stopped in the middle of the road, and even the truck drivers could not be found around.
This prop is too obvious, isn't it?
Why would a small-time hoodlum with a bad credit history and illegal suspicion become an auxiliary police officer?
Why didn't they call the police when facing usury? The police in the movie even asked if there was any difficulty?
An adult who knows how to use a smartphone but doesn't know how to use a hotel room key to open a door, and then forcibly arrange to find the hotel owner to sleep outside the room door?
This bizarre plot point permeates the whole film, and is so far-fetched that I feel pain recalling it.
Worse than the plot is the movie's theme, or rather, the movie has no theme at all, it's just an ugly Frankenstein's monster.
At the beginning of the film, you will think that he wants to shoot a comedy, 20 minutes later, you will guess that it may be an inspirational film, half an hour later, you will think that it may be a film that wants to reflect the difficulty of young people in small towns, and after watching it, you will not know what kind of film you have watched at all, followed by deep self-doubt. Why did you go to the cinema to watch the film during the Spring Festival?
For most people, they are actually very familiar with the routines of various movies. For example, if you want to shoot a motorcycle rider, it will be inspirational + comedy, and then tell the audience how a talented rookie will step by step to success.
If you want to make a love movie, then tell the love-hate relationship between the small town youth who likes to ride a motorcycle and the waitress girl.
If you want to reflect reality, then at least your plot can't have anything that doesn't exist in the real world.
(For example, the new motorbike played by Yin Zheng was just burned, and then the character can sing), we can't open some brain holes that even Kennedy can't stand.
As for the fact that the heroine is clearly not retarded but acts like a 5-year-old in some aspects, I really don't know whether this is due to her acting or the director's request.
There is another thing that I don't quite understand. As a race car driver, why is Han Han so keen to add crash scenes in his own movies?
Such a film arrangement in the Spring Festival file, is it for the trouble of the audience?

Check the concrete module production and processing equipment Zhengzhou well wall brick module equipment introduction:
Zhengzhou Yixin is a domestic concrete inspection well modular brick machine equipment, inspection well block machine, well wall body modular machine professional manufacturer, from semi-automatic to fully automatic production line.
After years of practice and development, we now have quality products, mainly including hydraulic, mobile and fully automated inspection well series equipment and supporting devices.
Check the concrete module production and processing equipment Zhengzhou well wall brick module equipment assembly site:
Check the concrete module production and processing equipment. The characteristics and advantages of Zhengzhou well wall brick module equipment:
The Yixin inspection well block brick machine device is widely applicable to the new construction materials for municipal underground structures such as coal, heat, water, electricity, and gas.
Such as various inspection wells, rainwater outlets, square ditches, septic tanks and small structures, bridge wing walls, etc. for drainage and water storage facilities.
The advantage of using concrete modules to build inspection wells is that the top, bottom, left, and right sides of the module are all concave and convex groove structures, which can be combined to form a chain lock.
The shear resistance of the wall of the well is far better than the masonry form of flat friction masonry.
The module is a hollow structure, and the longitudinal holes are connected and the transverse holes are through after the blocks are assembled. After the cores are poured, a cast-in-place concrete mesh structure is formed, which plays the role of secondary reinforcement and waterproofing.
Both the horizontal and vertical modules are equipped with reinforcement grooves, and the corresponding increase in the overall strength of the structure is achieved by the horizontal horizontal reinforcement and the vertical reinforcement.
In addition, the inspection wells and drainage wells built with concrete inspection well modules are not prone to collapse, subsidence, and leakage, and the mechanical properties of the wall modules are stable, the operation is simple, and the formed size is standard.
The concrete inspection well module brick machine device is equipped with intelligent control, data input and output device, one-key touch LCD display to monitor all mechanical operations, realize ideal human-machine dialogue, automatic analysis of material ratio, density operation, safety logic control and fault diagnosis system.
The mechanical and hydraulic system of the well wall module adopts single-cylinder hydraulic transmission and double-cylinder hydraulic transmission.
The independent hydraulic integrated station avoids the influence of the vibration of the main machine on the hydraulic system, thus ensuring the reliability of the hydraulic system.
The concrete inspection well module brick machine equipment cloth box moves forward, the mold box is demolded and rises, the storage box door is closed, and the automatic conveying pallet, all of which are completed independently by the hydraulic system, so as to reduce the wear and maintenance of the machine.
The concrete inspection well module brick machine equipment adopts imported computers and electrical appliances, sealing and hydraulic parts, and the comprehensive performance of the equipment is stable and reliable.
The mechanical excitation platform of the well-wall body module uses a whole steel plate, and the line cutting ratio of the platform is without welding points, so that the filler box can freely swing and guide, and fully reduce mechanical wear and tear.
The mold load is reduced, the filler and the two-in-one encryption amplitude are integrated and fully synchronized, and the table vibration and the mold vibration are ensured to achieve the effect of vibration compaction.
The wall panel module of the well wall uses mechanical vibration and computer automatic control to adjust the amplitude according to the cost-performance ratio of the raw materials. There is no wear-and-tear braking, thereby prolonging the service life and reducing the cost.
The well wall body module has the dual functions of mechanical automatic control and manual control.

Chongqing vocational schools pilot the modern apprenticeship system, and admission is equivalent to being a quasi-employee of the enterprise - Xinhua News Agency
Yesterday, reporters learned from the Municipal Education Commission that starting this year, our city will pilot the "Modern Apprenticeship" talent training model in 60 vocational schools. The students accepted for pilot training will have the status of apprentices. After enrollment, they will be pre-enrolled as unit employees by the pilot enterprises.
The municipal education commission requires that the enrollment and admission procedures of secondary vocational schools and the employment procedures of enterprises be standardized, and the dual identity of the students of secondary vocational schools and the pre-employees of enterprises be clarified. According to the principle of two-way selection, the apprentices, schools and enterprises shall sign a three-party agreement. For the apprentices who have reached the age of 16 and have not reached the age of 18, a four-party agreement shall be signed by the apprentices, their guardians, schools and enterprises to determine the rights and interests of each party and the specific positions, teaching content and rights and interests protection of the apprentices during their on-the-job training.
Encourage pilot schools to adopt the modern apprenticeship form and jointly carry out pre-job training and post-job training with cooperative enterprises.
Pilot schools need to reform their talent cultivation model.
The school and the enterprise jointly designed a talent training plan, jointly formulated professional teaching standards, course standards, job standards, enterprise master standards, quality monitoring standards and corresponding implementation plans.
The pilot will take a training system as a pilot cycle. The internship time of students in enterprises is determined according to the professional talent training plan. The on-the-job internship is generally 6 months.
In enterprise practice, the enterprise group management model should be implemented, and according to the characteristics of different majors, one master can guide 2 to 5 apprentices to form a learning group to ensure that the students can skillfully master the skills required in each training post.
According to the arrangement, from 2016 to August 2019, the city will determine 60 municipal-level modern apprenticeship pilot projects in three batches, and each pilot project will have about 50 people, and a total of about 3,000 students (apprentices) will be trained.
According to the principle of first pilot and then implementation, from point to face, and gradually promote, we will explore the long-term mechanism of school-enterprise joint enrollment, joint training, and integrated education, and effectively improve the job skills of students, increase the employment rate and quality of students.

This vacuum cleaner has been considered for a long time, and finally decided to buy it. The vacuum effect is good. The dust in the house is obviously less. It is a bit heavy to hold with one hand. The wet mop needs to be improved. There will be dust marks when going back and forth. Overall, I am still very satisfied.
The cooking machine is quite heavy and looks high-end, which is suitable for me as a kitchen newbie. My child said it tastes better than my cooking. I have cooked two meat dishes and two vegetarian dishes, and the sweet and sour spare ribs are especially delicious. It takes a bit longer to cook, but the other dishes take a very short time. The noise is very small, so you don't have to worry about burning the food or not knowing how to cook!
After receiving the goods, I couldn't wait to cook three dishes at noon. Technology really changes life. The control of temperature and seasoning is so accurate, and the taste of the dishes is directly upgraded to the level of a chef. Not bad, it is an artifact for those who are not good at cooking. I recommend buying it!
I've added a new member to the kitchen.
A smart cooking machine, the kind that automatically adjusts the heat and automatically stir-fries.
No more fear of being scalded by hot oil, no more fear of over-cooking or under-cooking.
The stir-fried dishes were much better than mine, and the tomato and egg stir-fry was particularly tasty, and the egg had a particularly good texture.
It was a good buy.
The east and west are not bad, worth buying, very good
Overall it was very good, very clear and consistent with the description.
It's worth having.
The service is also very good.
The screen is large, clear, and easy on the eyes, and no other abnormalities have been found so far.

South African doctor: Although Omicron is highly contagious, it is mostly mild
Many doctors and medical experts in South Africa believe that the symptoms caused by the Omicron variant of the new coronavirus are milder than those caused by the Delta variant, although it spreads faster.
According to the Associated Press, as the omicron variant spreads in South Africa, a group of more than 5,000 doctors in the Gauteng province of South Africa reported that the symptoms of the current COVID-19 patients they are currently treating are relatively mild, such as body pain and cough, which are similar to the symptoms of the flu.
Dr Unben Pillay, the head of the organisation, says he sees dozens of patients every day but none have needed to be admitted to hospital.
Pyle said: "They can control the disease at home, and most people recover within 10 to 14 days of isolation. "
He said this includes the elderly and those with health problems, who are more likely to become seriously ill from COVID-19.
Compared to the last wave of Delta, he said, the COVID-19 patients he treated "had difficulty breathing and low blood oxygen levels.
Many people will be hospitalized within a few days."
In the two weeks since the Omicron variant was first reported in southern Africa, other doctors have also shared similar experiences.
Although it will take several weeks to collect enough data, the doctors' observations and early evidence provide some clues.
According to the summary of the South African National Institute of Communicable Diseases, only 30% of the newly hospitalized COVID-19 patients in recent weeks have severe symptoms, which is half of the proportion of severe cases in the previous wave of the epidemic; the average hospitalization time has been shortened from 8 days to 2.8 days; only 3% of the recent COVID-19 patients died, while the death rate was as high as 20% in the early outbreak of COVID-19 in South Africa.
"At the moment, almost all the indications are that this is a milder disease," said Willem Hanekom, director of the African Health Research Institute, citing data from the National Institute for Communicable Diseases and other reports.
He also said: "It's still early, and we need to get late-stage data.
In general, hospitalizations and deaths come later, and we've only been in this wave for two weeks. "
At the same time, scientists around the world are observing case numbers and hospitalizations, while testing the efficacy of current vaccines and treatments.
While Delta remains the predominant strain of COVID-19 around the world, Omicron cases are popping up in dozens of countries, with South Africa as the epicenter of the outbreak.
According to health officials, the number of new cases discovered in the first week of December in the province of Gauden has increased by 400%, and the test results show that more than 90% of the cases are caused by the Omicron variant.
Thanks to today's supporters, all 80 boxes were given out!

Education Commentary: What does it take to rescue kidnapped children?
If the famous public welfare slogan of “no buying, no killing” is compared, in a good environment without the demand for “trafficking”, group prevention and group governance, anti-trafficking for the whole people will make the trafficking behavior unprofitable, high risk and high cost, and this kind of crime will not occur again and again.
Recently, the missing child information emergency release platform developed by the Criminal Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security went online.
This is an Internet information platform created for the establishment of an authoritative channel for the release of missing children information and the timely recovery of abducted children.
When I heard the name of this app was "Reunion", I felt very warm.
The new technology not only has the name of "literature and art" and is full of feelings, but also uses information in an appropriate way, which is practical and effective.
The first goal of anti-trafficking law enforcement is to recover the abducted children and protect their personal safety and freedom.
Only after that is the trial and punishment of the suspect.
There are many "big words" to describe the meaning of criminal punishment, ranging from individual punishment, social prevention to legal education.
However, before the trafficking case is solved, the safety of the victims should be given priority.
Matters should be dealt with according to their importance and urgency. Under the urgent purpose of "rescue", controversial issues such as "whether child trafficking should be sentenced to death" can be put aside for the time being and discussed with caution; however, the matter of rescuing the trafficked children cannot wait.
According to the investigation experience of such cases, human traffickers tend to leave the crime scene as soon as possible after they succeed.
If the anti-kidnapping operation is delayed by one minute, the child may be one step further away from the parents, and the difficulty of solving the case will increase by one point.
In this case, taking effective measures such as the “Reunion” platform to help solve cases and find children is indeed a practical action.
After all, “anti-begging” is a big task that requires the whole legal system to work well.
To combat crime, protect the rights and interests of children and parents, from the improvement of legislation, to the protection of the judiciary, and to the meticulous law enforcement, all need to implement the care of "protecting the young and helping the weak".
In addition, the prevention of child trafficking can be done better from family to society.
For example, in a common case, a family of three rested at the train station. The parents fell asleep and when they woke up, they found that the child was missing.
You can't expect a two-year-old to have enough self-protection skills, but as a parent of a young child, you should at least have a protective awareness.
Parents taking turns to rest or placing their children in a safe environment are the minimum means to prevent children from being abducted.
On the other side of the police's crackdown on human trafficking crimes, those who buy trafficked children should also be paid attention to and punished.
A single illegal act is often just one link in a long chain.
According to the "Criminal Law" of our country, the minimum sentence for child trafficking is 5 years; in the case of particularly serious circumstances, it can be sentenced to death, and the property can be confiscated.
With the trend of “lenient sentencing”, the crime of trafficking in children is obviously a crime with heavier punishment.
There are still many trafficking cases every year.
It can be seen that some people have outdated ideas about raising children and have weak legal awareness.
Legal education for this group of people should keep pace.
To effectively control trafficking crimes, it is not enough to rely solely on official enforcement.
If the "kidnapping market" is widespread, the traffickers will be driven by their greed and constantly innovate the methods of kidnapping, which will form a "struggle" situation with law enforcement. Anti-trafficking actions will inevitably fall into an inefficient quagmire.
Therefore, breaking the backward ideas and popularizing legal knowledge can also help to eradicate the crime of buying and selling children.

The International Olive Oil Association divides olive oil into two main classes, virgin olive oil (Virgin Olive Oil) and refined olive oil (Lampante Olive Oil or Refined Olive Oil), and five levels.
First-pressed olive oil or natural olive oil is the oil obtained by mechanical cold-pressing and filtering of fresh olives to remove impurities.
It can be divided into three levels according to acidity:
Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO): This is the highest grade, highest quality olive oil and is a pure natural product.
The taste is excellent, with a faint and pleasant plant fragrance, and an acidity of no more than 1%.
Fine virgin olive oil (Fine Virgin): slightly higher acidity, but not more than 2%, with a pure and fragrant flavor.
Ordinary virgin olive oil (Ordinary Virgin): The flavor and taste are acceptable, with an acidity of no more than 3.3%.
Refined olive oil refers to the olive oil obtained by refining the first-pressed olive oil with an acidity of more than 3.3%, or becoming "secondary oil".
Refined olive oil comes in two grades:
Ordinary olive oil (Olive Oil): A mixture of refined olive oil and a certain proportion of virgin olive oil to balance the taste and color, its acidity is less than 1.5%, and it is a transparent light golden yellow.
Refined Olive Pomace Oil or Olive Pomace Oil (ROPO): This is olive oil obtained from olive pomace by solvent extraction and refined.
Having looked at the grading classification, you should have noticed that the acidity of olive oil is a very important indicator.
Like grapes used to make wine, different regions and varieties of olives produce olive oil with different standards.
The best place for olive trees to grow:
The Mediterranean coast has the most suitable soil, temperature, sunshine, air humidity and rainfall for the growth of olive trees.
Other regions can only plant sporadically in suitable areas outside of the Mediterranean coast.
Main production areas (Mediterranean):
Italy, Spain, Greece, Turkey, Portugal, Morocco, Syria, Israel, Tunisia, Algeria, Egypt, Pakistan, Lebanon, etc., as well as Argentina, Peru, South Africa, and other countries in the southern hemisphere with similar climates.
Harvesting month of the olive:
March to June is the time when the olive trees bloom and bear fruit. From July to October, the fruits begin to develop and mature, changing from green to red, purple, and finally black.
November to February is the season for picking the fruit (freshness of olive oil is very important).
Nutritional components of olive oil:
Olive oil is rich in a variety of monounsaturated fatty acids, including oleic acid and linoleic acid, as well as vitamins A, B, D, E, K, and antioxidants.
Olive oil is considered to be the most nutritionally suitable oil of all the oils found so far.
Democratic summit ends, with Biden saying the flame of freedom will never be extinguished
The online "Summit for Democracy" (Summit for Democracy) convened by US President Biden and attended by government leaders and civil society and private sector leaders from 110 countries around the world came to an end on Friday (December 10th).
In his closing remarks, Biden said that the fire of freedom burns in the hearts of people all over the world, and authoritarian governments will never be able to extinguish it.
He also said that he plans to hold the second global "democracy summit" next year.
On the second day of the summit, the Taiwanese government representative, Tang Feng, and the Hong Kong democracy and human rights activist, Nathan Law, who is currently in exile in the UK, also spoke.
Mr. Biden said: "We know how daunting the task before us is.
But we also know that we can meet the challenge as I have said before and as this summit has shown, democracy is everywhere in the world.
Dictatorships can never extinguish the tiny flame of freedom, which burns in the hearts of people all over the world. "
Biden also said that defending democracy needs the joint efforts of the whole society.
He said: "As leaders of the government, we have a duty to listen to our citizens, to strengthen the guardrails of democracy, to drive reform, to deliver transparent and accountable government, and to resist the forces of authoritarianism and those who would bare-facedly pursue power ahead of the public interest. "
The themes of the second day of the "Democratic Summit" are to defend human rights, consolidate democracy and resist authoritarianism, and resist digital authoritarianism and affirm democratic values.
This day coincides with the "International Human Rights Day".
United Nations Secretary-General Guterres also said in his opening remarks on the same day that the cause of democracy is facing challenges around the world, especially the challenges brought by emerging digital technologies.
He said: "Now is the time to reaffirm our shared values and positions as well as the resilience of democracy.
This requires deepening social dialogue, addressing inequalities, fighting corruption, renewing the social contract, investing in quality education, and expanding opportunities for women and girls.
This also requires us to resolutely condemn all forms of populism, nativism and extremism, including all the tools provided by the technological revolution. "
Hong Kong democracy and human rights activist Joshua Wong delivered a speech at the summit through a pre-recorded video, reminding the participants to continue to pay attention to the human rights situation of ethnic minorities in China, such as Hong Kong, Uyghurs and Tibetans.
He said: "For a long time, the world has been directly affected by China's rise, but no mechanism has been established to hold it accountable.
That is why politicians and civil society leaders must work together.
We must use everything we have (resources) to make sure that the revival of democracy is our top priority. "
Luo Guancong also called on the free world to unite to resist the threat of the Chinese Communist Party.
He said: "Perhaps some of you are afraid of offending President Xi Jinping, perhaps some of you do not want to lose the Chinese market, perhaps some of you have not realized the threat (of the Communist Party) to our democratic values.
And that's why we failed.
That's why we need to change. "
Tang Feng, a member of the Executive Yuan in Taiwan, attended the round table discussion on “combating digital autocracy and affirming democratic values” and released the “National Declaration” through video, emphasizing that Taiwan stands on the front line against autocracy and authoritarianism.
He also shared his experience on how to fight COVID-19 through information transparency and building mutual trust.
He said: "At a time when Taiwan's democracy is on the rise, we will always stand at the forefront of the global fight against authoritarianism, and play a leading role in promoting global freedom, democracy and human rights.
During the pandemic, authoritarian governments in different places have justified the infringement of human rights in the name of public health and collective interests, and the global democracy has shown signs of regression.
However, in Taiwan, we do not have to seal the city to control the epidemic, and we do not have to take down fake information. "
At the same time as the second day of the “Democracy Summit”, the U.S. Department of the Treasury announced that it would legally impose sanctions on 15 individuals and 10 entities from China, North Korea, and other countries that have been determined to have seriously violated human rights, and at the same time imposed investment restrictions on a Chinese company that has been determined to use surveillance technology to assist in the violation of human rights.
I've already taken a photo and sent it to you
I know.
But the restaurant didn't know why it kept pushing back the delivery time
It was originally going to be #NUMBER#.
In any case, I won't call
I won't eat anymore
I will make a complaint
Why didn't you speak up earlier if you couldn't deliver?
Waiting for you for so long
No, I didn't get the call
Please ask him to deliver it to our company again
I don't want to wait another #NUMBER# minutes
One meal took an hour and a half
#PRS_ORG# has not yet been delivered.
I would like to cancel my order
Why not cancel it?
Hello, the chicken sent by the restaurant is raw
I want to try tennis, but I'm afraid I can't stick with it. So I want to find a similar price to practice first.
Unfriendly, in fact, the price is often directly proportional to the degree of friendliness. If you can't distinguish, then the expensive normal situation will be more friendly than the cheap one, and this kind of "entry-level paddle" is actually industrial waste.
They are very low in intensity, the ball hits the racket and vibrates a lot, and the hard ball cannot withstand it. It is difficult for experts to control it.
The logic and subtext of their existence is this: Tennis is so difficult that they know you won't be able to learn it, and they also know that you won't be willing to buy an expensive one, so they give you a cheap one to fool you. Once you've played it twice, you won't play it again. This way, the racket is cheap, and you won't feel bad about it.
When you can really tell the good from the bad, it means you've improved, and then you can buy the expensive ones from me, and I'll make twice as much money.
It is recommended to spend a similar price to buy a slightly better second-hand racket, and choose Prince or Dunlop. These two brands are not well-known enough, so good rackets are not sold at a high price. A new racket for 500 or 600 is good enough, and a second-hand racket for 200. Wouldn't it be great to enjoy the experience of a thousand-dollar racket?
It is friendly to novices, but it is useless after the novice stage, but most people, especially girls, cannot pass the novice stage.
The order has been repeatedly delayed
Can you help follow up?
Postponed
Thank you
In other words, I already have credit?
Do I need to place a new order next? Do I need to ignore the previous order?

In fact, there are many things to pay attention to when dressing for girls with a slightly fat body.
Girls with fat bodies cannot wear skirts that are too short or too long. The length is about knee-length, just enough to cover the fat part of the thighs.
A skirt that is too short will expose the fat on your legs.
Too long will make you look short and fat.
If you wear a top, a skirt, and long socks in three different colors, it will look as if you have naturally grown taller.
In fact, many dark-colored clothes are the standard of slightly fat girls (the author has a deep understanding of this), and dark colors are also a good way to conceal your fat body. The noble and elegant black short skirt is also the first choice of slightly fat girls.
Wearing dark colors, especially black, will make you look thinner, especially if you wear a short skirt.
If your calves are thick, don't wear socks and shoes that call too much attention to them.
The more popular it is, the better, and the colors should not be too bright.
To prevent people from noticing your legs and feet and making you feel fat.
For slightly chubby girls, you must know the tricks of dressing well.
Plus-size girls should never wear tight mini-skirts. In addition, the top should not be too short or tucked into the skirt, which would make people feel very uncomfortable. If the legs are thick, you should wear black long stockings or mesh stockings (the kind with fine grids), choose a soft printed trumpet skirt and match it with a V-neck top, which can well cover the shortcomings of chubby girls.
Of course, there are also some things to pay attention to when a slightly chubby girl wears a short skirt.
If you wear a short skirt, you should choose a top with the same color as the short skirt, which will make your plump figure look taller.
Wearing a short skirt with high heels can make your legs look more slender, which is the most popular combination in summer!
If you have a fat upper body but thin legs, it is recommended to choose a gorgeous short dress.
It can not only cover your big belly, but also show your advantages.
The A-line skirt is very thin and more suitable for fat girls. The top should choose a tighter one to form a sense of hierarchy, which will be more thin.
The simple white T-shirt matched with a short skirt can also be tried by fat ladies.
Slightly fat girls can also wear a sense of fashion.
As long as they can master the rules of dressing and matching, slightly fat girls will also be the focus of everyone's attention.
After changing the way of dressing, we should also exercise more in life, and strive to get rid of the label of “slightly chubby girl” one day earlier 😄

Xinhuanet+ | Beijing Youth Ice Hockey League Ignites Winter Olympic Enthusiasm - Xinhua Net

The girl was used as a target to raise funds for her sister: "It's okay to think of it as a flesh wound" - Xinhua News
In Hangzhou Wulin Square, a girl stands in front of a large piece of wood with the words "human target, ten yuan per arrow" written on it.
Yesterday morning, a photo of "a Hangzhou girl willing to be 'a target' to raise money for her sister" went viral on social media.
The photo shows a girl standing in front of a piece of wood that is a little taller than a person. The words "human target, 10 yuan per shot" were written on the wood, indicating that passers-by can use a bow and arrow to shoot after paying.
This behavior aroused heated discussion among netizens.
Last night, the publicity officer of the Xiacheng Sub-bureau of Hangzhou Public Security Bureau confirmed to the New Beijing News reporter that the police confirmed that the girl had made such an extreme move for her sister's fundraising, but such behavior is not worth advocating. After being advised, the girl left the local police station yesterday.
Girl warned over street 'dartboard' fundraising
In the photo circulating on the Internet, a long-haired girl stood in a "character" shape in front of a large wooden board, and the words "human target, ten yuan per arrow" were written in black ink on the wooden board. There was another wooden board in front of her, on which her bank account and WeChat and Alipay accounts were written.
The image caused controversy when it was posted online.
Some netizens believe that this move is a "begging for attention", and many netizens sympathize with it.
“We found the situation around the square at around 10 a.m. on the 23rd. At that time, there were already a lot of onlookers. ”
When interviewed by local media, the police officers of Tianshui Police Station near the incident site said that there were two girls selling things, both of whom were around 20 years old and dressed in a youthful and beautiful manner.
The girl who was used as a "human target" was crying and asking passers-by to play the game; the other girl was helping to shout on the side, saying that her friend's sister had leukemia and urgently needed surgery fees, and asked everyone to help.
"We contacted the local police in Guizhou and learned that the girl was raising funds for her sister's leukemia treatment. "
Last night, the publicity director of the Xiacheng Branch of the Hangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau told the New Beijing News reporter that the girl's name was Ji Jiali, and she was raising funds for her sister, Ji Jiayan.
But due to the fact that treatment still costs more than 300,000, they could not think of a good way to raise funds, so they did such a thing.
He said that throughout the whole process, one of the girls was the target, and the other was responsible for assisting, but did not participate, and no one was found to shoot an arrow, but some people watched and took pictures and posted them on Weibo.
Later, the police, after identification by the public security department, determined that the bow and arrow used were not subject to control.
The official said, "It is not recommended to take this kind of eye-catching fundraising method".
She had left the police station after being warned by the police.
Heat dissipation: Good Thinness: Convenient Appearance material: Satisfied Acer has always been very cost-effective.
The new machine is very good.
The performance is stable and the cooling is no problem with the four air outlets. It is worth recommending.
This Acer Predator gaming laptop is pretty good. It is well-made and uses quality materials. It's a trustworthy brand!
The price of the Acer Shadow Knight Dragon is not expensive.
In my opinion, the Acer Predator Helios 300 is really good. The game effect: the game effect is comfortable, and you can play most games. My chicken dinner has a full high frame rate and is very smooth. LOL is not a problem, and CSGO can also handle it easily. Most AAA games can be played.
Heat dissipation effect: the heat dissipation effect is good, and the fan is powerful. It is quite quiet during work, and the game effect is not small when the fan is fully opened.
Appearance material: The appearance is pretty cool, and the game laptop is stylish. Display effect: The screen is very clear, and 1080 is enough to play games.
It's really good to buy a notebook. It's mainly used for design. It's very cost-effective. It's lighter than expected. It's also more beautiful than expected. The red on the buttocks is a very beautiful wine color. It's not so gaudy. The overall is much higher than expected. It's worth buying. It's also suitable for girls.

My friends around me also recommended them to buy this product!
I've already bought three machines in this series!
The appearance is beautiful, and the configuration is also good.
I bought it for my nephew, and I wanted to wait for the 418 bank event, but he needed it urgently, so I bought it in advance, so I missed the bank’s big event, which is a bit regretful.
However, the cost-performance ratio is quite high, and the logistics is quite fast. I will come back to write a review after using it for a period of time.
This is a brand-new, high-value-for-money gaming laptop. Its design style is very good, and it has already installed Windows 11 and Office 2019.
The display effect: I bought it for my child to do 3D rendering. The software has been installed. The child said that it can be used without any problems. This computer can be used for 3D design work.
He said it was good when I bought it for my son.

Not bad, the graphics of the game are really fragrant.
What was the hottest in 2021?
There is no doubt that it is the Tokyo Olympic Games.
Do you think only Olympic athletes can win awards?
Recently, the article "Check it out! Project managers can compete for gold medal in the Olympics" was very popular. It mentioned that in many projects, project managers can definitely take the lead and no one can match them: carrying bricks, going on business trips and staying up late are the daily routines of project managers, and putting out fires, taking responsibility and apologizing are even more common.
The article, which seems to be a joke, reveals the daily hardships of project managers, and behind it represents the inability to cope with the current project management work.
People engaged in project management work have also gradually chosen to take some actions to get themselves out of the predicament at work.
From the annual increase in the number of applicants for the PMP (international certification for project management professionals), it can be seen that more and more project management practitioners are improving their project management capabilities through learning.
According to the 20 Years Development Report of Project Management in China (1999-2019), as of September 2019, the total number of applicants for PMP® nationwide was close to 600,000, the number of people who passed PMP® certification was about 420,000, and the number of valid certificate holders was about 300,000, accounting for 31.2% of the total number of PMP® certificate holders worldwide.
In the past 10 years, the number of PMP certificate holders has been increasing year by year, which indicates that more and more project managers have realized that it is no longer appropriate to do things by simply copying the "old experience" in the past. The ever-changing working environment tells us that we should learn to stand on the shoulders of scientific giants to explore the way forward.
However, does passing the PMP guarantee a smooth project management process?
Many project management beginners said that through learning related courses such as PMP/IPMP, they can systematically master the relevant knowledge points such as the ten fields and five process groups of project management, but they are still confused when they really do project management work.
Many project managers often feedback the following problems: Project management cognition is not in place, simply relying on personal experience, having project management theory but not knowing how to put it into practice; Lack of systematic project management process support, unable to implement it in work, project estimation is inaccurate, control sensitivity is poor, and the project is dragged on and on; The division of labor is unclear, and the "old hands" in the team do not know how to deal with it; Cross-departmental assistance communication is not smooth, and the project is difficult to push forward...

Before the 12.12 Double 12 Festival, Jiexin advocated rational consumption for consumers - Economic Observer Network - A professional financial news website
This year’s “Double 11” shopping festival nationwide network payment business transaction amounted to 1.77 trillion yuan, setting a new high compared with previous years.
The various discounted red packets and the eye-catching live streaming of goods have once again made consumers shout that they have benefited from them. This wave of consumption fever, on the one hand, makes people sigh that the national consumption power is increasingly strong, and on the other hand, they have to calm down to think about the impact of consumerism on society and the contemporary mainstream consumer group.
On the eve of Double 12, Jiexin Consumer Finance Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as "Jiexin") issued a call for rational consumption, reminding users, especially young people, to establish good consumption awareness and consumption habits, and to refuse blind consumption and excessive consumption.
According to the results of the "Consumer Financial Literacy Investigation and Analysis Report" released by the People's Bank of China this year, the national consumer financial literacy index is 66.81, an increase of 2.04 compared with 2019.
Overall, residents in China have performed well on the level of financial consumption, but there are large differences in financial behavior and skills, and it is still necessary to further improve the level of basic financial knowledge.
The financial literacy level of the elderly and young people is relatively low, and "one old and one young" will still be the focus of continuous attention in financial education. According to the "China's Young People's Debt Status Report" released by Nielsen and the "2019-2020 China Youth Consumption Report" released by CCTV Finance, the younger generation has great consumption potential, and credit consumption has become an important path for consumption upgrading. 86.6% of young people are using credit products, and nearly half of them have no debt accumulation. Although the younger generation as a whole shows a rational consumption trend, which is contrary to the "excessive waste" label attached by the outside world, some young people do have excessive consumption and follow-up consumption behaviors, which have caused excessive financial pressure and debt risks, and even led to an increase in social problems. Financial enterprises should take the initiative to assume social responsibility and carry out positive guidance.
As a licensed consumer finance institution, Jiexin has always been committed to helping people build their own happy life with quality and considerate services, advocating consumers to establish a good and correct consumption concept, and actively responding to regulatory calls to enhance the rational consumption awareness of consumers, especially young people, with practical actions.
Over the past few years, CITIC has been carrying out all-round and diversified financial knowledge popularization activities for young people including college students, and through cooperation with top domestic universities, it has launched innovation practice competitions and other forms to subtly guide the consumption needs of young people, help them establish a rational consumption concept, reasonably plan their consumption needs, and thus help them accumulate life wealth.
On the occasion of Double 12, Jiexin reminds all consumer friends to establish a reasonable consumption awareness and correct monetary view, resist blind consumption and over-consumption, avoid consumption and loan errors, so as not to affect personal credit and future economic life.
When consuming, you must plan in advance and repay on time according to your ability.
If overdue, the overdue record will be recorded in the personal credit report, which may have a negative impact on economic life such as buying a car and buying a house in the future.
When enjoying financial products and services, it is also necessary to choose regular institutions and channels, and pay attention to checking whether the relevant institutions have the qualifications to operate.
In the future, Jiexin will continue to rely on its mature and reliable consumer finance system and constantly updated and iterated financial products to provide consumers with more demand-oriented and diversified services, and continue to help the public improve their financial knowledge level, help consumers cultivate the concept of rational consumption and moderate borrowing, and become a trusted consumer finance partner for consumers.

Vietnamnet - Gulf Cooperation Council to address common challenges
Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's stops included Oman, United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, Bahrain and Kuwait.
Notably, this is the first visit of the Crown Prince to Qatar since Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies imposed a blockade on Qatar in mid-2017, leading to the Gulf diplomatic crisis.
In this crisis, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt severed diplomatic relations with Qatar and imposed a comprehensive embargo on it, accusing Qatar of supporting terrorist organizations and having close relations with Iran.
Diplomatic tension has seriously affected the internal unity of the Gulf Cooperation Council, and has had a negative impact on the economies of countries in the region.
Four Arab nations have blocked all land, sea and air routes to Qatar.
The crisis was only resolved at the Gulf Cooperation Council summit in January 2021, when the Gulf states signed an agreement towards "reconciliation and stability" mediated by the United States and Kuwait.
Saudi Arabia has reopened its border with Qatar.
Saudi Arabia and Egypt are leading efforts to restore ties with Qatar by appointing new ambassadors to the country.
The Gulf Arab states have resolved their differences to restore ties with Qatar out of the need to unite for the benefit of their countries and regional stability to deal with common challenges.
During the visit of the Saudi crown prince to Oman, the two sides agreed to open the first direct land channel between the two Gulf neighbors.
The 725km-long channel connecting the two countries will provide convenient conditions for the travel of citizens of the two countries and the integration of supply chains.
The Saudi Public Investment Fund (PIF) will invest $5 billion in Oman, and 13 memoranda of understanding worth $30 billion have been signed between the two countries.
The Saudi crown prince's visit to the Gulf nations comes as Iran and the world's major powers negotiate to save the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), which has been condemned by Gulf Arab states for failing to address Iran's missile program.
The Gulf states have long regarded Iran as a long-term "competitor" and viewed Iran's nuclear program as a "threat" to regional security.
The Gulf states believe that it is flawed to not address the Iranian missile issue and not take action to contain Iran's activities in the region.
Against the backdrop of major powers' nuclear negotiations with Iran failing to meet the expectations of the Gulf States, Saudi Arabia and Iran held direct talks.
Its goal is to contain the escalation of tensions in the region.
This is one of the factors slowing economic growth in the Gulf Cooperation Council countries.
The upcoming GCC summit will be the first GCC summit since the dispute between some member states and Qatar ended.
This is an opportunity for the Gulf Cooperation Council to re-evaluate its diplomatic achievements in promoting the restoration of GCC unity, and to propose a series of measures to make its member states fully cooperate to address common challenges and make contributions to the stability and development of Gulf countries.

It is claimed that the exhaust sound of supercars in the New Mountain District is the loudest!
The car we bring to you this time is the dream of many men!
It is the flagship supercar of Lamborghini, the Murcielago's successor - the Aventador LP700-4!
The asking price is nearly two million ringgits, and the annual road tax is tens of thousands of ringgits. It has four-wheel drive, so why is it called the LP700?
With 700 horsepower, can you imagine how fast it can go?
Forget it, I don't know either. The data says that it only takes 2.9 seconds to accelerate from 0 to 100km/h. Well, when my myvi reaches 30km/h, it has already reached 100km/h.
The low-slung body, the arrogant scissor door, the huge air intake all over the body, and the 6.5 v12 engine that can be seen through the glass perfectly interpreted the style of Lamborghini.
There is no need to say too much about the car model. You can just Google it. Here are some explanations that Google may not provide!
It was too much attention. Wherever I went, everyone was looking at me. I was very uncomfortable! (In fact, it was a bit exciting.)
RM1 for 1km (the car owner doesn't care at all)
Practice getting on and off, or it'll be a bit awkward (because you won't be able to get out of the cabin and will get stuck halfway)
The engine is too loud, and you will become deaf as soon as you get off the car. (but it is very cool).
The car is too big, it will be too narrow to park in a normal parking space, and I'm afraid it will be hit when the car next door opens the door!
A little lonely, because there was no opponent on the road (I said it myself, it has nothing to do with the car owner, haha)
Don’t get it wrong, the supercar in the video is not for sale, sorry!
Friends who want to shoot videos for their beloved cars are welcome to contact us!
More car information that you don't know, can be found in The Car Guide / People's Car Guide.
It involved a million-dollar car accident!
It is believed that car friends are familiar with the Bugatti Chiron and the Porsche 911. The Chiron is one of the most expensive supercars in the world, and the price of the Porsche 911 is also at the million level!
A few days ago, a million-dollar Porsche 911 and a ten-million-dollar Bugatti Chiron were crashed within a few minutes abroad!
Judging from the results, you were right!
Let the university spirit and the spirit of the times resonate - Xinhua News
The so-called university spirit refers to a series of educational concepts and value pursuits formed by a university in the process of development, which is the soul of a university.
From ancient times to the present, the university spirit is of crucial importance to the development of politics, economy, culture, technology, society, and even the progress of a nation.
Since the birth of the first modern university in the world, universities have shouldered a unique mission different from other social organizations. For Chinese universities, which were born in the autumn of national crisis, its spirit is deeply influenced by traditional culture and changes of the times, advocating the value concept of "promoting virtue and benefiting the world, rectifying and governing the country" and the patriotic responsibility of "promoting education and strengthening the country".
Currently, the trend of informatization and internationalization of higher education is becoming increasingly obvious. Global education competition, technology competition and talent competition are intensifying. As an important "supply side", the structural reform of higher education is facing unprecedented opportunities and challenges.
In particular, the proposal of the Overall Plan for the Construction of World-class Universities and First-class Disciplines not only shows the confidence and determination of China to move from a big country in higher education to a strong country in higher education, but also puts forward higher and newer requirements for the development of universities.
How to make efforts to become one of the world’s most popular universities in a short period of time, and accelerate the construction of several world-class universities and a number of world-class disciplines, while still having a certain gap, to realize "overtaking on a bend"?
In addition to having firm confidence in goals, paths, and capabilities, universities should make full use of three advantages: First, the latecomer advantage, by continuously introducing outstanding academic talents from overseas, learning and drawing on the advanced experience of world-class universities, achieving a significant improvement in academic level and educational quality; second, cultural advantage, inheriting the wisdom content of Chinese civilization accumulated over five thousand years, promoting the development of excellent traditional culture, and using it to gather strength, shape brands, and improve images; third, system advantage, making use of the superiority of the socialist country's system, strengthening goal-driven, gathering consensus and joint forces, optimizing resource allocation, and providing a sustainable and solid guarantee for schools to accelerate the catch-up with the world's advanced level.
In particular, we must realize that it is impossible for all universities to be the same when building world-class universities. While each school plays to its strengths, it must also demonstrate its individuality and characteristics.
The school characteristics should not only have the common Chinese characteristics, but also reflect the unique goals, educational traditions and resource endowments of each school.
As for Zhejiang University, we focus on three aspects in our education. First, we emphasize the characteristics of cultivating innovative and entrepreneurial talents, build an integrated education and training environment for science and education, and industry-university cooperation, and form a complete chain of entrepreneurial education ecological system. Second, we emphasize the characteristics of interdisciplinary convergence, promote the optimization and adjustment of the discipline system, create an institutional environment of interdisciplinary convergence, and actively cultivate emerging interdisciplinary disciplines and landmark interdisciplinary achievements. Third, we emphasize the characteristics of the education system and social services, carry out in-depth international exchanges and cooperation, and accelerate the formation of a pan-Zhejiang production-study-research cooperation system.
In this process, it is especially important to always adhere to the spirit of the university and let the spirit of the university resonate with the spirit of the times.
For Zhejiang University, the school motto of "seeking truth and innovation", the common value of "diligence, virtue, insight, and honesty" and the common value of "embracing the river and the sea, opening up true and thick virtue, opening up the world and the people, and building our country" constitute the latest expression system of the spirit of Zhejiang University.
This is an important guarantee for the school to persist in the correct direction of education, continuously accumulate cultural heights, and condense spiritual power, which is rich in connotation and far-reaching in significance.
Among them, "Hai Na Jiang He" emphasizes the open and inclusive spirit, which embodies the mind of "using the world's talents", which is manifested in the quality concept of learning from the world's top universities; "Qi Zhen Hou De" emphasizes the spirit of seeking truth and goodness, which means that the university should not only pursue the truth, but also accept the cultivation of morality and the sharpening of personality; "Kai Wu Qian Min" embodies the spirit of reform and innovation, which not only includes the pursuit of new knowledge and the innovation of scientific research, but also manifests the reform and development, and the overthrow of the old and the new; "Shu Wo Bang Guo" emphasizes the spirit of patriotism and dedication, which means that the university should always share the same honor and disgrace with the national destiny.
This series of spiritual ideas and value pursuits is exactly the soul of Zhejiang University's 120 years of education.
"The wise listen to the silence, and the enlightened see the formless."
Chinese universities should further be based on the overall situation of the socialist cause in China, deeply grasp the era position and historical mission of higher education, and speed up the construction of world-class universities.
At the same time, it upholds humanistic care and independence and freedom, let the university spirit and the spirit of the times and the spirit of the nation collide with each other, so as to provide inexhaustible motivation for the realization of national prosperity and national rejuvenation, and the realization of the common ideal of mankind.

While the NFT is going out of the circle quickly, a new concept has emerged in the encrypted community.
In 2021, a blockchain game called "Axie Infinity" had a huge impact in Southeast Asia. Some residents who lost their jobs due to the epidemic began to obtain stable income in this game.
Axie Infinity is a pet-raising game based on blockchain technology. It combines multiple gameplay, including NFT, and is currently the highest trading NFT project, with a total transaction volume of more than 3 billion U.S. dollars.
Data from TokenTerminal shows that Axie Infinity's daily income has exceeded 8.2 million US dollars, close to that of Honor of Kings.
On August 6 this year, Axie Infinity announced that its daily active users had exceeded 1 million.
The popularity of "Axie Infinity" will bring a new "palytoearn" model to more people. With the help of blockchain and smart contracts, players will no longer be a single role. In addition to getting fun and economic benefits from the game, they can also participate in the governance of the game ecology.
This subjectivity is not granted by the game maker, but is guaranteed by blockchain technology.
When I saw the news about my friend’s stock price, my biggest feeling was the choice of enterprise on the track, that is, the choice of the industry of investment targets. First, choose an industry with large growth space, with a market size of at least 100 billion yuan; second, choose an industry with good future growth, and consider an industry that will reach the best growth state in 3-5 years; finally, choose an industry with policy support.
The width of the track refers to the size of the market, the length of the track refers to the development stage of the industry, and whether the track is flat or rugged refers to the competition pattern of the industry.
Cheers for the right track!
The first thing to do in the new year is to summarize 2021 and adjust the tactical layout in 2022.
The strategy is to "do the right things", that is, to do things right.
And the strategy is to "do the right thing", that is, to do the right thing.
The strategy is to find the direction, and the tactics are to implement it. There is space for strategic thinking above most tactical thinking.
For example, in addition to thinking about how to increase the number of customers (tactical thinking), one can think about whether to continue to deepen in the current field or expand to other fields (strategic thinking); in addition to thinking about how to increase the customer retention rate (tactical thinking), one can think about how to increase the retention rate of core customers and high-value customers (strategic thinking); in addition to thinking about how to increase the participation in activities (tactical thinking), one can consider how to set the correct activity KPIs to achieve the correct activity goals, such as increasing the participation of target customers, activating high-value silent customers, and accurately attracting new customers; in addition to thinking about how to increase DAU (tactical thinking), one can consider whether the current growth is healthy and sustainable.
Bitcoin, which was born 12 years ago, ushered in several milestone events in 2021.
On September 7th, the small Central American country of El Salvador will make Bitcoin a legal currency, which is the first time that Bitcoin has become the legal currency of a country or region.
On October 12, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved ProShares for the first time in eight years to launch a Bitcoin ETF and list it on the New York Stock Exchange, marking the landing of the first compliant Bitcoin futures ETF in the U.S. capital market and the further expansion of cryptocurrency investment exposure.
From the perspective of the development of blockchain technology, Bitcoin is not the protagonist.
On November 14, 2021, Bitcoin underwent a soft fork upgrade called "Taproot", which increased the anonymity of Bitcoin network transactions and reduced the data burden of transactions by changing the data structure of the block itself.

Three Ivy League schools, including Yale, accused of discrimination in admissions by Asian-American group - Xinhua News
Xinhua News Agency, Washington, May 23 (Reporter Xu Jianmei) On May 23, more than 130 Asian groups in the United States submitted a complaint to the U.S. Department of Education and the U.S. Department of Justice, protesting against the discrimination against Asian applicants in the admission process of three Ivy League schools - Yale University, Brown University, and Dartmouth College.
The Asian-American Education Alliance, which filed the complaint, held a press conference in Washington on the same day.
Zhao Yukun, the chairman of the group, said at the press conference that in the past 10 years, the number of Asian applicants meeting the admission conditions of American top universities has doubled, but the proportion of Asians in these three American top universities has basically remained at the same level.
Many studies have shown that these universities have been "systematically and persistently discriminating against Asian applicants" in the so-called "holistic" admission process.
Zhao Yukun introduced that a study by Sanders and other scholars in 2014 showed that among the three universities, Asians had the lowest admission rate relative to the number of applicants among all ethnic groups.
According to data from the U.S. Department of Education, among all the Ivy League schools, Brown University and Dartmouth College have the lowest acceptance rate for Asian students, and Yale University and Brown University have implemented de facto race quotas for Asian applicants for more than 20 years.
Zhao Yukun told Xinhua News Agency reporters that they hoped that the U.S. Department of Education and the Department of Justice would conduct an investigation after the appeal was submitted, and take measures to stop these universities from continuing to discriminate against Asians in admissions after determining the facts.
They also hope that the universities that have been complained will take the initiative to pay attention to this issue and change their admission policies for Asians.
At present, the three universities that have received complaints have not made any response.
The Asian American Education Alliance was founded in 2015. At that time, it had complained about Harvard University's admissions discrimination, but the U.S. Department of Education refused to accept it on procedural grounds.
In addition to the Chinese-American groups participating in the appeal, there were also Indian-American, Korean-American, Japanese-American, and Pakistani-American educational groups.

I just canceled an order
Why is it still in force
Can you check if it's been cancelled for me?
But I placed my order at 5:09 this morning.

Is there a telephone number to contact them directly?
In September 2020, Mr. Lu learned about a factory located in Zhangting Town, Yuyao, Zhejiang from a real estate agent. After several on-site inspections, Mr. Lu decided to purchase the factory.
In December of the same year, Mr. Lu discussed the details of the purchase of the factory building with Mr. Lin, the family member of the house owner. On the same day, Mr. Lu transferred 200,000 yuan to the bank account of the house owner as a deposit.
Lin signed as the recipient on the "Factory Purchase Deposit Receipt", which stated that "if the buyer does not want to buy this factory, the deposit will be returned to the seller, and if the seller does not want to sell this factory, the deposit will be doubled and returned to the seller. The two parties agreed to sign the factory purchase contract within a week."
However, the two sides were unable to reach an agreement on the main terms of the contract, such as the scope of the sale of the factory and the payment method, and the house purchase contract has not been signed.
Considering that the two parties failed to reach a consensus on the contract content, several days later, Mr. Lin returned the 200,000 yuan deposit to Mr. Lu.
After much effort, Mr. Lu finally found a house that he liked, paid the down payment, and prepared the money for the house. He was just about to sign the contract, but the seller refused to sell. This made Mr. Lu feel helpless and angry.
To this end, Mr. Lu sued Mr. Lin to the People's Court of Yuyao City.
After hearing the case, the court considered that the two parties eventually failed to sign a formal contract, which could not be solely attributed to the defendant. It should be reasonably assumed that the negotiations failed, so this case should not apply the penalty of the deposit. The defendant was not required to bear the breach of contract liability for the double return of the deposit.
After the first-instance judgment, the plaintiff appealed.
Recently, the court of second instance upheld the original verdict.
[The lawyer reminds you that] in the course of the transaction, it is necessary to fulfill the duty of due care.
When signing the contract, as a buyer, it is necessary to fulfill the necessary due diligence obligations, such as verifying the information of the property owner, whether the property is occupied, and clearly specifying the specific time and place of delivery in the contract to prevent disputes between the parties when performing the contract.
(German Voice Chinese Network) After the end of the "Democratic Summit" on Friday, the spokesperson of the Chinese Foreign Ministry issued a statement on Saturday (December 11), saying that the "Leaders' Summit on Democracy" held by the United States was "drawing ideological lines, turning democracy into a tool and a weapon, doing the opposite in the name of democracy, stirring up division and confrontation, and diverting domestic conflicts".
The Chinese government believes that "for a long time, the United States has imposed its own political system and value concepts on others, carried out "democratic reform", abused unilateral sanctions, instigated "color revolutions", and caused disastrous consequences.
"Democracy" has long been a "weapons of mass destruction" for the United States to interfere in other countries.
The summit is an action by Biden to fulfill his campaign promises.
The two-day meeting was held via video conference, with 111 global leaders invited to attend, including the leaders of Taiwan, but China and Russia were not invited.
On the eve of the summit, China and Russia criticized the United States for its own democratic problems, saying that the United States was not qualified to host such a summit.
There are also voices of doubt abroad and in the United States, for example, criticizing the invited leaders, including some leaders with authoritarian tendencies, such as the leaders of the Philippines, Poland and Brazil, and some people suspect that the true intention of the Biden administration is to organize this summit not for democracy but for geopolitical purposes.
Newly appointed German Chancellor Scholz also participated in the video democracy summit.
The statement of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Saturday said, "Today's American-style democracy is in a state of illness, and issues such as money politics, identity politics, party opposition, political polarization, social fragmentation, racial conflicts, and rich-poor divide are becoming more and more severe," and America's democracy is a "rich man's game" established on the foundation of capital.
U.S. President Joe Biden said in his speech that "as leaders of the government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, reinforce the guardrails of democracy, drive reform, achieve transparent accountability, and be better able to resist the forces of authoritarianism and those who seek power nakedly before the public interest. "
He stressed that democracy is not something that can be taken for granted, "We must constantly renew it in each generation. In my view, this is the defining challenge of our time. "
Biden also said that "at a time when democracies and human rights around the world are facing persistent and worrying challenges, democracy needs warriors to defend " .
The U.S. side promised that after the Democracy Summit, it will launch a one-year action plan, including a $424.4 million initiative to strengthen democracy around the world and support independent media.
The United States hopes that countries will make specific public commitments to improve their democratic systems before the in-person Democracy Summit, which is scheduled to be held at the end of 2022.
Biden said, "Let all countries implement our commitments and report the progress we have made next year."
OK, I'm just afraid that he sent it to the wrong address.

What is the Red Card Whisky drinking method?
Everyone has different hobbies. Some people like to collect things, some people like to eat, and of course some people like to taste wine. Red Label Whisky is one of the most popular Scotch whiskies in various countries at present, and Red Label Whisky has won a gold award in the International Spirits Competition.
Every bottle of Johnnie Walker has its own unique taste, but if you don't know how to enjoy it, it will be a waste of its mellowness.
Then, how do you drink the Red Label whisky?
Here is a simple introduction for you.
How to drink Red Label whisky:
The Johnnie Walker Red Label whisky is composed of more than 35 kinds of Scotch whisky. It has a strong aroma and the traditional characteristics of Scotch whisky. The strong aroma has a sweet and smoky flavor.
The entrance is rich and refreshing, with a slight hint of mint and a strong smoky malty flavor.
The wine can be enjoyed on its own over ice, or mixed with your favourite drink.
Red Label whisky has entered the domestic market, and in order to cater to the tastes of the Chinese people, Red Label whisky + Coca-Cola or Sprite or other carbonated drinks have become a long-lasting fashion.
These sweet drinks can not only neutralize the sour taste, but also bring visual pleasure, and can be added to drinks to dilute the alcohol and change the taste.
Red Label whisky + a slice of lemon + a lump of sugar (or granulated sugar) is the most authentic and traditional way to drink it.
The original Hongfangwei has a slightly bitter taste, adding sugar can neutralize the sourness, and the lemon will bring a refreshing fragrance to the wine. Of course, the sweetness and sourness can be adjusted according to individual taste preferences.
The above three are the best ways to drink red label whisky. Everyone can try them as a reference. I hope that my introduction can help you.
Educational thinking: How college entrance exams can benefit “smart kids” and “dumb kids” - Xinhua News Agency
Three Lanzhou Jiaotong University students wrote a letter to the school leaders, reflecting their confusion about university exams, and proposed to increase the difficulty of the exams, change the exam questions, and let the exams truly reflect the actual level of the students.
Indeed, the university entrance examination has been a "hot topic" for a long time.
In a university campus, students come from all over the world, have different capabilities, and have different levels of study, resulting in a variety of learning situations.
It is inevitable that there will be different feelings when it comes to assessing a group with so many different characteristics.
Of course, if the examination questions are of a single type and have a high repetition rate, and the questions are too simple, it will inevitably cause another completely different feeling.
Students who do not study may be able to pass by cramming right before the exam, and if they try other methods, they may be able to achieve twice the result with half the effort.
As a result, there are "underachievers" who can pass the exam without effort, and even get high scores; and there are "overachievers" who never skip classes, have good homework and notes, and don't score much higher than others.
It can be seen that the problems reflected by Lanzhou Jiaotong University students in university exams are not groundless. It is believed that this situation does not only exist in Lanzhou Jiaotong University.
In this sense, we should applaud the three students who wrote the letter.
In fact, those who have been to university are well aware of the fact that it is not uncommon for people to cram for exams and try all sorts of means to “extract” exam questions from teachers, in the hope of narrowing the scope of the exam and getting “special attention” from teachers before the exam. It is not unusual for people to smuggle cheat sheets into the exam or ask teachers for help after the exam.
In my opinion, as a kind of teaching quality assessment guide, whether a university's examination is qualified or not is more about teachers' comprehensive grasp of teaching and learning, and the scientific proposition on this basis.
When entering the university undergraduate stage, the major begins to be subdivided, and many professional courses are mainly based on basic knowledge.
There is no doubt that whether or not one has a complete grasp of the basic knowledge points of a subject is what university exams examine.
Undergraduate knowledge is basically the basic theory and common sense of disciplines. In terms of knowledge points, the space for change is not large, and it is basically fixed.
Just as some teachers said, "The basic knowledge of university mathematics 20 years ago is still being learned, and it is still the focus. "
But the knowledge points are basically unchanged, which does not mean that the exam questions are single and the questions are repeated.
In many universities, exams are generally composed of the question-setting group, and then the senior teachers of the subject are in charge of the composition of the test paper, and the exam marking is also participated by all the teachers in charge of the subject, so as to overcome the situation of repeated questions to a certain extent.
However, in order to formulate a set of test papers that are in line with the actual teaching and learning, the difficulty of the questions should be normally distributed according to the overall learning situation of the students, and the teaching situation should be comprehensively mastered and the students' learning level should be fully analyzed, so as to dynamically grasp the difficulty and type of the examination, so as to highlight the basic knowledge examination, take into account the ability examination, and innovate the design of the type of questions at the same time.
The exam is the baton of university education, and students will have corresponding study plans according to the type of exam. This will affect the effectiveness of university education in the long run.
Lanzhou Jiaotong University attaches great importance to the suggestions of the students, and has deployed a rectification plan in the whole school.
Require all teaching units to organize teachers to carry out seminars and self-examination of course final examination, formulate examination question setting and related systems, and at the same time strengthen the supervision and inspection of examination question setting and review links, refine the evaluation of scores, and strengthen the comprehensive assessment of all links of course teaching.
To solve the problem of single types of questions and repeated questions from a mechanism point of view is an issue that university exam affairs need to face. Of course, it is necessary to introduce corresponding systems, but the key is in daily work. Teachers need to have a comprehensive grasp of the teaching situation. Not only do they need to understand the teaching content, but they also need to understand the students' learning situation. Both ends need to be understood. The teaching and learning will be better matched, and a positive interaction will be formed. The exam will also be more in line with the actual situation, thus allowing the "top students" and "bottom students" to get what they deserve.

Mrs. Kim's Wedding Photography (South Street store) has no branches for the time being.
Before the photo shoot, we had to change the time twice because we hadn't arranged our time well. Our advisor, Lanlan, was very patient and arranged the time for us.
It was taken on a sunny weekend later.
The staff at Mrs. Kim's, whether it be the consultants, makeup artists, or photographers, are all top-notch.
It was my first time doing proper make-up, wow! I couldn't believe that one day I would look so good, haha.
Xiaojie and another girl (I'm sorry, I can't remember her name) were very patient with the makeup, and the makeup was very natural.
The outdoor shots were taken in Jiangwan City. Fortunately, the weather was good that day. We didn't feel very cold. The makeup artist would pay attention to our clothes and headwear from time to time when taking photos. If anything was slightly wrong, they would help us fix it immediately.
The photographer was also very humorous, and I felt very happy after taking pictures all day.
When choosing photos, because I have seen many cases online, I don't want to let the guests delete too many photos. However, when we chose photos, we really didn't mean to add photos. We didn't add any of the 24 photos in the set (I heard that my cousin, who took wedding photos around the same time as me, had a package of more than 7,000 and added more than 10,000 photos. At that time, I was stunned. I was also very afraid that I would choose too many)
The photos were repaired today. Lanlan sent them to me. I looked at two of them and thought they were not good. They immediately helped me to repair them again.
When I compared my sister's previous photos, I found that I was really satisfied with our photos. They were simple and refreshing, just the style I wanted.
I sincerely recommend everyone to take wedding photos in Xuanhan Jinfu!
Package price: RMB 3,999
Mrs. Kim is grateful for your sincere wishes for her happiness, well-being and a bright future!

3,200 newborn babies in Sabah have no birth certificates due to a shortage of anti-counterfeiting paper
(Kota Kinabalu, 11th) The Sabah National Registration Department said that due to the shortage of special anti-counterfeiting paper, it has not been able to issue birth certificates to newborns since the beginning of October, and the cumulative number of affected people has reached 3,200.
However, the director of the bureau, Keruaminus, assured that all the information of babies who have already applied for birth certificates has been recorded in the system, and will be reissued after the anti-counterfeiting paper is delivered next week.
He explained at the press conference, in response to a report by a web media, that the Sabah newspaper was printed on paper for more than 10 months.
He said the problem has been there for the past two months and Sarawak is facing the same problem.
"One of the reasons is that the Chinese manufacturer that produces special anti-counterfeiting paper has been affected by the epidemic, resulting in a delay in delivery to our country. "
He explained that the security paper used by Sabah Times was different from other regions, so he could not borrow stock from other states.
Keruak revealed that the latest batch of anti-counterfeiting paper arrived in Kuala Lumpur on the 6th of this month and was delivered to the printing company on the 8th for part of the printing work.
"The department will send people to Kuala Lumpur to pick up the goods next Thursday, return to Sabah for the final stage of printing, and it is estimated that it will be handed over to the applicant two working days later (December 20). "
"We will notify the applicants to pick up the birth certificate at the local police station. "
He added that Sabah has issued a total of 24,801 birth certificates so far this year.

It is super convenient, just like opening it on the computer, and it solved my problem of insufficient computer hard disk space.
The newly arrived solid-state mobile hard drive cannot be read by the computer, and the computer does not recognize the solid-state mobile hard drive, while the computer can read the U disk.
The machine is very light in hand, and the appearance is atmospheric and beautiful.
I used it for the whole afternoon today. The heat dissipation was very good, and it was basically not hot. The running speed was very fast, and it killed 99% of users at startup.
The battery is also very strong, with a standby time of 9 hours, and 4 hours of use should not be a problem. All in all, I feel very happy to buy a machine of this quality at this price. Other functions will be added later.
It looks pretty good.
In terms of performance, I will comment after using it for a period of time.
The machine is fast, bigger than expected, and the rendering effect is great. I like it. I will review it after using it for some time.
Not bad, the serial number of this machine can be found on the Hong Kong website, and the quality should be OK.
**It doesn't feel big, it feels heavy, it can't be held in one hand, it's not actually big, it's a little bit bigger than 15.6 inches. It runs very stably and doesn't feel stuck. I love the sound of the fan's cooling, it has a sense of feeling, and it doesn't spin all the time like a gaming laptop.
The things are not bad, much cheaper than the official flagship store, and they gave me a backpack. I think it's pretty good.
The store's service is also good, reminding me to update the bios, and issued the ** in a timely manner.
It's worth it!
Heat dissipation performance: The heat dissipation is very good, with almost no heat. Slimness: Convenient to carry. Appearance material: The traditional design of Thinkpad is satisfactory.
A reputable seller, a careful inspection of the appearance of the whole machine, all the interfaces, no traces of refurbishment or use, it is indeed a brand-new American version machine, and the configuration is the same as the page.
I forgot to send the backpack, and immediately help me to send a backpack, although it is not a standard original factory backpack, but in terms of follow-up service, it is enough to prove that it is a conscientious seller.
If your friends need to buy a laptop, you can buy it back.
Appearance material: The appearance is atmospheric. Display effect: The screen resolution is OK, clear, and the thinness: It has a good texture, after all, the heavier the thing feels better.
Heat dissipation effect: I will evaluate it later.
The keyboard is pretty good, and it comes with a mouse and converter. This configuration is very cost-effective compared to the domestic version. Overall, it's pretty good value for money. As for the performance of the machine, I'll evaluate it after using it for a while.
This screen is really comfortable!
It is very easy to use, and I will review it after using it for a period of time!
Education information: Beijing has compressed the ratio of special students admitted to junior high school at the beginning of 2016 - Xinhua News

48-hour negative nucleic acid test, set up "buffer zone" The State Council’s joint prevention and control mechanism issued a document requiring the strengthening of epidemic prevention and control in port cities - Xinhua Net
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 11 (Reporters Dong Ruifeng and Gu Tiancheng) The State Council’s Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism recently issued a notice on strengthening the prevention and control of the new coronary pneumonia epidemic in port cities, requiring people who have recently left the land border port cities (except those connected to Hong Kong and Macau) to hold a negative nucleic acid test certificate within 48 hours, and those who go to the land border port cities must undergo at least one nucleic acid test after arrival.
According to the notice, the above-mentioned requirements are within the time range from the date of determination and announcement of the port city range in each province, region and city to March 15, 2022.
In addition, the notice also proposed that conditional port cities can study the establishment of epidemic prevention and control buffer zones within their jurisdiction.
A relevant person in charge of the Disease Prevention and Control Bureau of the National Health and Health Commission introduced that for some port cities, cross-border border trade is the main economic pillar of the local area, and the two sides of the border have frequent exchanges.
It is expected to achieve the effect of moving the control point forward, compress the risk of epidemic spillover, and achieve the maximum effect of epidemic prevention and control with the least social impact and the lowest social cost.
Recently, there have been a number of local cluster epidemics in our country, all of which were imported from overseas through port cities.
The above notice pointed out that this exposed some problems such as untimely epidemic monitoring and early warning in some places, non-implementation of closed-loop management of high-risk personnel, routine nucleic acid testing being merely formal, inadequate disinfection at each link of cold-chain items, non-standard management of centralized isolation places, and lack of scientific and precise emergency response to the epidemic.
The notice required that efforts be made in nine aspects such as perfecting the epidemic prevention and control mechanism of port cities, perfecting the epidemic monitoring and early warning system, and implementing border control measures, to speed up the completion of the prevention and control shortcomings of port cities, do the prevention and control work without relaxation, scientifically and accurately, and weave a tight line of defense against imported cases.
The notice emphasizes that each port city should synchronize the research and deployment of the prevention and control of the epidemic with the protection of people's livelihood, publish and open the hotline of people's livelihood protection, regularly inspect the signs and hidden dangers of the supply of basic living materials and prices, and promptly solve and actively respond to the prominent issues reflected by the masses.
According to the notice, the port cities referred to include the counties (cities, districts, banners) where open land, water, and air ports are located, the cities (prefectures, states, leagues) where they are located, and the directly administered cities, with the specific range to be determined and announced in a timely manner by each province (autonomous region, directly administered city) according to the needs of epidemic prevention and control.

Tube video reveals the truth of the U.S. military's 20-year bloodthirsty killing-Xinhua News
(Video Source: YouTube)
On December 11, a micro-documentary named "Killing Machines" on YouTube attracted wide attention.
The film tells the story of the United States launching the Afghanistan war in the name of "anti-terrorism" and forcibly exporting American-style democracy through war, and committing various crimes against humanity in 20 years of war, bloody violence, killing innocent people, and committing various crimes against humanity.
Abusing drones to carry out airstrikes on civilian places such as hospitals and schools, distorting human nature, and establishing a murder group.
In the past 20 years, the U.S. military has killed tens of thousands of innocent Afghan civilians.
The US military set up a “black prison” to torture and humiliate “suspects”.
A series of crimes against humanity has aroused more hatred among the Afghan people.
As the video says, the American "anti-terrorist" war is "the more anti, the more terror".
The war has not brought peace and democracy, prosperity and hope to the Afghan people, but only a devastated country and countless killings and destructions.
Click on the video, and let's uncover the truth of the U.S.'s bloody slaughter in the name of "anti-terrorism", and expose the hypocrisy of American democracy!
By chance, I saw an article as follows. From the perspective of business and shelf life, it talked about why the logistics company in the bonded zone helped the customer do canning. Although canning belongs to deep processing, it is not within the scope of business of the bonded logistics company. The following text may explain why the customer wants to do so?
I went to many powdered milk factories and contacted many powdered milk production lines.
In fact, the raw materials of bagged and tinned milk powder are exactly the same, and there is no difference.
Then everyone must have asked: why is the shelf life of the bagged one year, while the shelf life of the canned one is two years or longer?
Or ask again: why is there such a big price difference between hearing and bagging?
In fact, from this point of view, many consumers, or mothers, think that this is because the raw materials are different, so the quality will be much better.
In fact, the raw materials are the same. People just think that the more expensive it is, the better it is.
There are also consumers who eat it with this mentality. After eating it, they say that the taste or flavor of the packaging is different!
Now let me tell you first why it is expensive to listen. Where is it expensive?
Why is there such a big price difference when their raw materials are the same?
Because when the manufacturer sets the price, most of them consider that if the bagged price is too high, it will be difficult for consumers to accept, which means that the profit generated by the manufacturer is very low, or even no profit, then how can the manufacturer survive?
So they have a large increase in the list price to safeguard their profit space.
Therefore, most manufacturers mainly promote the ready-to-eat products rather than the bagged products.
Not to mention, so many manufacturers have to spend tens of millions or even hundreds of millions on advertising every year. Where does this cost come from?
Needless to say.
With the development of society, the cost of market promotion, such as the cost of promotional staff in shopping malls, the cost of display in shopping malls, the cost of gifts for products, advertising costs, etc. are also constantly increasing.
Therefore, each manufacturer is also constantly increasing new products, and it is listening to the installation, and its price is also constantly rising. In fact, this is a new product produced by the increase in market costs.
The main purpose is to obtain higher profits. In fact, the cost of their raw materials will not exceed 3 or 4 yuan at most.
There are also some brands that will resort to any means to promote their products, and hook up with doctors in hospitals to assist in the promotion of products, earning profits ranging from 30 yuan to 80 yuan.
However, the relevant laws in China absolutely do not allow such operation methods. In fact, this kind of practice is cheating consumers.
It is recommended that you buy a bag of milk powder and put it in the can at home. This can save money and increase the preservation and sealing of the milk powder, and have no effect on children.
Also, do not think that the shelf life of a bag of rice is longer than that of a bag of rice. If the shelf life of a bag of rice and a bag of rice is the same after opening, it just means that the bag of rice is not easy to save after opening, and it is prone to moisture and deterioration.
The delivery was late, the food was cold, and after being cold, it was dry and hard and completely inedible.

Don't scare people at the starting line - Xinhua News
When visiting a book fair, you can often feel the popularity of books on success.
Many of today's self-help books preach the "best principle" - that is, first assume or suggest that you can "do it," and then tell you what it is that you need to do.
In other words, it has skipped over the most important and fundamental step of "how to do it" all at once.
This is why these books all have one thing in common - either give it your all and do your best, or don't do anything at all; either it's 100%, or it's 0%; either you climb Mount Tai, or you just stay where you are.
This "best principle" makes everyone admit that it is "right beyond doubt", but 99% of people will be frightened before the starting line.
Because this theory advocates a path of "you have to make up your mind and start over with a 180-degree change," which is exactly the fatal weakness of many people.
For those who are conservative, follow the old rules, and refuse to change, if you shout "You need to change" in their ears, it is undoubtedly self-deception and playing the piano to a cow.
Most people will hesitate in the face of the word "transformation", hesitate and fail to make a decision; or make a decision based on a moment's impulse, and bravely take the first step, but it is often short-lived, and it is difficult to last for a long time.
Mr. Ma Sanli's famous cross-talk "Starting from tomorrow" is a classic that best reflects this "universal human nature".
The biggest problem with the "best principle" is that the threshold is too high. It often exceeds the limits of ordinary people's abilities, and makes most people "sigh in despair".
Maybe, the "second-best principle" is a way for more ordinary people to walk on the path of relative success.
The core of the "next best principle" lies in "lowering the threshold" - it encourages a theory of "accumulating small wins into big wins", that is, if you can't do 100, just do 1: because 1 is always greater than 0; if you can't climb Mount Tai, just climb the small sand dune at your doorstep: because that is always better than standing still.
At the end of the day, doing something is always better than doing nothing.
Since the threshold has been significantly lowered, it has become possible for ordinary people to persist, and the probability of success will increase as long as they persist.
The path to success following the "second-best principle" is just a little longer.
In short, "the best principle" although it sounds like a banner for everyone to succeed, it ultimately can only motivate a few, while "the next best principle" can effectively motivate more people and benefit more people as much as possible.

The amount of Qinghai Lake naked carp resources increased by 0.71 thousand tons this year - Xinhua News Agency
Xinhua News Agency, Xining, December 11 (Reporters Luo Xiaofei and Zhang Hongxiang) The reporters learned from the Qinghai Provincial Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs that the latest monitoring results showed that the resource reserves of naked carp in Qinghai Lake increased by 7,100 tons this year compared with last year, reaching 108,500 tons. Compared with the beginning of protection in 2002, it has increased by more than 40 times cumulatively.
The naked carp in Qinghai Lake, also known as "Huan fish", is a unique and precious fish species in Qinghai Lake. It plays an important role in maintaining the safety and biodiversity of the "water-fish-bird" ecological chain in the Qinghai Lake basin.
In the 60s and 70s of the 20th century, under the influence of factors such as large-scale human hunting and the deterioration of the breeding environment of naked carp, the number of naked carp in Qinghai Lake decreased sharply, and the resource reserves of naked carp in Qinghai Lake were only 2592 tons in 2002.
In 2004, Qinghai Lake naked carp was listed as an endangered species in the Red List of Chinese Species.
Since 2003, Qinghai Province has implemented lake closure for fish breeding, prohibiting any units, collectives and individuals from catching naked carp in Qinghai Lake and its main rivers and tributaries, and prohibiting the sale of naked carp and its products.
At the same time, through artificial breeding and release, as well as cleaning the main river channels of Qinghai Lake and designing scientific and reasonable "fish passage", the resource reserves of Qinghai Lake naked carp are increasing year by year.
Yang Lin, Deputy Director of Qinghai Provincial Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, introduced that as of now, a total of nearly 180 million naked carps have been artificially propagated and released in Qinghai Lake, contributing more than 23% to the restoration of naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake.
The Sanjiangyuan region of Qinghai is an important ecological barrier and water conservation area in China and even Asia, while Qinghai Lake is a natural barrier and ecological functional zone that controls the eastward expansion of western desertification.
In order to protect the ecological environment of the Three Rivers Source Region and Qinghai Lake and protect aquatic wild animals, and maintain the biodiversity of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, Qinghai has successively issued fishing bans for the Yangtze River, the Yellow River, and the Qinghai Lake, and built a comprehensive fishing ban management system of "one river, one river, and one lake".

It's been an hour and it hasn't been delivered yet
I just saw an article about a fake case, which was too long.
For those men who don't know, here's a little education.
Most girls experience their first period one day between the ages of 13 and 15, and go through menopause around the age of 50.
If you are in good health, it will be more regular to come once a month.
But it is not regular enough to make an accurate prediction, with a tolerance of about one week, so you need to be prepared in advance. Sometimes, if you are not lucky, it will be overturned (suddenly advanced for a few days).
The length of time, the amount of blood, the severity of cramps vary from person to person. Some people have it for three days, some people have it for a week; some people have light bleeding, some people have heavy periods; some people have no reaction, some people are in so much pain that they need to be taken away in an ambulance. Menstrual cramps can change over time, just because it wasn't painful before doesn't mean it won't be painful for the rest of your life.
Periods are out of control, bleeding 24 hours a day from start to finish, and all you can do is use sanitary pads or tampons to suck up the blood to prevent it from getting on your clothes or chairs.
Menstrual cramps are mainly caused by the secretion of prostaglandin. Taking ibuprofen at the beginning of menstruation can effectively relieve the pain of that month, but it is useless to take it after the menstrual cramps begin.
Before the menstrual period, due to the congestion of the uterus and excessive release of prostaglandin, it is easy to have diarrhea.
If you are around the time of your cycle and have a sudden bout of diarrhea, your period will most likely come within two days.
It is best to change sanitary pads every two or three hours, otherwise it is easy to breed bacteria. Excluding sleep time, the worst case is to change 6 times a day, 7 days a month, that is 42 pieces. If you add the pieces prepared in advance, there may be 50 pieces, which is not one piece per month.
(Here's an edit, sanitary napkins don't need to be changed often. You can change them every five or six hours. The longest time is eight hours.)
Hormones during the menstrual cycle can make you more irritable, and the ovulation period can cause emotional instability due to changes in the body's hormones, which is very unlucky, and the body makes things difficult for you.
However, the official crime rate data shows that women's ability to control their emotions is still very high, and they will not use emotional issues as an excuse.
The flow is not just blood, it also includes shed uterine lining.
The endometrium is the thinnest after the end of menstruation, and then gradually thickens. It can be understood that the uterus is a house. Every month, a house is built (the endometrium thickens) to prepare to welcome guests. If the guests do not come, it will all be demolished (menstruation is discharged) and a new house will be built next month.
It is very inconvenient to have a period. For several decades, there will be a few days of 24-hour bleeding every month, and there will also be abdominal pain and lower back pain. Who would like it?
However, people can be born because their mother had her period, which was to prepare a 10-month house for you when you first came to this world, everyone should thank their mother for having regular and healthy periods.
In the past, many things about women were suppressed, and society brainwashed women into thinking that it was dirty, shameful, and that's just how it was, but times have changed.
If anyone thinks that menstruation is disgusting, and thinks that the preparation of a woman's body for the birth of life is disgusting, they should not say it in public. Girls, stand up and don't think like that anymore. Men who have never experienced it, will never experience it in their lifetime, and don't know much about it, should not be so ungrateful and ignorant. How can they dare to face their own mothers with such an attitude? How can they dare to want their own children?
Finally, give the sanitary pads a try, they are really useful.
Today is the Winter Solstice, and the wrong gift is disappointing
We have to order extra meals for the children to eat.
I hope that shops will check their products even when they are busy
Is it an electric shock when you soak your feet in a foot bath?
Choosing the right foot bath can have a good foot care and health care effect. Today, the editor of Gome will answer this question. I hope it will be helpful to friends.
As people's awareness of health care increases, foot baths are becoming more and more popular among consumers, and a large number of products of different grades have emerged in the market. From more than 100 yuan to more than 1,000 yuan, there is a wide range of choices for consumers.
On the surface of relevant data, compared with traditional home appliances, the sales of health care home appliances such as foot baths are booming, but foot baths do not have specific industry standards, so there are certain safety hazards.
"It's really dangerous to soak your feet in electric water!"
Mr. Li told the reporters that recently, he bought a foot bath for his father as a birthday gift. However, his father felt numbness in his feet when he soaked his feet.
At first, Mr. Li thought it was caused by the vibration function of the foot bath, but he didn't expect that even after turning off the vibration function, his father still felt numbness in his feet.
Mr. Li used an electric pen to test, and the electric pen actually lit up. Mr. Li was surprised to find that the water in the foot bath was actually electrified.
Later, he contacted the merchant, and the merchant’s attitude was not bad, but Mr. Li still felt unhappy even though he had returned the foot bath.
He found that there was no clear and detailed industry regulation on the highest temperature setting, the target group, and the material ensuring harmlessness of the foot bath basin, which has been popular for a long time.
But in general, foot bath tubs do not have the problem of electricity, but it is not ruled out that some products are not strictly controlled before leaving the factory.
Therefore, when buying, choose a separate foot bath.
The separation of water and electricity does not pose any safety risks.
At the same time, you can test it with an electric pen.
The 13th Provincial Tea Expo opened - Headlines - Hunan Daily Net - Huasheng Online
Hunan Daily News on December 10th (all-media reporter Zhang Shangwu, Hu Panyan, correspondent Liu Xiaoling, photographer Li Jian) Today in the morning, the 13th Hunan Tea Industry Expo was held at the Hunan International Convention and Exhibition Center to showcase the tea industry, innovate tea technology, promote tea culture, and speed up the pursuit of the trillion-dollar tea industry target.
Hou Shunli, Deputy Director of the Board of Directors of the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives, and Ye Hong, Deputy Director of the Standing Committee of the Provincial People's Congress, attended the opening ceremony.
At the opening ceremony, Professor Liu Zhonghua, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, solemnly introduced that the source of Lake Hong is in Xinhua, and the rise of red tea injects new momentum into the "five-colored Xiang tea".
In recent years, the Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial Government have vigorously supported the development of the tea industry, promoted the construction of the 100 billion yuan Xiang tea industry, and formed the development pattern of “Three Xiang, Four Waters and Five Colors Tea”.
The tea industry in the province has increased its innovation. Green tea, black tea and red tea and other main tea varieties are taking turns to make efforts, and the main tea-producing areas are promoting the integration of tea and tourism, driving the majority of tea farmers to increase their income.
Fengshui is constantly changing, and red tea is making a comeback.
Experts in the tea industry in the province said that after harvesting green tea, red tea and black tea, tea farmers have income all year round, and the output value of tea gardens is on the rise.
At the opening ceremony, the provincial leaders awarded certificates to the fourth batch of enterprises authorized to use the “Hunan Red Tea” trademark. Xinzhou held the “Hunan Red Tea Source”.
At the Newhua Red Tea Museum, Fujian tea merchants spotted a high mountain tea called “Bingli Chun” and immediately placed an order.
The Secretary-General of the Provincial Tea Association, Wang Zhun, said happily that the current epidemic and other factors have more or less affected the tea market, but from the scene of the tea fair, there are many bright spots.
The new-style red tea is a touch of red, infusing the connotation of tea culture. The popularity is strong and the trade is hot. The Xiang tea industry welcomes a new spring.
If these foods are not hot, can they be cancelled?
I don't want it, he couldn't bring it up because there was no place to park down below
Metaphysics is the study of questions that cannot be answered through perception, using rational reasoning and logic.
Metaphysics is the fundamental principle of philosophy, aiming to explain the basic nature of existence and the world.
The Chinese translation "Metaphysics" is derived from the phrase "形而上者谓之道，形而下者谓之器" in "易经•系辞上传", which was translated from "metaphysic" by Japanese scholar Tetsujiro Inoue in the Meiji period.
The branches of metaphysics include ontology, natural theology, and related issues.
Ontology is "the study of which words represent real existing entities and which words only represent a concept."
Metaphysical naturalism refers to the denial of the existence of God.
Its theoretical basis is that all phenomena can be explained by the concept of natural reason, proposed by philosophers who support science and evolution theory.
Methodological naturalism, on the other hand, refers to a method of research that makes no reference to God.
The philosophy of mind is the branch of philosophy that studies the nature of consciousness and its relation to the body, especially the brain.
Dualism and monism are the two main schools of thought when discussing the relationship between the mind and the body.
Epistemology is a branch of philosophy that deals with the nature, origin, and scope of knowledge.
Ethics is the systematic study of human moral life; here, morality is defined as all of the rules of behavior recognized by a group of people or a culture.
Mainly divided into meta-ethics (abstractly study the nature of ethical theories or criticism), and normative ethics (judge various different moral views, and give moral guidelines for right or wrong behavior.
It studies what style of moral behaviour people should follow), applied ethics (the academic study of applying ethical theory to real-life situations, including bioethics, political ethics, etc.), and descriptive ethics (gathering information about how people actually live, and making generalisations from observed styles).
It does not start from a preconceived theory of ethics, but rather investigates actual moral choices made and observed by actual moral agents, all the ethical factors that led to that choice, and the ethical views held by the social group in question.
The history of ethics includes Greek-Roman ethics and medieval Christian ethics.
The first part is humanistic ethical thought, represented by Valla and Montaigne, etc.
The second part is the ethical thought of the Reformation represented by Calvin.
The third part: Political ethics, represented by Machiavelli and others, modern ethics (17-18th century, British empirical ethics, represented by Hume and others, 17-18th century, European rationalist ethics, represented by Spinoza and others, 18th century, French enlightenment ethics, represented by Voltaire and others, 18-19th century, German academy ethics, represented by Kant and Hegel and others, 18-19th century, British utilitarian ethics, represented by Bentham and Sidgwick and others, 19th century, British evolutionary ethics, represented by Spencer and Huxley and others, late 19th century, German neo-Kantian ethics, represented by Rickert and others, late 19th century, neo-Hegelian ethics, represented by Thomas Hill Green and others), transitional ethics (non-rationalist ethics, represented by Kierkegaard, Schopenhauer and Nietzsche and others).
Logic is the study of "the principles and standards of valid inference and proof".
Logic usually consists of three parts: inductive reasoning, abductive reasoning, and deductive reasoning, which can be divided into formal logic and informal logic.
Aesthetics is a discipline that focuses on the study of the nature and meaning of beauty.

Yang Xingche, whose real name is Jiang Bo, was born in the year of the sheep and the month of the sheep. He walked on the grass and found his place in life, so he was called Yang Xingche, or "Uncle Yang".
In the industry, he is known as a "mystery genius" because he has published a series of works, such as "Strange Tales from Thailand", "Strange Tales from India", "Strange Tales from Japan" and "Strange Tales from South Korea". He claims that he is "good at talking nonsense in a serious manner".
“Under the lamplight”, also known as “Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio”, the “mystery genius” Yang Xingyou brings you a new work “Under the lamplight”, which takes you deep into the essence of Chinese folk customs.

Ding Zilin: To a friend.
I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to all my friends for their humanitarian assistance during the long 30-year period since the death of our relatives, especially since I issued an appeal for humanitarian assistance to my friends at home and abroad in my own name in early 1994, and the assistance has never been interrupted until now.
At present, most of the parents of the deceased have passed away, and their children have grown up, married and employed.
It is your good deeds that have helped us through the most difficult moments.
At present, the COVID-19 is ravaging the world, and most of the donors have reached retirement age.
Therefore, I earnestly request you to stop the humanitarian donations to the Tiananmen Mothers group - this humanitarian relief activity should have ended a long time ago.
I will always remember your love, and I believe that your efforts will be recorded in history.
Due to various reasons, I can only express my wishes in this way. Please forgive me, my friends!
Please accept my sincere wishes.
Tao Ye said: Please allow me to take this opportunity to make a simple introduction to the 32-year history of the International Federation of Chinese Students and Scholars (IFCSS) and the Minnesota Chinese Democracy Foundation (MCDF) engaged in humanitarian assistance.
In the course of humanitarian assistance, the American Association of Universities and the Minnesota China Democracy Foundation are two parallel organizations, and the implementers of projects often overlap.
(Apple Daily picture: Tiananmen Mothers website is managed by Tao Ye.) pic.twitter.com/UxID9ZGjzm
The relief funds often fail to reach the hands of June 4th victims.
In 1994, at the suggestion of Mr. Ding, the “Tiananmen Mothers” set up a special group to coordinate and be in charge of the receipt and distribution of relief funds.
In 1998, the MCDF established the "June 4th Orphans Education Fund", and 11 years later, in 2009, after all the June 4th orphans had graduated from university, the MCDF established the "June 4th Orphaned Elderly Special Relief Fund", which has been implemented ever since.
The funding for these projects mainly came from campus and social donations in 1989, generous individual donations, and the support of the Democracy Foundation of Brother Universities.
Since 2018, it has also been supported by the Foundation for Criminal Justice Research.
It was not until last year, 31 years later, that the June 4th victims finally received a portion of the donations raised in Hong Kong in the name of the June 4th incident.
During this time, Human Rights in China also independently carried out its humanitarian assistance projects.
We understand that Mr. Ding called off the June 4th donation in consideration of the donors. We are also some retired old people, and our incomes are not as plentiful as before retirement. We would like to express our gratitude to Mr. Ding for his “Letter to Friends”.
We will respect the decision of the asylum seekers, and terminate the project within two years and resume it immediately if needed.
At the same time, we would like to express our gratitude and respect to those brave compatriots who have been generous and risked their lives to deliver humanitarian aid for many years.

After opening the box, please check if the goods are complete.
If there is any shortage, please contact customer service in time.
The cover plate of the microfluidic chip is made of PC material, please do not introduce solvents that will chemically react with PC.
Do not use a hand-held injector to inject directly into the chip, otherwise it is easy to cause leakage.

Members' Comments
[Effect] Photo effect: I took two sets of clothes. Overall, it was not bad. I liked this set of pictures.
Service details: Because I was pregnant, I felt a bit uncomfortable during the makeup. The makeup artist and staff were very considerate. They let me rest for a while and kept pouring me hot water to drink.
Package price: RMB 1,000
Thank you for the rabbit's review. I originally said that the ancient style was not suitable for the ancient style. I didn't expect the finished product to be so beautiful.
Thank you, Dandan, for your recognition. Your satisfaction can power us to keep moving forward. We will continue to work hard!
This photography studio is really great. I highly recommend it to all of you!
No matter from reception, makeup, clothing, lighting, photography to post-production, it is impeccable.
The makeup artists are especially delicate, and will match the makeup according to your style, and the cosmetics used are all top brands.
Teacher Tian Liang doesn't need to say more. Photography is quite professional.
The whole studio has an artistic atmosphere, and there are two little kittens to play with.
We are working in Beijing, and the better photo studios in Beijing need to be booked half a year in advance. Some of my colleagues took photos in Beijing, and after seeing the finished product, I thought it was just so-so.
I went out of my way to find this studio, a place with soul and attitude.
Our facial expression management is not very good, and we feel that this is also the shortcoming of most people. The photographer Brother Liang will take pictures and record the natural and wonderful moments.
A makeup artist, a photographer, a post-production designer, a good team.
When it came out, we and the people around us all praised it.
I've already recommended it to a friend, and she was just as happy after seeing the negatives.
It is hoped that such a studio will not be buried, and that more people will discover it and shoot in their own style, instead of following the crowd.
Many thanks to the five-star reviews from Zhan Ying and Jing Ling. Both of them are very creative newcomers, and we are a creative studio. As long as the customer likes it, we will do our best to complete it. Thank you for knowing and meeting
The sweet and considerate assistant, as well as the lively and cheerful photography teacher, everyone in the team is so nice. It was a wonderful shooting and an unforgettable experience, and the shooting results were much better than I expected. Thank you all for your hard work. I am very grateful to you all.
Thank you for your comments, Xiaoyu. It is also a kind of fate for us to get to know you. From Hohhot to Qinhuangdao, your trust in us is a journey of thousands of kilometers. I am very happy to get to know you. If there is a chance, I will come to Qinhuangdao to play next time.

A programming novice who wants to share his personal experience.
If you intend to enter this industry, you can choose to go to a place for training, but if you don't have this idea, it's better to learn by yourself. After all, the cost of training is very high, and it takes 6 months to learn.
But if you are planning to enter this industry, training is indeed a very good choice, especially for those who are extremely weak in self-control. Training is a very good choice.
If you have strong self-control, you can choose self-study, but it will be more tiring.
Of course, choosing a good training institution is very important.
First of all, we should look at the strength of the teachers of this institution. If the strength of the teachers is not strong enough, this training institution will not be meaningful. Of course, the strength of the teachers of some newly opened training institutions is not particularly strong.
Second, it is best to inquire about the training institution before making a choice, and it is also best to inquire about the students who have graduated from this institution. After all, only the students of the institution know what the institution is like and whether the courses taught are good or not.
Hello, in fact, I don't know how to answer this question of yours, because I didn't make a certain introduction about your own situation, and learning this thing has a lot to do with your own situation.
For example, your profession, age, the language you want to learn, and even the city you live in are all related to the industry you learn or want to engage in.
If you are a student and have not graduated yet, or if you are a computer science student who has graduated, I personally recommend self-study if you have enough time. This is the most efficient and cost-effective. Now many offline and online training institutions are actually very good, but the learning cost is high, and it takes a lot of time, and basically requires concentrated training for 3-6 months.
However, if I talk about these situations, it is very convenient to learn by yourself. There are many free learning resources on the Internet now, or you can go to B station for many training resources. If you don't know how to find resources, you can also contact me through the introduction to get free resources or detailed consultation.
In addition, there are some classic books that can be combined with videos for comprehensive learning.
If you are not a computer major but can also pay some learning money and time cost, it is recommended to go to a training institution to learn, so that you don't have to learn hard, the teacher explains in detail, and there are people to answer questions. In addition, it can also help in learning planning or supervision.
In addition, many training institutions will sign employment agreements. They will have internal referral quotas. After learning, they will recommend going to the company. In this way, the subsequent job search interview process can save a lot of things.
Here are some of my views. Because I don’t know your situation, I can only give a brief and not detailed introduction. If you have other questions, you can contact me at any time for communication.
I said I would be there before 1 o'clock and I saw it on the app
What is
I haven't finished speaking, what are you doing?
I will accept all kinds of (installation, cleaning, maintenance), wall-mounted water heaters, water purifiers, washing machines, air conditioners, toilets, stoves, range hoods, lighting fixtures, glass cleaning, professional beautification, and housekeeping services.
Thank you to those who silently gave me likes. I will continue to work hard for life. Life is tiring, but I have to continue.
Life will not disappoint those who work hard. If you like it, please pay attention to me. Thanks to those who silently gave me likes.
Life is like this, others only look at the results, and you have to endure the process alone. In the face of life, we have no choice but to be strong and continue. We can look back on the road, but we can't go back...
Cleaning is a job, and it is also a responsibility. Life is beautiful because of service, and service is wonderful because of dedication.

My daily work
— Your request, my service.
Serve with heart, clean with heart, and keep the beauty.
The details that you care about, Fenggui Home Care has done it to the best of my ability, serving the family with love.
Keep the Wan family clean, set up a monument to family governance, serve in place, and clean up to the home.
Indoor and outdoor cleaning, my daily work
Although the crystal lamp is gorgeous, it will become dim without cleaning for a long time. Only after cleaning can it radiate its brilliance. Life is the same
Only by working hard can we succeed. Only by being meticulous can we create exquisite things. We are serious about making beautiful seams.
Give me a chance, and I will definitely make you satisfied. Quality speaks for itself, because professionalism is worthy of trust. Your recognition is my greatest encouragement!
It's hard to make a living in any industry right now!
However, I always believe that as long as I have a serious attitude, persist, and work hard, I will be a little better than others, at least better than sitting around complaining!"
One day is planned in the morning, and all good things start in the morning. I wish you to start a new day with happiness, luck, health, and wishes come true, and keep a good mood all day long. Good morning.
When we were young, happiness was a thing, and when we had it, we were happy. When we grew up, happiness was a goal, and when we achieved it, we were happy. When we became mature, we found that happiness was actually a state of mind, and when we understood it, we were happy.
Be the most authentic and kindest version of yourself, follow your heart, and have no regrets in this life. Life is a path, walk your own path. Life has two treasures: good health and a good mood. Live to a ripe old age!
At every stage of life, different problems will be encountered.
Most of the time, what is holding you back is not your ability, but the courage to face it positively.
Since it cannot be avoided, it is better to face it frankly.
The more you fear, the more easily you will be defeated by the difficulties; if you meet the difficulties head-on, the problems will eventually be solved.
Chinese curators join hands to hold Saudi Arabia's first contemporary art biennial - Xinhua News
Xinhua News Agency, Riyadh, December 12 (Reporters Wang Haizhou and Hu Guan) The first contemporary art biennial of Saudi Arabia, the Diriyah Contemporary Art Biennial, was officially opened to the public on the 11th at the Diriyah JAX Art District in the northwest of the Saudi capital Riyadh, with 64 artists from Saudi Arabia, China and other places participating.
This biennial was jointly planned by the Saudi Diriyah Biennial Foundation and the UCCA Ullens Center for Contemporary Art in China. The director of the UCCA Ullens Center for Contemporary Art in China, Tian Feiyue, served as the artistic director.
According to the curatorial team, the theme of this biennial is “crossing the river by feeling the stones”, which is a metaphor for the reform strategies taken during the period of social and economic transformation, and also reflects the current situation of the development of Saudi society and culture.
This biennial exhibition covers an area of nearly 12,000 square meters, and the exhibition hall spans six interconnected buildings and is presented in six units: Touching the Stone to Cross the River, Inheritance as Experiment, Peripheral Thinking, Towards the Public, Beautiful New World, and On the Spirit of Art.
Among them, more than 40% of the works are by 27 Saudi artists, covering various forms such as painting, installation art and performance art; the works of the 12 Chinese artists are also well received. Some artists use recycled materials in a novel way to create works, such as Xu Bing's "Behind the Story Series: Endless Picture of Streams and Mountains" (2014), in which he used discarded materials to reconstruct a classic landscape painting.
Barkley, the CEO of the Diriyah Biennale Foundation, said that he hoped that this biennial would establish international dialogue and allow global audiences to have the opportunity to understand Saudi Arabia's booming cultural industry and creative community, and strengthen interaction.
Thaddaeus Ropac said, "The goal of the biennial is two-fold: to allow Saudi contemporary art to participate in global dialogue, and to allow Saudi audiences to immerse themselves in the contemporary art world. "
It is understood that during the opening week of the biennale, a series of lectures will also be held. Artists, curators and opinion leaders from the creative industry will discuss topics such as cross-cultural exchange and the development of contemporary art.

The Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, December 12 (Reporter Lin Bifeng) In order to continue to do a good job of employment assistance for people who have been lifted out of poverty, consolidate and expand the achievements of poverty alleviation, Yunnan Province has recently issued relevant policies on the management of rural public welfare posts to promote rural revitalization, which will help to comprehensively promote rural revitalization.
The relevant person in charge of the Yunnan Provincial Human Resources and Social Security Department introduced that currently, Yunnan has developed a total of 448,300 rural public welfare posts, which are used to settle employment for rural difficult groups such as poverty-stricken labor force, and play an important role in helping the poverty-stricken people to realize employment and income increase, consolidate the achievements of poverty alleviation, and effectively enhance the ability of various public services in the countryside.
This new regulation was jointly issued by seven departments including Yunnan Human Resources and Social Security, Rural Revitalization and Finance, mainly to unify the scope of objects, fund management, post development, post management, and other aspects of the recruitment of rural public welfare posts at the grassroots level.
In terms of post development and setting, the new regulations clearly stipulate that posts should be set up according to the principles of "setting posts according to demand, setting people according to posts, dynamic management, and total control", "who develops, who uses, and who is responsible", and "one person, one post, voluntary and open, and unified management".
The recruitment process must be carried out in accordance with the steps of announcement, application, examination, announcement, employment, pre-job training and arrangement for on-the-job.
In addition, the new regulation also clarified the specific responsibilities of the main development departments of rural public welfare posts, the subsidy standards and subsidy methods of rural public welfare posts, and stipulated that each rural public welfare post development department should purchase commercial accident insurance for rural public welfare post placement personnel; and required the relevant departments to regularly supervise the subsidy payment of rural public welfare posts.

Hi
Can I cancel my order?
I ordered it again
Whether it has been canceled
Second, although the right-wing has had a successful time in history, it is not long. Therefore, it is short because it is brilliant with a little sunshine and sweats with a sip of water; it can look far beyond the horizon when it is a little successful, but it will follow suit when it is hit.
In fact, the right-wing has played a positive role in the process of social progress.
In terms of ending the Cultural Revolution, defining the standard of truth, developing the economy, improving science and technology, and promoting the institutionalization of politics and human rights protection, the positive significance of the right wing should not be denied.
Thirdly, in my opinion, although I do not entirely agree with some of Li Weidong's statements, I pay attention to his statements and respect Li Weidong as a person; because he is serious, he is serious about China, and he also takes China's social problems seriously.
But I oppose his anti-communist theory. I believe that a counter-revolution is necessary. A revolution will inevitably lead to social turmoil, damage to the people's livelihood, a mixed-up political group, and foreign countries taking advantage of the situation.
Fourth, to change or improve China, we must have patience and a sense of responsibility to the country and the people. Those who try to take chestnuts out of the fire for political purposes are not right-wingers, but scoundrels.
Let's talk about the left.
The left, in fact, is a group of outcasts of the times and politics.
If the right has a positive meaning for the society, the Communist Party will listen to some of the right's opinions and analyze their thoughts when needed. However, the left has no such good fortune, because what the left wants is exactly what the Communist Party has thrown away!
Fifth, recently, I have seen some friends arguing with anti-imperialists and refuting the left-wing lunatics, which is quite impressive. I think it is unnecessary.
Don't try to reason with a traitor or a left-winger, they are both one-track minds, and it is impossible to reason with them.
Also, don't try to prove that we are right, and don't think of making anti-revolutionaries and left-wingers admit it. Why bother?
I tell my friends that when the counter-revolutionaries call you a five-cent, and when the left-wingers call you a right-wing dog, it just proves that our middle path is correct!
Many people have ideals in their youth, but when they get older, they forget their ideals, or pursue their ideals but become obsessed.
and ideals are getting farther and farther away, and even the dragon-slaying youth has become an evil dragon.
I think left and right generally refers to constraints and freedom, and China, as a whole, is left-leaning from the innate genes of its history and culture.
Domestic right-wing freedom emphasizes efficiency and development, while left-wingers strengthen supervision and place more emphasis on fairness and safety.
Now, the society as a whole hopes to pay more attention to fairness, while China and the United States are competing with each other, and leaning to the left is positive. It is estimated that it will last for many years.
Although I can't understand it, it's OK to just give it a like.
Nothing to say, Hua Hua is so righteous
In the past two years, the blockade and encirclement of Huawei chips by the United States has not only put Huawei into an unprecedented predicament, but also caused huge losses to the "American" enterprises.
The United States has suppressed China's chip industry, requiring its own enterprises and relevant enterprises of allied countries to block China's chip industry at the same time, and the direct consequences are that the orders and profits of global chip suppliers are affected, causing a reduction in R&D investment and production capacity of chip production enterprises, thus causing a shortage and disorder of the global chip supply chain.
Nowadays, the "chip shortage" has affected all major industries around the world. For example, car manufacturers have stopped production and mobile phone prices have risen. Almost all industries that use chips have been affected.
In order to control the "chip" autonomy, more and more national science and technology giants have begun to take the path of "de-Americanization".
In order to firmly control the global semiconductor control rights and curb the development of China’s semiconductor industry, the United States has recently taken frequent actions. First, it hosted the “Chip Summit”. Then, it invited the giants of 64 countries to establish a semiconductor alliance and allocated funds to support the domestic technology giants of the United States. For example, the old-fashioned technology giant Intel of the United States spent 20 billion US dollars to build two wafer processing plants in Arizona, the United States, and to open up chip outsourcing business to the outside world in order to regain its dominant position in the chip field.
When most people believe that Intel's move will have a certain impact on TSMC, and it is very likely to take away TSMC's "job".
The reason for the certainty is that Intel, as an old-fashioned high-tech giant in the United States, has been deeply involved in the semiconductor field for decades, and has a large number of human resources and technical reserves, which must rise rapidly in a short period of time and defeat TSMC.
However, TSMC founder Zhang Zhongmou did not care about Intel's decision.
In the "2021 Master Think Tank Forum" held in April this year, Zhang Zhongmou made a stunning statement. Regarding Intel's investment in building a wafer factory, Zhang Zhongmou said frankly: It is quite ironic for Intel to build a chip foundry.
The reason why Zhang Zhongmou is disdainful of Intel's foray into the wafer field is that Zhang Zhongmou still remembers the grievances between TSMC and Intel more than 30 years ago.
In the 1960s and 1970s, Intel was always the pearl of the US manufacturing industry, standing at the top of the world, and the overlord of the global semiconductor industry.
Until the 1980s, the world's high-end semiconductor chips were always in the hands of a few strong players.
At that time, the semiconductor industry was characterized by the IDM model, and the chip was completed from design to packaging and testing by a single factory. Intel was the representative of that era.
However, such a model makes some small and medium-sized enterprises overwhelmed, and many semiconductor entrepreneurs face huge production line construction costs and can only give up.
Under the call of market demand, after entering the 1980s, the chip industry began to appear the phenomenon of division of labor and cooperation. In 1984, Zhang Zhongmou heard that there was a company specializing in chip design. He thought that since there was a company specializing in design, a company specializing in wafer manufacturing could be established.
Not long after, Zhang Zhongmou's idea became a reality, and TSMC was born.
TSMC has focused its main business on the single stage of "wafer processing", and does not engage in design, but only provides foundry services for wafer manufacturing.
At that time, TSMC, which was just established, was just a little guy in front of the giant Intel.
In order to obtain capital support, Zhang Zhonghua once sought investment from Intel, but when Intel heard that TSMC was only engaged in the manufacturing link of the chip industry, it obviously had a high self-esteem, looked down on TSMC, and decisively refused to invest in TSMC.
Zhang Zhongmou also determined that Intel at that time looked down on the wafer process service.
Unexpectedly, the giants that looked down on wafer manufacturing services in the past now have to start doing wafer manufacturing.
Therefore, Zhang Zhongmou felt that it was ironic for Intel to enter the foundry business.
Today, TSMC's market value has exceeded that of Intel.
In the face of TSMC’s powerful offensive, Intel is naturally not allowed to stand still.
Today, TSMC is rushing towards 3nm chips, while Intel is still stuck at 14nm, which was 7 years ago.
It is not easy to catch up.
I can't wait
It's been 2 hours since I placed the order at 19:06 😅
Today, let's take a look at some "strange hot searches".
What is normal public opinion?
Three hot searches are randomly selected: February 2 Dragon’s Head, Goodfriend Price Increase, and Huolala Incident. The public opinion expands to form a peak, and then [the index decreases] (smooth curve) and eventually dissipates. If secondary public opinion is generated, there will be a small peak again.
They look similar to the "Network Public Opinion Evolution Model" displayed on the website of the Cyberspace Administration of China.
What is abnormal public opinion?
Randomly select six hot searches in the same event, and it shows the shape of "single peak", "sawtooth" and "cliff".
The "isolated peak" means that it is artificially heated, quickly rushed into the hot search, and attracted the attention of the public; the "sawtooth" means that it is periodically heated to ensure that the topic stays on the hot search list; the "cliff" means that it is a collective evacuation. This hot search has played its "function" and received a new task and rushed to a new battlefield.
In Figure 9, the heat wave peak of one event is exactly the trough of another event, and the time is exactly the same, which must be the unified batch of water army receiving the task and launching a new round of attack.
The professionalization of black public relations is evident: dozens of hot searches are listed at the same time, which attract attention, which are responsible for popular science, which are responsible for incitement, which are responsible for diverting attention, which are responsible for influencing cognition, which are responsible for misleading judgment, which are responsible for inciting emotions, and which are responsible for making decisions. The black production accounts are divided into batches and nodes for fine-grained warfare, almost taking into account all elements in the spread of public opinion.
Public relations is a science. No matter what one’s stance or emotions are, or any other subjective factors, black public relations will not be able to escape from objective data.
Everyone who passes by will leave traces, and we will dig out these traces together.

Mauritius and other countries have found the first case of Omicron variant infection - Xinhua News Agency
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 12 - According to reports from overseas correspondents of Xinhua News Agency, Mauritius, Cyprus and Malawi recently reported the first cases of infection with the Omicron variant of the new coronavirus.
Mauritius reported its first two cases of the omicron variant on the 10th.
According to Mauritius Minister of Health Kailesh Jagutpal, one of the infected persons is a tourist who arrived in Mauritius on November 27 from South Africa; the other infected person is a Mauritian local resident who tested positive on November 30 after coming into contact with a person who had recently returned from South Africa.
After being isolated and treated in the hospital, the nucleic acid test results of the two infected persons turned negative, and they have now returned to their respective places of residence.
On the 10th, the Cyprus Ministry of Health announced that the country had confirmed three cases of infection with the Omicron strain for the first time.
These three people were all students who came back from traveling abroad at the beginning of this month. Because they were all mild cases, they did not go to the hospital for treatment.
In order to prevent the spread of the Omicron variant, the government of Seychelles is continuously increasing its prevention and control efforts.
From December 6 to January 10, 2023, passengers aged 12 and above entering the country by plane must pay for a nucleic acid test at the airport upon arrival.
The Ministry of Health of Seychelles announced on the 10th that it will start vaccinating children aged 5 to 11 with the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine.
Malawian Health Minister Khumbize Chiponda said on the 9th that the country has found three cases of Omicron infection for the first time.
The country's health department conducted genome sequencing on 12 positive samples collected from November 9 to December 2, and found these three infection cases.

They received a stomach full of money

Okay, the phone number is #PHONENUMBER#
Do I need to stay in the conversation?
I called #NAME# and explained to your staff
Your rider told me the address was too far
Da Mei 360 integrated home decoration
Address: No. 156, Huancheng South Road, Room 12, Happiness Garden
At the beginning, it was introduced by friends. Because of trust, I chose to have a look. My initial budget was 70,000 for a basic renovation.
They started a series of tricks when they came to the store.
I went to the store for the first time. I just showed them my floor plan. They didn't go to measure the house. They actually gave me a quote saying that my 135-square-meter house could be done for 70,000, and they roughly showed me their materials, but I didn't know what brand of materials they were.
Their second scam is that once you get to the store, they will drag you into paying a deposit (which you can never get back, unless you have enough experience to argue with them).
When I was hesitating whether to pay the deposit, they would invite their so-called manager to tell me that if I paid the deposit today, they could give me a lot of discounts.
This is a big pit. I am a living example of being cheated. I paid a deposit of more than 10,000 yuan in a moment of impulse.
His quote to me had a lot of issues - £70,000 did not include water and electrics, and did not include any doors, cupboards or bathrooms, and these three things are the biggest expenses of the base work.
Aside from these, their service point fees are also higher than those of other companies.
I lost trust in this company because they asked me to sign a contract without telling me anything at first.
When I went to get my money back, they were very experienced, with a special team to deal with you.
They will always say it's the customer's problem and they have nothing to do with it.
Various excuses, and many details, I don't want to talk about one by one. In short, don't choose them, because my friend's house that was renovated by them is also of poor quality, and they will charge you various fees later.
It’s terrible. They’re the same as the original fake dragon head decoration. Now they’ve changed to Da Mei. It seems like they’ve gone out of business again and changed to something else.
So don't choose such a shitty decoration company.
In the future, when everyone chooses, they should do more Baidu and check these consultations. Because renovation is not a small amount of money.
To ask a question of a business, please log in or register
It is strictly forbidden to publish various forms of merchant comments. For details, please refer to the Merchant Inclusion Statement.
The decoration design channel of Dianping in Kunming provides you with the latest merchant information such as the address, phone number, and business hours of Da Mei 360 Integrated Home Furnishings. If you want to find a decoration company, just go to Dianping.
If it is not delivered within 30 minutes, please cancel the order!
Is there no other way? For example, change the address?
OK, then don't cancel this conversation. If you don't refund my money within 5 to 10 days, I will definitely pursue it.
I asked if it was possible to cancel in less than 15 minutes
The saliva chicken should be cooked, but what we received was raw meat, and we couldn't eat it.
Starry Sky Appointment丨The Gemini Meteor Shower will reach its peak on the 14th - Xinhua Net
New China News Agency, Tianjin, December 12 (Reporter Zhou Runjian) The astronomy popularization expert introduced that as the last large-scale meteor shower of this year, the Gemini meteor shower, one of the three major meteor showers in the Northern Hemisphere, will reach its peak on December 14th. Friends who like meteor showers can observe it in the late night of that day.
The Geminid meteor shower photographed by Beijing astronomy enthusiast Anjiu on December 13, 2018 in Qinghai.
Most meteor showers are produced by periodic comets, but the Geminids are produced by 3200 Phaethon, an Apollo-type asteroid.
The Geminids are also the second known meteor shower not to be "parented" by a comet.
Xiu Lipeng, a director of the Tianjin Astronomical Society and an astronomy popularization expert, said that just like a New Year's movie, the Gemini meteor shower generally appears at the end of the year, and the "screening period" can last from December 4th to 17th.
This meteor shower is famous for its large and stable flow, and is known as one of the three major meteor showers in the northern hemisphere along with the Quadrantid meteor shower and the Perseid meteor shower.
A prominent feature of the Gemini meteor shower is that the speed of the meteor is slow, the color is rich, and there are also many fireballs, which is suitable for both visual observation and astrophotography for beginners.
On December 13, 2020, the Gemini meteor shower was photographed by Tianjin astronomy enthusiast Yang Jing in Jizhou, Tianjin.
The astronomical forecast shows that the Geminid meteor shower this year will reach its peak around 15:00 on December 14th, with a ZHR (the number of meteors seen per hour under ideal observing conditions when the radiant is directly overhead) of 150.
The Geminid meteor shower recommended index chart.
"Last year, the Gemini meteor shower left a deep impression on people, but this year's Gemini meteor shower will be affected by the moonlight and the level of excitement will be discounted.
The 14th is the 11th day of the 11th month of the lunar calendar, and the moon phase is a waxing gibbous. The bright moonlight will interfere with observation, but fortunately the moon will set in the late night, and the radiant point of the Gemini meteor shower will also rise higher.
Friends who like meteor showers can observe them in the few hours after midnight when the moon sets, but pay attention to keeping warm. "
How can you see as many meteors as possible?
"It is not recommended to observe in the city. You can choose a place with high altitude, little light pollution, and a wide field of view facing the northeast in the suburbs or countryside, and then wait patiently until the moon sets and observe with the naked eye.
It should be noted that the Gemini meteor shower has a large flow in all directions, so you don't have to stare at the Gemini meteor shower's radiation point when observing.
If you like photography, you should choose a wide-angle lens with a large aperture, and use high ISO and maximum aperture when taking pictures.
A tripod, spare batteries and a cable release are also essential for stability and continuity. "
Xie Lipeng reminded.
What are the differences in market positioning between laser TVs and traditional TVs?
According to my understanding, the traditional television mentioned by the questioner should refer to the liquid crystal television, and the difference in market positioning between laser television and liquid crystal television mainly has the following two points:
First, the laser TV is more focused on the big screen market.
Compared with the comprehensive market positioning of LCD TVs, laser TVs are obviously more focused on the large-screen market, or in other words, laser TVs are products born for large screens.
Currently, the size of mainstream LCD TVs is mostly between 55 inches and 65 inches, and the size of laser TVs is generally more than 75 inches, with the largest exceeding 100 inches, fully meeting the needs of users for large-screen color TVs.
In recent years, the global shipments and sales of laser TVs have been constantly increasing, and they account for more than 60% of the total TV sales of 80 inches and above.
According to the forecast of Zhongyikang, the sales growth of laser TV market will exceed 140% in 2020, and continue to maintain a high growth rate.
The reason why it has achieved such good results in the large screen market is mainly due to the excellent performance of laser TV in eye protection.
Based on the imaging principle of laser TV diffuse reflection, the light emitted by the laser light source does not directly enter the eyeball. Compared with the backlight source of liquid crystal TV, the imaging process is closer to the imaging process of objects under natural conditions, and the stimulation to the eyes is also smaller.
The Xi Si laboratory of the China Electronics Technology Standardization Research Institute and ophthalmologists from Beijing Union Medical College Hospital conducted a strict comparison test of watching laser TVs and LCD TVs under the same conditions of the crowd, and obtained 144 sets of test data.
Data confirms that laser TVs do have strong eye protection features, and even have a certain improvement effect in certain aspects.
In the current era when eye health is increasingly valued, laser TV has not only attracted more users with its eye protection advantages, but also opened up another breakthrough in the color TV market.
Second, the laser TV is more focused on the high-end market.
While the price of LCD TVs is constantly falling, the price of current laser TVs on the market is mostly above RMB 10,000. With the upgrading of size and light source, the price is gradually rising.
Why are laser TVs so expensive?
There must be a reason.
Under the continuous development of light source and technology level, laser TV has many advantages that cannot be achieved by LCD TV and projector.
With the ultra-short focal length projection technology, the projection distance of the laser TV is relatively shorter than that of the traditional projector. It can achieve a 100-inch large screen experience in a short distance. The required space is not large, and the host is small and occupies very little space.
In terms of brightness, large-brand laser TVs can reach more than 2000 lumens.
In addition, it generates less heat and causes less damage to the equipment, and the television has a longer service life.
In addition to this, many high-end laser TVs are equipped with true 4K super-high-definition picture quality, artificial intelligence systems, biomimetic screens, and other cutting-edge technologies, which can bring users a more shocking audio-visual experience.
It's not fake demand, but the product of demand segmentation. In terms of picture quality and input-output ratio, laser TV is not suitable for audio-visual players. If you want to take into account the large screen and insufficient viewing environment, you can try it. Everything has its pros and cons. You can make your own judgment after weighing it. I'm afraid that you will listen to one-sided words.
In short, the ultra-wide-angle near-focus projector - the laser TV - has to use expensive ultra-wide-angle lenses and mirrors in order to be close to the screen, which is not in line with the best optical design.
In order to shield part of the environmental light, the use of micro-structured Fresnel screen is expensive, and the price of an 80-inch screen is basically enough to buy a 65-inch LCD.
There is one more thing, I really hate the projector manufacturers using diffuse reflection as a selling point, please, the light on the screen that the eyes can see is direct light for the eyes, when you diffuse it onto the ceiling, the eyes can't see it either, and the LCD TV is also "direct diffuse", isn't the ceiling also illuminated when the TV is turned on?
In addition, if the projection screen is not a diffuse reflection, it will not form an image at all.
It is exactly the hot spot (light spot) effect of the high-gain screen that has been overlooked. When a large amount of light is reflected into the eyes at a certain angle, it is really uncomfortable.
The Visual Aesthetics Photography Gallery is a quality store that has not yet opened a branch.
I added her on WeChat to make an appointment, and the little sister arranged the time I could choose and sent it to me. The reply was prompt.
Before leaving, I looked at the shooting works in the store. There were more outdoor wedding photos, which were very beautiful, and there were many shooting styles involved.
After I arrived that day, I had a brief exchange of ideas with the little sister, and she patiently helped me try on two styles of clothes that I was struggling with. In the end, I settled on the makeup and styling. Before the photographer took the photos, he would place some props and give guidance on movements. He was also very meticulous about every detail.
But maybe because we didn’t communicate our specific shooting ideas, so the photos didn’t turn out to be the style I wanted, but they should be good-looking 🙊🙊
After the shoot, the photographer will help select the photos and discuss the post-production style, which is pretty attentive.
It takes about half a month to repair the film, and wait for the effect~
I won the second time in the photo class king’s meal activity. Most of the clothes in the store can be chosen for a photo shoot.
In the end, I chose a black chiffon skirt to experience a different style.
The entire shooting process takes about 2 hours, including makeup and shooting. The photographer in charge of the shooting is the younger brother of 1995. I feel that he is still a bit green. I hope that in the future, he can give more suggestions on customer shooting action guidance. He is quite talkative, and the shooting process is quite pleasant.
The Visual Aesthetics Photography Gallery, a selected quality store, replies
Queenie is on the home page now, come and take a look~
First fill in your name and phone number at the store, and then choose clothes. Wedding dresses can also be selected. After changing three or four sets of clothes, they are quite patient. After the selection, the makeup took a long time. The service attitude is also good. Later, when shooting, they will teach you how to pose. The feeling of the photos is that the face is too big. The retouching is said to take half a month, and it was sent in three or four days. The feeling is not much different from the original.
[Environment] The overall environment is good.
There are a lot of options in clothing.
There are about three makeup positions, and there is a photography studio inside.
The service is very enthusiastic and attentive.
The stylists are very patient.
The photographer will also take time to teach you how to pose.
If the photographer is not satisfied, he will also take the initiative to shoot again.
[Experience] The style may be a bit too much. The original double eyelids were turned into three eyelids.
The tail of the eyebrow was also shaved off, which was a bit awkward for people who don't draw their eyebrows every day.
The photos were given to me about ten days ago, but the P-photo effect is not very satisfactory. It feels that the pasted double eyelids are still very obvious.
Because I wasn't quite sure what style I wanted, I tried on two sets of clothes. In the end, I chose the black dress. The little sister said that this set was a more Hepburn retro style.
After choosing the clothes, I started to do my hair and makeup. The hair stylist and makeup artist were both very patient in helping me. I was very satisfied with the result.
After getting my makeup and hair done, we started taking photos. The photographer gave me instructions on how to pose the whole time, and the process was very relaxed and harmonious.
After the shoot, I carefully selected four of my favorite photos to be retouched. The little brother said that the photos would be ready within 15 days, and I was very satisfied with the outcome.
3 days and no reply...I can't join the #PRS_ORG# Plus monthly plan because your system can't recognise my credit card!
The strangest thing was that I used the same credit card every time I paid.
I now have to pay shipping every time
Can I first be exempted, and then you can collect my monthly fee after you have finished your investigation?
Is it worth buying insurance for a small umbrella?
Xiaoyu Umbrella is an online insurance brokerage platform.
In terms of setting conditions: According to the reminder of the "Regulations on the Supervision of Insurance Brokerage Institutions (revised in 2015)", in order to become an insurance brokerage company, three key words must be met: shareholders, the initiator must have no major illegal records in the past three years, the minimum amount is 50 million yuan, and it must be approved by the China Insurance Regulatory Commission.
These three requirements are actually very strict. In summary, it is necessary to have strength, to be approved by the national authoritative department of the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (which regulates insurance companies and banks nationwide), and to have shareholders with good conduct. As an umbrella insurance of insurance brokerage companies, policyholders do not need to question whether Xiaoyu umbrella insurance is regular or not. After all, there are these three thresholds, which cannot be achieved by any insurance company.
On this point, it's not bad, and it's trustworthy.
In terms of insurance products: Xiaoyu Umbrella Insurance is an insurance supermarket, and many companies’ star critical illness insurance are sold on this platform, such as the newly listed Haitai Super Mary 5 Critical Illness Insurance. The claimant and the insurer are both Haitai Life Insurance, and Xiaoyu Umbrella Insurance is just a third-party intermediary, so there is no need to question its credibility.
In terms of payment method: Internet platform products, because of the lack of operating costs of the business outlets and the cost of business employees, the Internet products are generally cost-effective, and the payment method is flexible, supporting monthly payment, reducing the payment pressure of the insured, and at the same time can maximize the leverage of insurance.
That's pretty good.
It can be considered.
From the perspective of the professionalism of the sales staff: this is especially important, because insurance is a highly professional industry, and many Internet product customers can insure themselves. This will lead to many misunderstandings. In terms of health declaration and occupation, non-insurance practitioners often add their own subjective consciousness when applying for insurance, thinking that they are healthy or in compliance, which will easily lead to many potential claims risks and the risk of being denied a claim.
I myself have done insurance phone sales on "Tencent Micro Protection" (just like an umbrella, it is also an internet insurance brokerage platform), and I told everyone in a very responsible manner.
Internet insurance is real and reliable, but people are not reliable. There are no professional practitioners in the Internet channels, and there are many sales misguidance.
For example, 1 yuan insurance covers 6 million, buying insurance to send a mobile phone, free to receive 60,000 critical illness benefits, these marketing strategies are not wrong, but they avoid the important and focus on the trivial, and will not tell the insured that the first month is 1 yuan, and the next month is to be charged according to normal fees, ranging from dozens to 200. Many customers do not know what they have bought after deducting fees for one or two years.
They thought that they could spend $1, and the insurance company would pay $6 million (it was a pie in the sky).
Free mobile phones are only given to special policy numbers like 6666, 8888, and if you win and receive a text message, you will not be reminded to redeem it if you do not do so yourself.
(This is another pitfall for the insured) Free 60,000 RMB critical illness insurance is short-term. If you only rely on this, and there is no other commercial insurance, if you really have a critical illness, what can 60,000 RMB be used for? It cannot solve the problem, and your life will start to run naked.
Currently, the state is also cracking down on the misleading of Internet insurance sales.
So overall, there is no problem with the platform and no problem with the product. There is a problem with the professionalism and professional ethics of the salesperson.
It is suggested that the questioner consider carefully and comprehensively. In fact, the products of many offline insurance brokerage companies are more extensive, and customers have more opportunities and products to choose from, and some products have better cost-effectiveness than Internet products.
I have helped 59 Internet customers to insure offline products, saving 2,000 to 3,000 yuan per person per year.
If you have any questions, please feel free to communicate with me.
Me: Mingya insurance broker, with 3 years of enterprise management training experience, has served nearly 1,000 enterprise users and cooperated with more than 100 insurance companies. Before insurance, I will start from the customer’s needs and customize insurance products for customers. During insurance, I will compare three insurance companies and try my best to get the best underwriting results for customers. After insurance, I will help customers organize and manage policies, so that customers can rest assured and worry-free.
Grow with each customer for life.
I hope my answer can help the questioner!
According to the definition of the insurance regulatory authority, internet insurance refers to insurance business in which the policyholder can independently complete the entire insurance process after clicking the insurance link.
In this process, the policyholder does not need to sign, the insurance consultant does not need to sign, and all steps can be completed by the policyholder independently.
Although there is not much "sense of ceremony" when buying Internet insurance, and there may not even be a printed paper contract, this does not affect the effectiveness and legal effect of the electronic version of the contract.
This model is a bit like the old "telephone sales" style of assembly-line work, but there is a fatal problem with buying insurance this way, and that is - the follow-up service may not keep up.
Insurance is usually a long-term contract that lasts for dozens of years. When we buy insurance, should we seriously consider whether the "intermediary" we choose is an "insurance intermediary" who can accompany us for a long time and provide us with services many years later?

Thank you for your help
From the past to the present, I have always opposed any form of slander and verbal abuse, and I cannot accept such personal attacks.
In a civilized society, we can accept everything, but we must eliminate these scoundrels.
If we don't look at political parties and factions, the first thing to resist is this kind of uncivilized style.
From the moment you started sending me Facebook friend requests, to making sarcastic posts, to your attempt to post what you claimed to be my home address and my father's name on social media, I have chosen not to respond.
After that, you not only continued to tag me at the frequency of six meals a day, but also continued to discuss some implicit and humiliating remarks about me with your so-called friends on Facebook, such as my appearance, figure, good upbringing, whether to plant strawberries on the bed, or whether to insert them. I just let it go.
Little did I know that later on, I received more messages from my friends about your Facebook account with a photo of you and words of sexual harassment.
I'm sorry, as a woman, I can't stay silent anymore.
Since my news of reporting to the police was uploaded, you have not restrained yourself at all, but have become even more arrogant.
I don't care what your political background is, and I don't care what your identity is. In our society, it is necessary to respect both men and women.
Yes, you can continue with your sarcastic, veiled, humiliating, insulting remarks, you can continue to say that you're just caring and concerned about me, you can continue to think that this is not harassment, and you can even continue to deny that you made that picture, or continue to post all of your vitriolic remarks.
That's right, I can't, and I don't have the power to stop you.
I don't know you, and I don't want to know you. My looks and figure don't need your evaluation.
I don't even think there's a girl out there who would be willing to let someone humiliate her like that for fame.
A friend asked me how I was doing.
I told you so and you didn't believe me.
I don't think any girl would say she's fine after being bullied like that.
Only those who have no basic moral values would choose to hurt any woman in this way, whether at work, in society, in politics or in business.
I believe that justice lies in the hearts of the people.
I have cut out some of the comments for everyone to comment on.
No one should be able to impersonate you on your own post, right?
All I can say is that you are the public enemy of civilization.
A knowing smile
Vietnam People's Daily Online - Vietnamese Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh Attends the Third Vietnam National Digital Technology Enterprise Development Forum
During the Third Vietnam National Digital Technology Enterprise Development Forum, two main conferences were held to discuss the topics of digital technology enterprises and national digital transformation, and digital technology enterprises and COVID-19 and post-pandemic economic recovery and development.
Nguyen Manh Hung, Minister of the Ministry of Information and Communications, said that in 2021, despite the continuous spread of the Covid-19 epidemic, the number and revenue of Vietnamese digital technology enterprises still maintained a growth trend of nearly 10%.
In 2021, Vietnam has cultivated a large number of typical digital products, which focus on solving the major problems facing Vietnam. Many digital products have gone abroad, and the ranking of Vietnam's digital technology has been improved.
Minister Ruan Mengxiong called on digital technology enterprises to take on the responsibility of developing a national digital transformation platform and take on the task of developing these national digital platforms as a national mission.
At the forum, the leaders of various departments and state organs shared the ideas and solutions for mobilizing and gathering all social resources to develop Vietnamese technology enterprises, working together to promote the digital transformation of the country, and post-epidemic economic recovery.
Prime Minister Fan Mingzheng emphasized in his speech at the forum that digital transformation is the inevitable path of the world and the objective demand of development.
Digital transformation has become a global issue, and digital transformation serves the whole people, so it is necessary to mobilize the whole people to participate.
People and enterprises are the core, main body, goal and driving force of digital transformation.
Therefore, all policies must be for the people and enterprises.
Prime Minister Fan Mingzheng emphasized that the digital transformation should reflect the national spirit, and it should be mainly driven by internal forces, with strategies, long-term and decisive factors, and external forces as important and breakthrough points.
He also believes that digital transformation should drive in-depth development and sustainable development, participate in the prevention and control of the new coronavirus, economic recovery and development, and respond to subsequent changes, overcome the phenomenon of natural resource depletion, help green transformation, and develop green energy.
Digital transformation requires participation in the establishment of databases related to the protection and promotion of national cultural values, historical traditions, national customs and traditions, and promote the digital transformation of banking, taxation, land management and development, and logistics and other fields.
The biggest goal of digital transformation is to make the people happier and the country more prosperous and developed.
Prime Minister Fan Mingzheng required that all levels of government, all levels of institutions and enterprises need to increase leadership and guidance in the development of digital technology, improve their understanding of digital transformation, continue to formulate and improve the system of digital transformation, strengthen national management and promote the development of digital technology enterprises based on the spirit of respect, communication, listening, positive and proactive.
During the forum, Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh attended the award ceremony for the 2021 “Made in Vietnam” Outstanding Digital Product Award and the opening ceremony for “Made in Vietnam” digital products.

High-speed rail actually at home
Address: No. 555, North Road of High-speed Railway Check map
The home appliances here are quite complete, with many brands, all of which are well-known brands.
During Double Twelve, I went to the “Hanson” water purifier store to look at water purifiers. There was a promotion going on in the store and the price was more favorable.
Actually Home has a total of 11 floors, from -2 to 9, -1 and -2 are all parking places, and parking is free during the day!
The surrounding area is not very good. There are only a few restaurants and hardware stores, and the food in the restaurants is average.
This elevator is also very speechless. It is like having a big illness. It goes back and forth between floor -2 and -1. It does not stop at the floor I press. It is also very speechless to go from the safety passage to the first floor. It directly leads to a furniture store. When the furniture store is closed, you can't get out of the safety passage!
Actually Home is still in need of improvement, and there are many places that have not been developed.
Address: No. 555, High-Speed Railway North Road, Sai Ba Ke District, with convenient transportation, a large parking lot, and free during the day.
Environment: to be honest, the store is big, with 8 to 9 floors, and you can buy all the furniture, home appliances, and all kinds of small things that you want at home, and many famous brand merchants have settled in the store, such as Mu Si, Opai, Huati, Laoban, Fengchuangzhijia, Hansun, Yak, Youbang, Silian, Fupinju, Wanjiale, Dajiaren, Zhonglian, Midea, Yadan... The brand is really too many. I can only remember so many. It is a good place to buy products. If you are tired, you can sit on the sofa to rest.
Recently, I wanted to buy a comfortable sofa. My friend said that there are many sofas to choose from here. After looking at Gujia Home Furnishing and Meike Home Furnishing, I felt that it was okay, but the price was a bit expensive, so I was still hesitating.
The Urumqi Home Furnishing Mall Channel of Dianping provides you with the latest merchant information such as the address, phone number and business hours of the High-speed Railway Home Depot, and if you are looking for a decoration company, just go to Dianping.

The main stream of the Yangtze River achieves full coverage of water green comprehensive service areas - Xinhua News Agency
China News Service, Wuhan, December 11 (Reporter Wang Xian) The Fuling Water Green Comprehensive Service Area in Chongqing was completed and put into operation as scheduled on the 10th. This was the second Water Green Comprehensive Service Area to officially operate in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River after the Luzhou Water Green Comprehensive Service Area in Sichuan was officially put into operation on the 8th.
So far, the water green comprehensive service area has covered the upper, middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River.
Qiu Jianhua, Deputy Director of the Yangtze River Navigation Management Bureau of the Ministry of Transport, introduced that previously, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, Jiangsu and other provinces have built and operated 10 water green comprehensive service areas in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, which have been recognized by a large number of seafarers and played an important role in promoting the high-quality development of Yangtze River navigation.
The full coverage of the water green comprehensive service area is another milestone event in the construction of the Yangtze River green shipping, and the Yangtze River ship pollutant receiving and shipping service capacity have been significantly improved.
It is reported that the water-based green comprehensive service area is an important facility for providing all-round production and living services for a large number of ships and crew, and helping a large number of crew to solve the "urgent, difficult, worry, and hope" problems.
The two water green comprehensive service areas in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River have been built and put into operation this time. They integrate life services, production services, and government services into one, with green and environmental protection as the theme, and ship repair and ship emergency rescue services as the characteristics. They implement the “one docking and multiple services” in the port, which will make the work of the crew sailing in the Yangtze River more efficient and life more convenient.
Three US aircraft carriers gather in the vicinity of China The most powerful weapon in the US Navy's arsenal made a rare visit to Guam 2022-01-17 Multi-dimensional report by the pro-China media Multi-dimensional: the latest news of Sino-US relations: the latest satellite images show that three US aircraft carriers are gathering in the vicinity of China; US media also disclosed that one of the most powerful weapons in the US Navy's arsenal made a rare visit to Guam, sending an important signal to US allies and enemies in the Indo-Pacific region.
According to the Chinese think tank "South China Sea Strategic Situation Perception Platform", on January 9, a satellite found the US military aircraft carrier "Carl Vinson" (USS Carl Vinson) near the Balabac Strait.
The Balabac Strait connects the South China Sea and the Sulu Sea, and is a strategic location on the first island chain in the Western Pacific.
The platform is expected to deploy "Carl Vinson" to the South China Sea.
This is the first deployment of the F-35C fighter jet and the CMV-22 "Osprey" carrier-based transport aircraft aboard the aircraft carrier "Carl Vinson".
In addition to the USS Carl Vinson, the US aircraft carrier currently cruising in the Pacific also includes the USS Abraham Lincoln (USS Abraham Lincoln), which departed from the United States on January 3.
The USS Lincoln also carried the F-35C carrier-based fighter squadron for the first time, which is under the 314th Fighter Attack Squadron of the U.S. Marine Corps.
In addition to the two aircraft carriers mentioned above, the US Navy currently has the USS Ronald Reagan, which is docked in Yokosuka, Japan, deployed in the Asia-Pacific region.
The aircraft carrier battle group also includes the missile cruiser "Champlain Lake" and the missile destroyer "Stockdale".
Three US aircraft carriers gathered around China, and the most powerful weapons made a rare visit to Guam. On January 17, 2022, the "South China Sea Strategic Situation Perception Platform" released the latest satellite images, showing that three US aircraft carriers were gathering around China.
(Weibo @South China Sea Strategic Situation Perception) The three aircraft carriers of the United States gather in the surrounding areas of China, and the rare visit of the most powerful weapon to Guam. On January 17, 2022, the U.S. military's carrier-based transport aircraft CMV-22B flight route.
(Weibo @ South China Sea Strategic Situation Perception) According to the American Cable News Network (CNN) on January 17, one of the most powerful weapons in the U.S. naval arsenal made a rare visit to Guam last weekend.
The Ohio class nuclear submarine USS Nevada, which carries 20 Trident (Trident) ballistic missiles and dozens of nuclear warheads, entered the U.S. Naval Base in Guam on Saturday (January 15).
Three US aircraft carriers gather around China, and the most powerful weapon makes a rare visit to Guam. Analysts believe that this is a signal sent to allies and enemies in the increasingly tense situation in the Indian-Pacific region.
This is the first visit to Guam by a U.S. ballistic missile submarine since 2016, and the second public visit to Guam since the 1980s.
Three U.S. aircraft carriers gathered around China, and the most powerful weapons made a rare visit to Guam. China has built a large number of military facilities in the South China Sea in recent years.
This is Yongshu Island in the Nansha Islands of China.
(South China Sea Research Forum) The US Navy said in a statement that the visit of the Ohio-class nuclear submarine "Nevada" to Guam this time strengthened cooperation between the United States and its allies in the region, demonstrated the United States' capabilities, flexibility, combat readiness, and continued commitment to the security and stability of the Indo-Pacific region.
A ballistic missile submarine is often referred to as a "boomer" submarine.
The whereabouts of the 14 "rumbling" submarines in the U.S. Navy fleet are usually strictly kept secret.
The secrecy surrounding ballistic missile submarines has made the "Thunderbolt" submarine "the most important survival weapon in the nuclear triad", and this system also includes the land-based launch well ballistic missiles, as well as the B-2 and B-52 bombers that can carry nuclear warheads.
When talking with friends about the recent 26% decline of Meta, the market value evaporated $2510 billion, and Zuckerberg responded "facing unprecedented competition". What is the reason?
Meta (formerly Facebook) is essentially an advertising company, and its revenue comes mainly from advertising. Today, advertising companies that make money have their own traffic channels.
Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and so on, no matter what kind of function positioning, they are all Meta's traffic channels.
Moreover, Meta is the largest "advertising alliance". Many apps use Meta's advertising to achieve monetization through Meta's advertising platform.
But times have changed.
First, due to the adjustment of Apple's privacy policy, it is difficult for Meta to obtain user data information, which affects the efficiency of advertising delivery.
Apple's current privacy policy is user-friendly. It will clearly prompt users whether to allow the app to obtain their information. Most people's normal reaction is definitely not to allow it.
If Google stabs again, the impact on Meta's revenue will be even greater.
Second, the Chinese factor in Meta's previous revenue growth has also weakened (the proportion of this factor is uncertain, but it does exist).
Everyone knows that Meta has no business in China, but this understanding is not accurate.
Each year, at least 10% of Meta's revenue comes from China, mainly from Chinese companies doing overseas business.
Meta has a few hundred people in its Hong Kong office, and several major agents in mainland China.
Chinese companies want to expand their overseas markets, and Meta is an unavoidable advertising channel. Most of the money spent is given to Meta.
It is interesting that ByteDance's TT is now one of Meta's main competitors, but Meta made a lot of money from ByteDance in the past two years.
All domestic agents are helping Byte to place ads at Meta, and Meta's performance in Greater China is also very good.
I haven't specifically looked into it lately, but it's definitely not going to be better than before.
The stage of large-scale money burning by Chinese companies overseas has passed.
Third, the expansion of new traffic channels is not smooth.
Facebook is getting older and newer platforms such as TT are not in the hands of Meta.
The biggest problem is not just the decline in income, but the lack of growth expectations.
The capital market not only looks at the income, but more importantly, it looks at the expectations for the future.
Clearly, Meta's expectations were not met.
In order to tell a new story to the market, Zuckerberg talked about the “metaverse”.
The metaverse is indeed one of the directions of the future, but the implementation cycle of the metaverse is relatively long, and this story will not be enough to support Meta's market value in the next two or three years.
Therefore, the next two years should be a difficult time for Meta.
Don't look at Facebook's current glory. It has an annual revenue of 100 billion to 200 billion US dollars. In fact, Facebook now has a strong sense of crisis. Compared with other Internet enterprises and high-tech companies, there is no good and safe moat.
Although his several social software have a high daily active users now, and they are also mainstream social software, such as Facebook, WhatsApp and so on, but in the face of TikTok's rapid development, Facebook has no confidence, and the subversion is just a blink of an eye.
As for the unattainable concept of the Metaverse, there is no hope of success in a short period of time, so Facebook is very dangerous. This is also the fundamental reason why Zuckerberg changed the company's name and continued to search for new tracks. However, I think his choice of tracks is wrong and a dead end. The above are some of my thoughts for your reference.
