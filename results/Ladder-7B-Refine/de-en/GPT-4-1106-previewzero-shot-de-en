The goods cost less than 20 euros.
The fee is equivalent to 40% of the value of the goods.
I am a #PRS_ORG# large customer and so it is no problem for me.
I just need a number or instructions on what I should include with the package so it can be tracked by you as a return.
I ordered the #PRS_ORG# a few days ago... for 249€.
Today, it costs 179€.
I find that very annoying, to be honest.
Do I need to cancel the order and re-order for the better price or is there another way to get a credit?
I also think that children should not be expected to take on a parental role for their younger siblings.
However, I think it is also good for older siblings to take care of the little ones in moderation.
To take a quick look, to give a quick hand, to bring the bottle, etc.
This way, they learn responsibility, help in the family and are involved.
As long as they can still be children themselves, I don't see a problem with that.
If your K1 is occupied for the short time alone and it's OK for him, that's good.
You can best judge whether this is suitable for your children.
It's not like he's supposed to wrap K2 and accompany him for hours while he falls asleep.
Legally, it is probably questionable.
Perhaps that is why the psychologist made the statement.
Because if something were to actually happen like a fire, break-in, earthquake, alien invasion, etc. it would actually be too much responsibility for K1 to take care of K2.
Whether that is a risk you want to take is, of course, up to you ;)
Please help me find the title of a book!
I remember reading a crime/thriller a few years ago and I can remember almost the entire plot, but the title just won't come to me. Maybe someone here knows...
The story was about fear and how to treat it.
At the beginning of the story, a zookeeper commits suicide by dousing himself with food and going into the enclosure with his big cats.
The case is taken over by a policewoman who, after a short investigation, comes across his therapist, who runs a clinic where he treats patients with anxiety.
The commissioner has a little niece who also has a fear (of fire) and ends up with this therapist.
There are more suicides and there is another protagonist - a photographer who is anonymously commissioned before each suicide to go to the place of the suicide and document it and post the photos on the internet.
At any rate, it turns out that this therapist is running a kind of underground therapy group where the patients are implanted with a chip that suppresses a fear center in the brain, and the patients ultimately have to face their fears in the most extreme way.
(A woman jumps out of a window, another drives herself to death on purpose)
This facing of fear is called "the fight" in the book.
In the end, there is a big showdown in the clinic that had to do with a fire.
That is the rough plot, I am pretty sure that the book was originally written by a French author/writer.
If anyone knows of this action or can even tell me the title of the book, I would be very happy.
Oh dear, I don't have the password for the Wi-Fi.
I have to contact my husband first.
But that can take a while.
What steps do I need to take after that?
Is it also possible to get the price difference back?
Child, 4 years old, splinter under the thumbnail
Kind, four years old, has wood splinters over the entire length under the thumbnail (outside).
I tried to pull it out with tweezers.
Very hard to grasp.
It didn't work and it hurt.
Now the child reacts hysterically when we try.
No chance.
Tomorrow I'm going to the doctor.

The LokSound 5 is the most important member of the LokSound family.
By combining a digital decoder and sound module on a single circuit board, we achieve dimensions of only 30mm x15.5mm and can thus be installed in almost every locomotive of the H0 and 0 gauge.
LokSound 5 decoders are offered with all common interfaces and always come with an 11x15mm "sugar cube" speaker and a sound capsule kit.
Like all family members, the LokSound5 is a true multi-protocol decoder.
It supports the DCC data format as well as Motorola®, Selectrix® and M4.
In the DCC format, 14 to 128 speed steps are as natural as 2- and 4-digit addresses and up to 32 functions.
Thanks to RailComPlus®, the decoders automatically register with a suitable digital central unit.
It supports all DCC programming modes and, thanks to RailCom®, the CV values can be read on the main track with suitable central units.
For centrals that can only program CVs 1-255, there are auxiliary registers.
Motorola® users benefit from up to 28 speed dial steps with 255 addresses.
Three additional Motorola addresses allow the triggering of 16 functions.
An integrated programming mode also makes it possible to reprogram the venerable Control Unit 6021.
The M4 protocol allows automatic registration with mfx®-compatible central units.
The LokSound 5 decoder recognises Märklin® braking sections as well as ZIMO® HLU braking commands or the Lenz® ABC system.
Braking with DCC brake components or with direct current is also possible.
In addition, it also stops at a Selectrix® brake diode.
An ABC pendulum train automation allows automatic pendulum between two stations.
The LokSound 5 decoder can be used on analog DC and AC railways.

Due to Omicron: Johnson wants to push ahead with booster vaccinations
New Omicron cases are causing concern for politicians and scientists in the UK.
Therefore, all adults in England who are eligible should receive a vaccination offer by New Year's Day.
London - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to speed up the Corona booster vaccinations in the face of rapidly rising Omicron numbers even faster than previously aimed for.
Every adult in England should have the chance to receive a booster dose by the end of the year, if at least three months have passed since their second vaccination, Johnson said in a pre-recorded video message to his compatriots on Sunday evening.
So far, the target date was the end of January.
The UK government will provide additional support to speed up vaccination programmes in the devolved nations of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
We are facing an emergency in the face of the Omicron variant, which is why it is urgently necessary to strengthen the vaccination protection, said Johnson.
The good news is that the level of protection can be increased again with a third vaccine dose.
"Get boosted now!" Johnson said.
A further 1,239 Omicron cases were recorded in the UK on Sunday, taking the total to 3,137.
Compared to the previous day, this was an increase of a whopping 65 percent. dpa
Will the full amount be refunded from the purchase price when I pick it up?
I'm for everyone introducing themselves with pronouns
I sent off an application.
Today, the invitation to a conversation came by email.
I want to respond to the email.
But unfortunately, the name is not "Peter," but a somewhat more complicated name.
I Googled it and depending on the cultural background it is either a man or a woman.
**I have no idea how to write the email now.
Can someone please help me?
** I'm a foreigner and I don't want to step on any official's toes.
Conclusion: everyone should introduce themselves with pronouns.
I have a total of 5 books on it.
4 of them go.
Only the one I bought today doesn't work
Clearly, the chair had a hidden defect at the time of sale.
How can such a damage to the upholstery occur otherwise after 9 months?
First on #PRS_ORG#.
This has been working for about
Not more than 14 days.
Therefore, I have always bought the last books via the website and then read them on the #PRS_ORG#.
I bought 6 #PRS_ORG# but wanted to buy 8.
But there were none.
Now they are available again and I would like you to please add 2 chairs to my order and bill me for them.
[CW] The feeling when I can't help.
Content warning: I'm going to get a bit graphic here about domestic violence.
I just need to get something off my chest.
I (21) come into contact with the victims (and perpetrators) of domestic violence for professional reasons.
A topic that really gnaws at me and unfortunately occurs all too often is that many victims do not allow themselves to be helped or think that we cannot help them.
I am well aware that we cannot do everything and that it is not perfect.
But there are fewer things in my profession that move me more than when I can't do anything in such situations.
I see the bruises, the blood, the desperate eyes...
But even in a conversation behind closed doors, with the perpetrator far out of sight and earshot, I can't reach everyone.
I don't know what the reason is, maybe it's fear, fear of revenge, fear of leaving the familiar social environment, fear of taking the children away from it.
What I always want to make clear to everyone, sometimes even very close to tears, is that everyone deserves to be able to live without violence.
I want all women to know that they don't have to just accept violence.
I often wish I could help in every case... I know I can't.
However, it will never get easier.
Please, always remember that you are worth living without violence, that is so incredibly important.
"Arcane" on Netflix: What is the series about "League of Legends" worth?

Basketball Bundesliga: Derby debacle for the MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg against the Merlins Crailsheim
At least on youngster Johannes Patrick, you could rely.
Nothing again: For the second time within less than three months, the Giants lost in Crailsheim - and how!
Before the game, Ludwigsburg's coach John Patrick, looking back on the cup defeat in early October against the Hakro Merlins Crailsheim, said: "We still have some anger in our bellies".
After the game, however, it did not subside - but rather increased in the face of the 61:72 (28:38) defeat in the basketball Bundesliga.
More than the bare result, though, it was the manner of the performance that was so disappointing.
As an example, a statistic is mentioned that expresses the entire dilemma: The three-point percentage was just 13 percent, 4 hits (all by the young Johannes Patrick) out of a whopping 31 attempts - any questions?
John Patrick provided the answer: "We just weren't focused enough after the win in Tenerife and didn't implement what we'd trained."
Namely, to move the ball.
His counterpart Sebastian Gleim reacted quite differently: "It's a great game to win against Ludwigsburg for the second time," said the happy coach.
"It felt like 10,000 people were there."
On Saturday, only 750 visitors were allowed in the Hohenlohe Arena, but they got their money's worth.
Not least because of BBL top scorer T.J. Shorts, who scored 22 points and led his team.
"The best playmaker I've ever trained," Gleim praised.
While in Patrick's team the top performers like Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7) failed across the board.
Only in the last quarter (22:15) did the Giants prevent a total debacle and came within eight points after they had already been 39:59 behind.
In addition to Johannes Patrick, Justin Simon scored twelve points.
Fortunately, there is not much time to argue.
Already on Wednesday (7pm) the Giants will host the Skyliners Frankfurt, before then also in Ludwigsburg a maximum of 750 spectators.
We used to have a different email address, but I changed it.
Yes, I signed up a few months ago.
Unfortunately, all warranty claims were denied.
We have sought legal advice again and have written to them again for this reason.
We originally signed up half a year ago.
Always like a duck out of water: Max Raabe turns 59
He is able to enthuse his audience with new interpretations of songs from the 1920s and 1930s.
Currently, he is on tour with the programme "Good day, dear luck" - if he is allowed to perform.
Actually, Max Raabe wanted to celebrate his birthday on stage in Leipzig this Sunday.
But nothing comes of it.
The planned concert has been moved to May 2022 - "by order of the authorities" to contain the Corona virus.
Other of his planned appearances in the Advent season must also be cancelled for the time being, as it says on the website of the singer, who turns 59 today, and his musicians (www.palast-orchester.de).
From January, the artists then want to make up for their already 2020 postponed dates due to the pandemic.
Born on 12 December 1962 in Lünen, North Rhine-Westphalia, Max Raabe has been singing a lot and with pleasure since his youth.
In Berlin he studied opera singing, in 1986 he founded the Palast Orchester together with fellow students.
Since then, the baritone has established himself with his repertoire of schlager and chansons in the style of the Comedian Harmonists.
He has won many awards.
His live album from the "MTV Unplugged" series (2019) reached - just like his successful album "Für Frauen ist das kein Problem" (2013) - second place in the charts.
He has made it from the niche to the mainstream.
Always elegantly dressed, with his blonde hair slicked back and mindful of etiquette, Max Raabe is now an indispensable part of the current German-speaking music scene.
With the programme "Guten Tag, liebes Glück" he has been on tour since 2020. dpa
Hello #NAME#, is it also possible to get a small sample of the furniture wood in advance?
It can be added to existing furniture and so we can check beforehand if it matches in colour
It still doesn't work, I can only long for the cover page but can't turn the pages.
Federal Minister of Construction Klara Geywitz: Expropriation does not create new housing
The new Federal Minister of Construction, Klara Geywitz (SPD), has spoken out against the expropriation of large housing companies, as demanded in a referendum in Berlin.
"Expropriation does not create a single new apartment; it only changes the ownership structure," said Geywitz in an interview with the "Tagesspiegel" (Sunday).
My aim is to give tenants security that their rent will remain affordable in the years ahead.
A colourful mix of, for example, private landlords, cooperatives or housing associations is, by the way, the best protection against the formation of a monopoly.
In Berlin, the coalition of SPD, Greens and Left Party will set up an expert commission on how to deal with the result of the referendum.
However, if the situation does not improve, Geywitz did not rule out talks with the FDP in the traffic light coalition on further tightening of rental law.
The coalition agreement provides for a rent cap until 2029, a limitation of rent increases in tight housing markets and the expansion of the rent index.
I will speak with the Justice Minister to implement this as soon as possible.
If the rental market does not ease, "we will talk to our coalition partners about further steps," stressed the SPD politician.
Hello, I wanted to place an order and after a few days I noticed that I forgot the last step in the payment process.
Unfortunately, the product is now no longer available.
Do they know when it will be back in stock?
Or whether it will ever come back at all?
#PRS_ORG# with storage space (180 x #NUMBER# cm),
Voucher sounds great
Then I redeem it independently with the new order
Thank you for the quick clarification!
If the lamp is sent in March, how long does the shipping itself take?
I've already cut myself on the finger
That is absolute cheek
At least 100 killed by tornadoes in Kentucky
A devastating storm system has swept across the United States, producing numerous tornadoes.
In Kentucky alone, more than 100 deaths could be reported.
The pictures from there are reminiscent of a war zone.
In the night to Saturday, several tornadoes in the USA caused severe damage and may have claimed up to a hundred lives.
The storms left a path of destruction about 200 miles long, especially in the state of Kentucky.
Its governor, Andy Beshear, said after visiting the disaster area that everything was gone where the tornado had ripped through.
Houses, shops, government buildings - just gone.
Parts of industrial plants, roofs are in the trees.
It's hard to imagine that it's even possible.
He is expecting up to a hundred deaths in the state of Kentucky alone, and the official figures are rising by the hour.
Hi, I just saw that display #NAME# is sold out.
That's very unfortunate.
Is it still being produced?
Or has it been completely removed from the range?
Is it possible to order this display case in another country?
When will you report?
If the delivery cannot be made to my apartment, I must cancel the order!
I understand that, but can I now order the ceiling and have it delivered to Germany, which is in the shopping cart?
I had returned an article or initiated a return via the contact form and wanted to ask if it had arrived or was being processed, as I had not yet received confirmation.
Companies pay vaccination bonuses and change advertising slogans
While the federal government continues to reject proposals for a vaccination bonus, companies in Austria have taken the initiative themselves and are offering their employees cash bonuses for vaccination.
This puts them in line with the social partners ÖGB and the Chamber of Commerce, who today called for financial incentives for vaccination.
The transformation of advertising slogans into vaccination calls - following the German model - is also intended to increase the willingness to be vaccinated against Corona.
He has switched to a company that he has gossiped about.
That doesn't make his situation any better than yours.
Wait and drink tea.
It's been a year.
He obviously didn't want to stay in his old position and was looking for something else.
You can do that too.
And that he didn't like you back then: well, it doesn't matter.
He didn't like his job anyway.
There are too many variables.
Please process the cancellation.
That will then be legally relevant.
I take a screenshot.

Help with first own campaign
Cheers, Boron!
I'm currently running the adventure Over the Griffen Pass for a group of 4 friends and I want to seamlessly lead my heroes into a campaign written specifically for the players.
We're playing DSA 5.
The big arc is made, the villains and their motivations written, the individual acts thought up and now I'm in the process of writing the introductory adventure and already stumble over my own feet at the first encounter.
The premise is that the heroes are to bring a wagonload of grain from Gratenfels to a small village near Lake Thuran.
That is where the further action is supposed to develop.
A few miles from the village, the heroes are said to be ambushed by a group of goblins and lured into an ambush.
I want to give the player characters the opportunity to resolve the confrontation in different ways: Persuading, acting, threatening, recognizing the danger early on, whatever the players come up with.
Group strength: 8 common goblins, 2 with spears, 6 armed with bows and sabers
If unnoticed, the goblins lay in wait for the heroes in a hollow way and flank the wagon with three on each side armed with bows, while two with spears stop the wagon.
Should it come to a fight and the heroes lose, I have two solutions
1. The heroes are all knocked unconscious and then found and healed by the village headman's son, a half-elf.
The cart is, of course, gone.
2. Should a defeat be inevitable, this half-elf steps in with two of his servants and comes to the heroes' aid in battle.
The cart is still there, everything is great.
How appropriate do you find Deus ex Machina for solution 2?
Is the encounter too much for an introduction to the adventure?
The group of Goblins will play a crucial role later on, so they are not just cannon fodder.
EDIT: wow, I didn't expect so many answers, especially not so many great suggestions and tips.
I will definitely take a lot of your ideas on board and I have more confidence in my narratives now.
I took the lamp apart again.
And again, they have been put together.
Unfortunately, it still doesn't work.
That's why I would like to send them back anyway
Can you then send the return tickets, then I can pack the lamp and bring it to #PRS_ORG#.

Will everything be collected again or just the storage space part?
I'm fed up with Sky Sports F1
Hello dear F1 fans, over the course of the season, the quality on German Sky has decreased more and more, so I want to vent a little with this post.
First of all, today the broadcast was interrupted in the middle of the F2 race to start the F1 pre-race coverage on time.
Although the delayed start and the start accident had put the schedule far behind the planning, it would still have been possible to show the last (planned) ten minutes as well as the championship decision (!).
Apparently, however, it is the case that for legal reasons F1 has priority and therefore everything else must be restricted, so Sky DE probably had no choice.
Nevertheless, it was stupid, since Sky UK broadcast the race to the end.
Nevertheless, a little praise: the commentator Olivier Zwartyes has accompanied the difficult situation around the serious accident well.
Then there was once again rule ignorance among the commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, as both did not know that you are allowed to change tyres under a red flag.
Although this situation has already occurred in Imola, Baku and Silverstone this year, both only came to the conclusion that Verstappen was allowed to change tyres when there were corresponding radio messages on this subject to Hamilton.
At Sky UK and RTL, both commentators knew immediately that Verstappen had this opportunity.
I think that such elementary rules should simply be known if you comment on the F1 at a pay-TV channel.
It's also not the first time that guessing what the rules allow or require is now possible or required, both just have constant uncertainty on the subject of rules.
In general, I don't like the contrived comment style of Roos, but I admit that it's a matter of taste.
But seriously, even Heiko Wasser from RTL is better.
In addition, there are constant jokes that make both of them appear simply unprofessional, such as ordering coffee from the (equally clueless) reporter Peter Hardenacke or "UuuuuHD" from Ralf Schumacher.
The latter in particular causes a lot of unrest in the comment, which he apparently does not take seriously.
Not least, the advertising is simply getting out of hand at Sky, in the run-out round, Sky is the only channel that goes into advertising, as you can hear on F1TV, where only the German sound track without commentary has to do directly after the race.
Neither ServusTV nor ORF do that.
These two channels also show less advertising in the training sessions than Sky, and that as free-to-air channels.
Although one must praise Glock and Baumgartner for their work, this alone does not allow me to overlook the disadvantages.
The rest of the Sky Sports F1 schedule is also very thin and full of repeats.
Overall, Sky is really the worst German-speaking broadcaster that broadcasts the F1.
Unironically, RTL does a better job with the four races they are still allowed to broadcast, apart from the adverts.
So, at least, the grand F1 season is much less fun than it would be with a reasonable broadcaster.
I would like to hear your opinion.
Here: #PRS_ORG# pendant light, brass and multi-coloured glass x 1
Hi, I have an article that was supposed to be delivered last week and it still hasn't been delivered.
I have contacted the chat twice and have heard nothing.
The first lady told me it was going to be sent on Monday, the second lady told me yesterday that she was going to check and send an email and she never responded.
Hello, I ordered two #PRS_ORG# on 12/12/19.
One of them has already shown a defect after a relatively short time (the fabric has a hole in the front part of the chair).
I ask for your support.
Air pumps are excellent for providing additional oxygen to an aquarium.
It is also possible to operate a filter system using air lifters.
This series is offered by us in 3 variants.
Look at the table at the end of the offer.
There you can see the services compared.
If the pumps are powerful enough, you can operate entire systems with them.
If you have a large aquarium, pumps with 2 or more outlets are suitable, so that you can connect multiple outlets.
The MK series has one, two or four outlets, depending on the model. However, a fan pump is also suitable for setting an accent in the aquarium, e.g. with an air curtain (find it in our shop) or with a decoration, which turns the air bubbles into a function.
Here a treasure chest, shell or similar would be mentioned.
The MK series has a special sound-insulated construction and thus ensures low operating noise.
The installation is very easy.
The fan pump is connected to a drain or similar via a 4/6 mm air hose...and you can get started.
The fan pump should be the same, or higher than the water level and mounted externally.
If the fan pump is lower than the water level, a check valve should be installed between them.
Simply cut the air hose and insert the valve in between.
This would prevent the water from running backwards if the water from the pool ran through the pump...
If the fan pump is to be mounted outside, it should be covered and protected from moisture, like other air pumps.
The MK series pumps are pure powerhouses that use little energy
Even though we indicate a processing time of 3 days here on eBay, we pack daily and the packages are also collected daily here.
If everything is going well on the way, it goes very fast.
We just want to prevent a little bit, so that no one is upset, just because it took a little longer.
It would be so, not everyone has understanding for all the employees who also work in the logistics sector...of course, here, Corona doesn't stop.
Please do not rate badly just because the delivery is delayed, this is solely due to the parcel services.
Of course, people like to complain about these services, even though we say at the moment...they have it damn hard
This is also very different from region to region.
Don't be angry with anyone, stay healthy and we all hope that there will be better times again.
How long does it take to order the yellow ones with and without armrests?
Can you also order the legs in light here?
Amazon founder Bezos sends astronaut daughter and TV host into space
The daughter of the first American in space, a TV host and four other passengers have taken a short trip into space.
They were transported on Saturday by the "New Shepard" rocket system of the company Blue Origin founded by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.
The start and landing of the approximately ten-minute flight took place in the west of the US state of Texas.
Under a bright blue sky, Bezos personally welcomed the newly minted astronauts upon their return.
"Welcome back," said Bezos, dressed in a blue space suit, as he opened the hatch to the capsule.
To the applause of friends, family members and employees of Blue Origin, the six passengers climbed out one by one and hugged the Amazon founder.
According to Blue Origin, they were in the air for ten minutes and 13 seconds and reached an altitude of 107 kilometers.
The 74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of Alan Shepard (1923-1998), who flew into space as a NASA astronaut in 1961, after whom the Blue Origin rocket system is named, and the 50-year-old TV presenter Michael Strahan were guests of honor of the company, the other four passengers had paid for their tickets: space engineer Dylan Taylor, investor Evan Dick, technology entrepreneur Lane Bess, and his son Cameron.
Blue Origin did not disclose how much each paid for their ticket.
After the short flight, Laura Shepard Churchley recalled her father's mission.
He had to work hard and do everything himself.
She was just along for the ride, said the 74-year-old with a laugh.
Michael Strahan also expressed his enthusiasm.
He would like to return to space as soon as possible, said the moderator.
"New Shepard" flies up to 100 kilometers
The New Shepard rocket system flies largely autonomously.
The capsule, which was detached from the rocket during the flight, reached an altitude of about 100 kilometers above the Earth, experiencing weightlessness for a time, before the reusable object was slowed down by large parachutes and landed.
The International Aviation Federation and many other experts consider 100 kilometers above the Earth to be the boundary to space, but there is no binding international regulation.
It was already the third manned all-day trip by Blue Origin: In the first one in July, Amazon founder Bezos himself was on board, together with his brother Mark, an 82-year-old former US pilot and an 18-year-old Dutchman.
The second one in October was attended by the 90-year-old Canadian actor William Shatner, who became world-famous with his role as "Captain Kirk" in "Star Trek", as well as the former Nasa engineer Chris Boshuizen, the entrepreneur Glen de Vries and the deputy head of Blue Origin, Audrey Powers.
Critics have accused Bezos and Blue Origin of pushing the business of space tourism forward largely without scientific research interests for the benefit of humanity and without regard for the climate.
With the push of a button, you can easily choose whether your "Smart Stone" should permanently glow in one colour or play through its entire colour spectrum.
When set to change colours, the light stone holds a light colour for about a minute before gently transitioning to the next decorative colour.
The solid construction of the "Smart Stone" light makes it suitable for outdoor use all year round.
In snowy surroundings, her light even looks particularly good - only with a shortened light duration is to be expected, as soon as the days become shorter.
In winter, please make sure that no snow affects the function of the solar module.
"Smart Stone" uses a NiMH battery in the common mignon ("AA") format, which can be easily replaced if necessary.
You can get a suitable replacement battery from our web shop and thus extend the life of your decorative light even further.

Someone who works in biochemistry or has studied biochemistry
I am currently studying biochemistry in the first semester and I actually find the subject quite interesting in itself, and I don't mind working in the lab (I have already completed the inorganic chemistry practical course).
Of course, I had also already informed myself about career prospects before my studies, but at that time I also thought that I would definitely like to study up to a doctorate.
At the moment, however, I have doubts, especially about my career prospects.
On one hand (Studycheck etc), you keep hearing about great career opportunities and the profession being totally in demand, and on the other hand, you keep hearing about unemployed biologists and incredibly poorly paid jobs.
Therefore, I would really like to know:
1) What are you working on at the moment?
2) Are you satisfied with your work/salary?
3) What did you study/what training did you do?
4) Would you do it all again?
Thanks for your answers!
I'm really unsure at the moment and I'm thinking about possibly dropping out of university in 2022 and doing a vocational training to become an IT specialist.
If you have experiences with this, feel free to share them as well :)
Extra stress before holidays and holiday weekends
This came up for me last week.
But now I had to use my long weekend to relax from it.
That is why only now a post is being added.
Not only before big holidays, such as the Christmas holidays, is there a lot of stress at our company.
It seems that it is also available during holidays plus bridge days.
It was like this: Last week was the Assumption of the Virgin Mary, which we call "Ascension" in Switzerland.
On Friday, the vast majority of people and businesses make a bridge day, which is therefore semi-official.
Last week, therefore, a long 4-day weekend was in the offing.
So what happened last week?
Stress everywhere.
Lots of emails that had to be sent out before Ascension Day, here an order, there an order, everything *absolutely* before the long weekend.
Because... yes, because?
Because "next week then" sounds like so much time and that must not be the case?
Or because people want to do as much in a shortened week as in a normal one?
Not only was I stressed on Wednesday, but I was also mightily annoyed.
What is this self-righteousness about holidays?
Why do we have holidays if we are not allowed to enjoy them properly?!
The stress was not coming from above, the colleagues were all very independent.
My question is simply: are we the only ones, the Swiss?
Is this our reformed-evangelical way?
Or do you know it in the north as well?
Yvonne Catterfeld is looking forward to Christmas in Thuringia
Yvonne Catterfeld (42) is looking forward to Christmas in her Thuringian homeland - but she doesn't have any gifts yet.
"The nice thing is, even if there is no snow in Erfurt, you can just drive to Ilmenau in the Thuringian Forest," said the actress and singer for Hit Radio FFH.
She will get into the spirit of the festival by baking cookies and making crafts with her son.
"I love it," Catterfeld said.
But until the contemplative days, she still has a lot to do: "For the first time, I don't have any gifts yet, I have to get started now."
NEKTON-Bio supports a smooth process of moulting and feather regrowth.
NEKTON-Bio contains all the essential vitamins, amino acids, minerals, trace elements and 200,000 µg of biotin per kg.
NEKTON-Bio gives the bird a smooth and shiny plumage.
The majority of feather damage that occurs in bird keeping is due to nutritional errors.
Since the plumage consists of a protein-rich substance, a particularly rich and balanced protein diet is required for the formation of a flawless plumage.
For a functioning metabolism, the daily food must contain sufficient vitamins, minerals and trace elements.
A large part of the animal losses that occur during the moult are due to a lack of or unbalanced protein intake and/or insufficient supply of vitamins and minerals.
When composing NEKTON-Bio, the unfavourable ratio of amino acids in most plant-based feeds is explicitly taken into account and balanced.
During the application of NEKTON-Bio, no other vitamin supplement should be administered.
NEKTON-Bio is water-soluble in cold water and can be given simply via the drinking water or via the soft food.
Thanks, I found it
Unfortunately, it still doesn't work
DDR handcraft model old building E-Lok E 95 03 DRG/DR, the locomotive was in use in Silesia and Central Germany, the very rare locomotive probably comes from the conversion proposal of the model railway magazine ME issue 11/1968, used with play marks and missing parts see photos, function good, The E 95 series is a heavy freight electric locomotive of the German Reich Railway Company (DRG), which was designed for the traction of heavy coal trains in the Silesian network, the kit may also come from the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN.
A locomotive is located in the DB Museum in Halle (Saale) and is operational
The German Reich Railway Company had commissioned AEG in 1924 to submit proposals for an electric locomotive capable of transporting 2,200-ton coal trains and 530-ton passenger trains at a speed of 45 km/h on this route.
A maximum speed of 65 km/h was required.
Thus, in March 1926, the DRG determined the delivery as a 1'Co+Co1' locomotive with Tatzlager drive by AEG for the delivery of the mechanical part, and the Siemens-Schuckertwerke for the electrical part.
Between December 1927 and June 1928, six locomotives were delivered, which received the operating numbers E 95 01–06.
All of them survived the Second World War and found themselves on the territory of the future GDR afterwards.
In 1946, the locomotives were sent to the Soviet Union as reparations.
They returned to Germany until November 1952.
In the Reichsbahn repair shop in Dessau, it was determined that all six locomotives were worthy of overhaul.
[4] As the re-electrification of the central German network progressed, there was an increasing need for locomotives for heavy freight service. In 1959, the three locomotives E 95 01 to E 95 03 were overhauled, with the other machines serving as spare parts donors.
The E 04, E 44 and E 94, which were available in larger numbers, were built first.
Only when it became clear that the E 94 would not be able to increase the processing number any further, did the E 95 come into focus for processing.
[4] First, the locomotives were stationed at the Leipzig-Wahren railway depot.
They came to the Halle P depot in 1960.
They were used in their own circulation plan, mostly in front of coal trains from the Geiseltal towards Halle, Leipzig and Erfurt.
With increasing age, the complicated controls on the locomotives proved to be problematic.
It was often the case that shooters got stuck during switching operations.
Then the co-driver, who was constantly riding on this locomotive, had to use a hammer and a wooden wedge to loosen the guard during the journey.
Damage to the drive motors occurred frequently and led to months-long outages for the locomotive.
[5] Since there were enough new locomotives available at the end of the 1960s and there were no plans for a significant expansion of electric operations at that time, the Reichsbahn was able to do without old locomotives and most of the splinter groups, so that the E 95 was taken out of service.
In addition, the Deutsche Reichsbahn only wanted to staff electric locomotives with one person, which, due to the aforementioned difficulties with the machines and the visibility from the driver's cab, would have resulted in a problem in train operations.
[5] After the E 95 02 and E 95 03 were taken out of service in mid-1969, the E 95 01 was the last to follow, which quit service on October 5, 1970.
The proposed new designation 255 001 was thus never used.
All locomotives, except for the E 95 02, were dismantled.
The E 95 02 was set up as a switch heater at the main station in Halle as a replacement for the future museum locomotive E 77 10.
It took some time before the officials at the Reichsbahn could be convinced that the E 95 was worth preserving as a museum locomotive.
In 1979, the external restoration of the locomotive began with the aim of being able to present it at a vehicle exhibition in the Dessau RAW.
[5] Since then, it has been part of the Dresden Transport Museum as a non-operational museum locomotive.
In 1986, the internal completion of the locomotive took place.
The locomotive is being cared for in the DB Museum in Halle (Saale).
Since 1995, employees of the Traditionsgemeinschaft Bw Halle P have been working on the operational restoration of the locomotive.
In April 2015, the locomotive could be presented for the first time at an exhibition in the Museum Bw Arnstadt with new internal and external paintwork, where the transformers were checked and five drive motors were operational.
The locomotives were used on the Silesian Mountain Railway and the branch lines until 1945, where they proved themselves due to their reliable drive and low maintenance requirements.
In February 1945, the machines were relocated to Leipzig for the central German network.
Its main area of operation was initially Silesia
H0 hand-made model in OVP, good function, optical rework on the locomotive is necessary, dusty, with play marks, basement smell!!!, very rare hand-made model, very small edition - possibly the kit also comes from the small-series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN
The packaging may have labels and storage marks.
Yes, the F-parts are it
I received a bed from you.
However, there were problems with one part.
The middle beam is held up by two feet. Unfortunately, these are too narrow and the beam cannot be mounted on the feet.
What do we do now?
I can't put the bed together.
The middle beam is held up by two feet, which are unfortunately produced incorrectly.
The middle bar does not fit into the intended holder.
So I get new ones sent to me.
When will they be sent off?
No flats.
These are, according to the assembly instructions, the right ones in terms of shape, they were just too narrow
But that doesn't matter.
As long as they fulfil their purpose
They are not flat with me
Could I get this sent to me?
Hello #NAME#, shall I explain the problem to you again?
Residential fire with two minor injuries and high damage
Two people were slightly injured in a fire in a residential building in Upper Bavaria.
In addition, an estimated damage in the six-digit euro range has occurred, as the police reported on Sunday.
The fire had apparently spread from a carport to the adjacent house in Kinsau (Landsberg am Lech district).
Two residents were taken to the hospital with minor smoke inhalation on Sunday, according to reports.
The exact cause of the fire was initially unknown, but the police did not suspect arson.
The Fürstenfeldbruck Criminal Investigation Department has taken over further investigations.
But it will arrive much later
And I have to pay shipping costs again
To debunk fake news - Biontech CEO publishes vaccination photo
Uğur Şahin posted a photo of his first vaccination in early 2021 on the social network "LinkedIn"
Biontech CEO Uğur Şahin had not previously spoken publicly about his vaccination status.
Now the entrepreneur has published a photo showing his corona vaccination.
The illness of a friend had moved him to do so, Şahin said.
The CEO and co-founder of the Mainz-based company Biontech, Uğur Şahin, has published a photo showing him receiving a vaccination against the coronavirus.
There were false claims on social media that I was not vaccinated.
In fact, my wife and I have received three doses of the Biontech-Pfizer vaccine," wrote Şahin on Friday in a post on the network "LinkedIn".
"For months, friends have been urging me to post a photo of me getting the vaccine to combat these false rumors."
So far, he has refused this, because the communication should not be about him.
But a call last week changed his mind: "I was deeply saddened when I learned that an old school friend of mine is currently fighting for his life.
He is fighting a severe case of Covid-19 and has been on a ventilator for three weeks.
The school friend and his family are not vaccinated, Şahin continued.
He did not ask for the reasons.
"The most common cause, however, seems to be fear, which is often fanned by misinformation and mistrust."
Fear is difficult to combat with facts, sometimes it is better to share personal experiences.
An interview with Deutsche Welle is circulating on the internet, in which Uğur Şahin says he is not vaccinated.
However, the video was created in December 2020, as Deutsche Welle itself clarified.
"It is currently not legally possible for me to get the vaccine myself," said Şahin at the time.
There is a prioritisation in Germany when it comes to the vaccination of the vaccine.
In the meantime, the prioritisation has long been lifted - and the Biontech CEO has been vaccinated three times, according to his own statements.
Fire in substation: tens of thousands of people without electricity
On Friday evening, the lights went out in several municipalities in North Rhine-Westphalia: no more electricity and in many cases probably no heating either.
A fire had disabled a substation.
After a fire with severe damage to a substation, tens of thousands of people in the Rhein-Sieg district in North Rhine-Westphalia had to do without electricity for around 24 hours.
On Friday evening, the fire caused the lights to go out for 41,000 affected residents and residents in several municipalities.
The utility Westnetz reported that on Saturday, numerous emergency power generators were in operation until the large-scale disruption was finally completely resolved late in the evening.
Firefighters and helpers and helpers from the THW provided support in the municipalities.
Authorities offered care places in schools and called for help from neighbors.
The utility company thanked those affected for their patience and the helpers for their efforts.
We are very aware that the last 24 hours have brought significant restrictions.
We would also like to thank the affected municipalities, the district, the fire departments and the THW for their tireless efforts," said the head of the Primary Technology department, Florian Witt, in a statement on Saturday evening.
The repair of the damage will take a few more days, as the Westnetz fitters were only able to put some of the lines back into operation provisionally, he explained.
According to the company, a technical defect led to the fire.
Electricity is flowing again
The fire that broke out at around 7.15 p.m. on Friday has severely damaged parts of the 10,000-volt switchgear at the Neunkirchen-Seelscheid substation, according to Westnetz.
There, extensive cleaning and repair work is needed.
At the same time, a connection to a 30,000-volt voltage level was created.
With the help of this bypass, the power supply is again available.
Since Saturday at 6 p.m., more than 21,000 people in Much and Ruppichteroth have had electricity again.
Another 20,000 residents of Neunkirchen-Seelscheid were gradually connected from 9:30 p.m.
Since 11:15 p.m., those last affected by the outage have also had electricity.
Over 80 fitters from Westnetz and partner companies were deployed.
The authorities had also called for help from neighbours after setting up an emergency power supply for important buildings on Saturday afternoon.
"It is now important that citizens take care of older or single people in their neighbourhood and inform the local fire stations if help is needed," explained district administrator Sebastian Schuster (CDU) after a crisis meeting.
When setting up and operating emergency power generators, the focus was mainly on the residents of nursing homes.
In addition, according to authorities, temporary care places were set up in schools for those people who could not take care of themselves or who needed medical devices that were dependent on the flow of electricity or who needed medical care.
Guten Tag!
Unfortunately, the ceiling in Germany is sold out.
Can I buy them from you and pay in Euros?
It is the day blanket #PRS_ORG# in blue-green.
I hope you have a nice day too and please stay healthy ♡
But I can't mount the substructure on the table top.
It is Custom #NAME#.
There are three versions of it.
We wanted those with table tops with a diameter of #NUMBER#
We have a diameter of 155cm.
Today my #PRS_ORG# arrived, but I can't slide them together to shorten them.
Can you help me with that?
Otherwise, I would have to send them back, as they are not suitable for the purpose.
I would appreciate feedback
Yes, that is really easier!
Then we'll do it this way!
Can you send me the return label by email?
The repair is now complete.
I had already tried this before the chat.
Before the purchase, however, I had not restarted the E-#PRS_ORG#.
Should I do it now?
I find such a low credit almost impertinent.
We do not agree with that
Nordic Combined: Riiber wins
The German Nordic Combined skiers Fabian Rießle and Julian Schmid have sprinted onto the podium at the World Cup in Otepää, Estonia.
The duo had to give up once again to the outstanding Norwegian Jarl Magnus Riiber, who had already started with a large lead after the ski jump.
Return of order number #NUMBER#
When will the money be transferred back into my account?
Yes, we both updated it and are using version 4.5...
It could be that they have already heard about problems.
I bought a book directly with my #PRS_ORG#, it seems to be on it too.
When I try to open it, the message pops up, oops!
This document could not be opened.
If the file is faulty, contact customer service.
As far as I can tell, it's a #PRS_ORG# epub file.
Can they help me?
Chat connection is gone and now?
I have to work in between!
To ensure an even and clean paint application, you should clean the parts with some soapy water to remove dust, grease and fingerprints, rinse with clear water and dry.
Before you put the brush on the model for the first time with a new color, it is recommended to practice 2 to 3 strokes.
You can do this on the later invisible inside of the building parts or on a yogurt cup.
The first mark on the part
Draw the brush stroke by stroke evenly.
A slight overlap of the paint layers later results in a uniform surface.
Avoid swiping the brush back and forth quickly.
This creates unrealistically large areas.
A model is not a garden fence.
Start with the light colors.
Otherwise, the dark ones could shine through later.
Metallic tones and metallic colours are added at the very end with a separate brush.
Otherwise, unsightly metal streaks can occur when they are mixed with normal paints.
Let the painted parts dry for a day before you install them.
The models achieve their original appearance through the decals or stickers.
From emblems on aircraft to ship names to trim and badges on car models: the decals give the model the finishing touch.
Apply the decals in the correct order while the parts are still easily accessible.
An aircraft cockpit can be more easily covered up before it is installed in the fuselage.
Even more important than the right tools like scissors, tweezers and a toothpick when sticking are time, patience and a steady hand.
Cut out each needed decal individually and lay them out for yourself.
Decals are also called water-slide decals because you briefly wet the back of them until the backing paper turns dark with the moisture.
Then you just slide the picture a little bit off the paper and place the piece on the corresponding place on the model (which you also pre-wetted).
While holding the decal in place on the model with a tool, you pull the backing paper off to the side.
Caution: Always check first to see if the image is in the right place before sliding it completely off the paper, so that it does not stick to your finger, wrinkle, or even tear.
Suck up excess water with a household cloth.
Warning: Not suitable for children under 3 years
I can only open a book for a short time, once I look for something else then I can't read the book anymore and have to log out and log in and reload the book and find the place where I was reading up to.
I have already communicated with you on Saturday.
Can I get this by email?
Also for all 3 packages?
Because the lamp arrived in 3 separate packages at my place
OK, thanks anyway!
Then I will buy elsewhere once the money is back.
But can I get it back without any problems?
Fertility treatment with private health insurance / What is an "insurance case"?
Hello everyone,
We have been in fertility treatment for some time, now that it comes to billing the private health insurance, they are suddenly standing in our way.
One after the other:
We had applied for the fertility treatment in advance with the private health insurance and received approval for 3 attempts.
The attempts were in no way (e.g. time frame, success, etc.) restricted.
The first attempt led directly to a successful pregnancy and birth and was billed to the private health insurance.
Some time later, we tried to have a second child, and went through 2 (unsuccessful) attempts, but we had not yet settled these with the private health insurance.
We applied again for reimbursement from the private health insurance and were again granted 3 more attempts.
After a few more attempts (we did more attempts than promised, of course, the most expensive ones are reimbursed by the private health insurance), we submitted the bills to the private health insurance and got the nasty surprise: instead of 5 attempts (2+3), the private health insurance will only reimburse 3 attempts.
The reason: With the pregnancy/birth, the remaining 2 attempts of the first commitment fall away.
The second child wish is a new insurance case.
According to the terms and conditions, however, "The insurance event begins with the start of treatment and ends when there is no longer a need for treatment."
The questions for the experts in the round here:
* Who is right here, the private health insurance (only 3 attempts are reimbursed) or us (5 attempts are to be reimbursed)?
* Would the private health insurance have had to point out to us in the promises that with a birth the further attempts would expire?
* Is the desire for a second child really a new insurance case?
The infertility (caused by blocked fallopian tubes) is not cured by the first child.
It would be great if the experts here would give their opinion.
Thanks in advance for your help!
Can you please email me the three options and tell me how I can best reach them again?
Okay.
We will not order from them again.
If they add my sales and my friend #NAME#'s (same address) they have obviously lost a good customer.
They can pass this on to their manager.
That is not competitive.
Yesterday my colleague told me that the refund was initiated and now you're telling me that I have to return the item first.
I can't help it that the chest of drawers arrives completely damaged at my place
Please see what the colleague wrote in the screenshot
It clearly states that the refund was initiated and I still have not received a refund via #PRS_ORG#
They can tell their manager that they have now lost two regular customers.
My friend also ordered various pieces of furniture for our apartment via his account.
We will no longer do that.
No, the defect only appeared after a few months.
An office chair must be able to withstand normal use.
Otherwise, they are not allowed to sell it as an office chair.
Regardless, the 24-month warranty applies.
No, I am not able to get a different kind of packaging.
I will take the wardrobe apart and make it available to the transport company in this way.
Good afternoon, I have a question about your series of #PRS_ORG#
These products are advertised with additional footstools, but unfortunately we cannot find them at your store.
Can they help?
Topic of the week: The best low budget films
There is no general definition of what a low-budget film is, with exact budget limits.
Wikipedia has this to say about it:
A **low-budget film** or **low-budget movie** is a motion picture shot with little to no funding from a major film studio or private investor.
Online, you can find plenty of lists of low-budget films, such as on Letterboxd.com.
Do you know any interesting representatives of this category?
What attracts you to it?
And what do you not like at all?
I am a very good customer of yours, I have already furnished two apartments completely with your furniture.
I wanted to get the best price for the grey leather Odelle sofa.
The delivery time has now been extended again, is it now reliable?
Thank you
Best regards,
If there is no phone number, a chat where you have to wait 30 minutes is not a chat!
Unfortunately, nothing changes in the waiting position...I will give up again soon because it just doesn't work here.
Hello
"Half victory" against Belarus with high costs for the EU
According to the political expert Raphael Bossong, the EU can announce a "half victory" in the conflict with the Belarusian regime.
However, the costs are very high and mean massive violations of the rights of migrants and refugees at the Belarus border with Poland and Lithuania, said Bossong to the Evangelical Press Service (epd).
The EU has not solved the confrontation in a sustainable way, explained the researcher of the Berlin Foundation for Science and Politics (SWP).
This state of limbo - Belarus is not quite giving in, but the EU feels like a winner - is likely to continue for some time.
The way people at the border are being treated is not in line with the European Convention on Human Rights, ruled Bossong.
Apparently, there is an "increasing normalization of pushbacks" by individual EU governments.
Since the EU as a whole is not determined to oppose it, it is at the expense of fundamental rights.
This development is also weakening the cohesion in the Union.
"She can't apparently assert herself when a member state sets its mind to doing its own thing", as is currently the case with Poland, which does not even allow the EU border protection agency Frontex access to the border.
In addition, the EU is paying another price for its policy at the border with Belarus, says Bossong: A fundamental agreement on asylum policy is being made more difficult because the line "border protection, border protection, border protection" has been strengthened.
Another attempt to cross the border
According to Poland's border guard, migrants have once again tried to enter Polish territory via Belarus.
55 migrants were arrested and returned to the border overnight, a spokesperson for the agency said on Sunday.
The Polish officials were pelted with stones by the migrants near the village of Czeremsza.
According to the report, one soldier was hit in the face and had to be medically treated by a military doctor.
In total, the border guards registered 52 attempted border crossings within 24 hours.
Already on Friday evening, a group of 28 migrants had overcome the border barriers.
Thousands of people from countries like Iraq and Afghanistan had crossed or tried to cross the border between Belarus and the EU in recent months.
The EU accuses Alexander Lukashenko, the ruler in Minsk, of luring them with the prospect of entry into the EU.
Poland and Lithuania have reportedly closed off sections of the border.
The EU sanctioned Belarus and threatened airlines that bring migrants and refugees into the country.
In addition, EU commissioners traveled to the countries of origin of the people to prevent them from leaving there.
The most effective element of the EU's response was the pressure on the airlines, said Bossong.
"There, the EU has thrown its market power into the balance and demonstrated its resolve to operate with a heavy hand and extraterritorial sanctions".
Minsk must also take into account domestic political costs.
The Belarusian society is probably not prepared for the fact that the security apparatus regularly lets thousands of people through the country.
Mercedes protests after controversial Formula 1 finale
According to Mercedes, Max Verstappen committed two rule violations during the race.
Abu Dhabi - After the controversial Formula 1 finale in Abu Dhabi, Mercedes has lodged an appeal.
The Silver Arrows suspect two rule breaks in the last Grand Prix of the year.
A protest relates to an alleged infringement by Max Verstappen in the Red Bull in the last Safety Car phase, when he is said to have overtaken illegally.
A second protest was lodged against the result at the end of the race.
According to Mercedes, the protocol was not followed in accordance with the rules.
Verstappen had overtaken Lewis Hamilton in the Mercedes on the last lap and raced to his first Formula 1 title.
The manoeuvre took place shortly after the end of a safety car phase, during which the Dutch driver had overtaken the car in front of him.
I'll check that.
I'll speak to the bank and get back to you
Thanks for the support
Free admission for members: Europa-Park hosts SC Freiburg fan day
The Europa-Park, which is the namesake for the Europa-Park Stadium of the Sport-Club Freiburg, has invited to the SC Freiburg Fan Day.
As the park reports, members and season ticket holders of the sports club from Breisgau, as well as members of the fan community, were allowed to visit Europa-Park for free on this day.
In addition, there were vouchers for drinks and sausages.
The roller coaster cars lit up in red and white on this day.
Fuchsle, Ed Euromaus and many red-and-white balloons provided the perfect backdrop," said the park.
The cooperation between the Bundesliga club and the leisure park in Rust, 40 kilometres north of Freiburg, has existed since the beginning of the 1990s.
At the first SC Freiburg Fantag at Europa-Park, it was once again shown how well the partnership fits.
Seeing beaming fans having fun together on the roller coaster confirms this," says Europa-Park owner Jürgen Mack.
Why is it €#NUMBER# and not like originally 1699€?

I had a huge row with you back then when I ordered the #PRS_ORG# chest of drawers.
Judith Hermann read from her novel "Daheim"
As part of the reading series "LiteraTour Nord", author Judith Hermann read from her current novel "Daheim" at the sold-out Blue Note on Friday and also served as moderator.
She is divorced, lives in a house by the coast and listens sensitively to the night sounds at her front door.
I submitted the contact form to return an item yesterday, but have not received an email confirmation or anything similar.
My question is whether my request has been received.
Not everyone has the time for your stupid chat and cheap crap from China.
Your mistake to fix and not all of us from our household.
Contact Mrs. #NAME#.
I can't chat with them every day
We had chatted yesterday and agreed that I or Mrs. #NAME# would receive an email with a 60 Euro voucher, a new order for the #PRS_ORG# nightstand and a return label.
This email has not yet arrived.
The package wants to bring it to #PRS_ORG# today.
Please contact me

Sorry, but just because he says he's not an anti-Semite doesn't mean anything.
That's like when an AfD member says he has nothing against foreigners.
Neither of them will admit their i.
But Kollegah constantly reproduces any kind of anti-Semitic messages.
If you want to distance yourself, then you should just let it go completely.
Yes, wow, then you're just as little to be taken seriously as Kollegah.
Anyone who seriously questions evolution is just completely lost.
For my part, a god has set the whole thing in motion.
But once you're a creationist, you have to believe that the Earth is 10,000 years old and that science is just spouting nonsense.
And with that, you are an enemy of science and not to be taken seriously like Kollegah
To obtain an optimal field of view, the magnifying glass should be brought as close to the eye as possible.
The specially aplanatic-achromatic lens system allows you to use the magnifying glass practically without distortion and colour errors up to the edge zone.
Often, magnifiers are marked with magnification specifications.
These figures only apply to exactly defined conditions, which rarely correspond to the conditions of use.
To get the most out of your loupe, please follow the instructions in the "Technical Data" table (see the user manual in the packaging).
Light reflections occur on the lens surfaces of all optical devices - including magnifying glasses.
These reflections are significantly reduced by an anti-reflective coating.
When used under optimal conditions - the magnifying glass close to the eye - reflections on the lens surfaces are less noticeable.

Christmas tree sale in Schönwolde: In the municipality of Krembz, women choose the Christmas trees
Farmer Frank Diers has experienced many a curious situation when selling Christmas trees.
It is said that one man even drove home without his partner, because they could not agree.
Every year he plants about 2000 of them for this purpose.
The 56-year-old has already experienced many a curious situation.
This makes the pre-Christmas season a bit more fun, he says.
And what about the voucher?
Otherwise, I'm gone as a customer?!
After all, I received a defective delivery and now I have to pay the full price for it.
Then I will rate it accordingly!
We don't need to have a debate here about which is the better dish, but there is a certain similarity between the two.
Both consist of meat that is grilled on a rotating skewer.
And both have their names for this reason.
In German, an equivalent might be something like the "Dreher," which doesn't sound nearly as tasty.
Problems with fibre optic + Devolo DLan/Magic
We have had a new fiber optic connection in the house for a few weeks.
Unfortunately, I am now having problems setting up a stable Wi-Fi network.
Previously, I had a DSL 50 Mbit connection and used Devolo DLan, which received and sent 50 Mbit without any problems, except for a few outages.
The new fiber optic connection sends 500 Mbit to the FritzBox 7590, and these also arrive at the DLan module, which is connected to the FritzBox.
However, at the other DLan module, which sends out the Wifi, I do not get the full 500, but the further away I am from the module in the house, the less I get (i.e. I use an outlet that is 1, 2, 3, etc. rooms away from the other module).
This means that the Internet with the new fibre optic connection is now even slower on the first floor than before (\~45 Mbit).
I have also ordered a new Devolo Magic Set, which apparently uses a new technology.
This was slightly better than the DLan, but here too there were similarly large losses.
Could someone explain to me why so much Internet speed is "lost" over the power line with fiber optic?
And is LAN really the only solution?
It would be extremely time-consuming to lay LAN cables in the house now.
I'm really desperate, which is why I've created a special account here.
Therefore, I would be all the more pleased to receive a response.
When it's time to switch current accounts
Anyone who thought that now there would be peace with Giro accounts is being deceived.
While many banks have used the autumn to get their customers to confirm the fee increases of the past with all kinds of tricks, the free limits for negative interest rates are also falling.
For example, Deutsche Bank was considered relatively generous with a limit of 100,000 euros.
Now she has halved the tax-free allowance and even quartered it for daily money.
In a first step, the limit was only lowered for customers of the group's Postbank division - to 50,000 euros for current and investment accounts and to 25,000 euros for savings accounts.
However, these lower thresholds now apply to the entire Deutsche Bank, as a spokesperson confirmed on request.
And not just for new contracts, but also for "new individual agreements made with existing customers".
The Commerzbank had already gone down to a limit of 50,000 euros, which is still in force, as is the case with ING Deutschland.
The direct bank DKB, which is popular with cost-conscious customers, has lowered the exemption limits in two stages, first to 50,000 euros, and now to 25,000 euros.
After all: More than 100 banks now have a tax-free limit of 25,000 euros or less, according to figures from the internet portal Verivox.
Sparda-Bank Berlin has also arrived at 25,000 euros: However, there is still a legal dispute with the consumer centres, which even won against this regulation in the first instance at the Berlin Regional Court.
Now the banks are already discussing whether the institutes should perhaps make provisions - in case the higher authorities also declare negative interest rates in principle to be inadmissible and many millions have to be paid back to bank customers.

Jennifer Aniston has an entire beauty army
She is now officially at the top of Hollywood.
But their lives are like a roller coaster.
Jennifer Aniston (52) was chosen by the US magazine "The Hollywood Reporter" as the most influential woman of the year.
For her, who made a splash in 2021 with the "Friends" reunion and the continuation of her series "The Morning Show", this success is primarily the result of a lot of discipline and work.
A whole army of assistants, stylists and trainers take care of her appearance.
After all, so Aniston, she treats herself to a chip a day (yes, you read that right: a SINGLE chip from the bag).
That her heart is beating for both female and male fans is actually a miracle.
Perhaps because she is simply unlucky in love - and still looking for the great love.
And has crossed off the desire for a baby from the list.
Previously, she was constantly asked when she would become a mother.
It hurt her.
The people who asked that have no idea what's going on with me personally, medically, why I can't.
It was really hurtful.
It remains to be hoped that success and fame will also bring happiness.
An undignified end to a career: Räikkönen has to give up
Kimi Räikkönen's departure from Formula 1 was even quieter than expected.
Abu Dhabi - The 42-year-old Finn took off his gloves and wiped the sweat from his forehead.
That's it.
After a driving error and a slight collision with a barrier, Räikkönen had to stop his Alfa Romeo at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix after less than half the race distance.
It was his 349th and last Grand Prix, the "Iceman" ends his career in the premier class of motorsport.
For the farewell, his wife Minttu and the two children had also traveled to the United Arab Emirates.
Räikkönen's greatest success was winning the 2007 World Championship in a Ferrari.
He won 21 Grand Prix, started 18 times from pole and finished on the podium 103 times. dpa
Friedrich wins 60th World Cup victory - Nolte wins in two-man bobsleigh - Sport
The mark of the Norwegian biathlete Ole Einar Björndalen with 94 successes is the goal of the bobsleigh pilot.
"I did the math, I would need to win nine and a half races per season, then I could make it to Cortina 2026," said the double Olympic champion from the BSC Oberbärenburg, who recorded two successes in two days at the races in Winterberg.
First, on Saturday, he fended off the attack from Johannes Lochner by five hundredths of a second, moving up from third to first place.
Then he changed something in the material setting and on Sunday he increased his lead by 0.30 seconds.
With his team Thorsten Margis (SV Halle), Candy Bauer (BSC Oberbärenburg) and Alexander Schüller (SV Halle), he beat the Briton Brad Hall.
The Austrian, Benjamin Maier, came in third.
"We took a bigger risk today and were rewarded," said Friedrich, who also won his 22nd race in a row.
The Berchtesgaden Johannes Lochner, who was driving for Stuttgart, came in fifth place after previously coming in second.
Christoph Hafer from BC Bad Feilnbach landed in eighth place after finishing fourth in the first race.
"If I knew what he was doing differently, I would do it that way too," said Lochner.
Nolte with home victory - Podium for Jamanka
In the women's race, Laura Nolte won her third season victory in the two-woman bobsleigh on her home track.
After only finishing fourth the day before in the monobob, she raced to a World Cup victory on Sunday during the German triple success with pusher Deborah Levi.
Two-woman bobsleigh Olympic champion Mariama Jamanka from BRC Thuringia came in second with Germany's fastest sprinter, Alexandra Burghardt from Burghausen.
In addition to her Olympic qualification, she recorded her first podium finish this winter.
Wiesbaden's Kim Kalicki landed in third place with Leonie Fiebig.
For me it was supercool, first podium in the World Cup, I'm superhappy that Mariama is taking me along.
I'm super happy with the development.
There is still a lot of potential at the start, but the start times today were okay," said Burghardt and emphasized: "It's not just about pushing off, but there is also a lot to do around it".
Jamanka was a little annoyed about the not quite flawless rides, but said: "It's going in the right direction."
I had the duvet in my basket and could buy it now!!!
What am I supposed to do?
I haven't received it and therefore couldn't redeem it, which is why I finally asked.
Last year, I had completely different problems due to Corona and never had time for it.
And now it was said that he was out of date, which made me very angry.
Look in the chat, it was about the Asare bench.
I want to return it and then order it again as it's on sale right now :)
Why is shipping only starting on the 16th of March?
There was nothing on your website about such a long delivery time
No, only when I tap on it does an extra field with the message appear.
It was taken yesterday by your colleague.
Why is this a problem today?
I have also sent you pictures of the wrongly delivered goods.
But we would like the shelf module anyway, just a new undamaged one
And not cancel the entire order.
Only this day, only this week, only until XY...
Hello dear great girls and girls and women,
I have a lot of things I just want to write down and maybe it's the same for one or the other...
I'm 24, have cPTSD, a full-time student and a dog mom - apart from the fact that my dog doesn't scream or go to kindergarten, he's basically my child.
My boyfriend (of 6 years) is sick, got a 2nd degree burn on Monday and has been depressed for years (but is now in therapy).
I visited him yesterday because I also have emotional needs and because I want to see and feel him. We cuddled a lot and it was nice.
I helped him in the shower (because his hand is bandaged due to a burn).
He's also got a cold and we're seeing each other less (1-2x a week) at the moment, which is very difficult for me with my needs for affection and love.
My puppy has just got a stomach ache, I cooked for him and now he's lying in his snuggle blanket and has relaxed a bit after I was there with the heat lamp and stroking for him.
I live with my sister and my mother, and she's away for a month.
Now we also have housework coming our way, which we of course divide up.
But even cooking is a lot of work for me...
My PTSD is currently well-managed, I'm half-way through my therapy and I'm coping.
Not good, but I'm coping and I'm almost symptom-free.
My university is currently demanding a lot (for me), tomorrow at 3pm I have a written test for which I haven't done anything yet, and the day after tomorrow I have an anatomy class for which I should at least prepare a little bit.
And next week I have an oral exam on Tuesday, and what comes after that is in my calendar and not in my head because there is no more room there.
So my week goes like this: Only until tomorrow, then it's the weekend.
But then it goes on?
Only until the birthday.
Only until the start of the holidays.
Only until the weekend.
Only until...
And so it goes on forever.
I think I'm just so stressed that I need those mental cues, otherwise I can't do it.
Somehow I feel guilty and "chaotic," but I can't do it any other way...
Do you feel the same way?
Honestly, I'm infinitely grateful that I don't have to work.
I'm really infinitely grateful, I can't even put it into words.
I don't know if I would have survived my kptbs otherwise.
I think this also has something to do with the mental load of women, and that's why I thought I would find fellow sufferers here...
I wish you a relaxing evening anyway, the week is almost over!
I received my order today, unfortunately it is a completely different colour plus the surface is scratched and the table leg has an imprint.
The first delivery was exactly the same colour as on the website.
We are very disappointed!!!!
What can you offer me?
If we change the table now, will I get a different colour or what?
The email to cancel was sent on 26.12.#NUMBER#.
In fact, twice.
However, it was not confirmed.
Something completely different: I noticed back in school that many religion teachers don't believe in God and for them it's just another subject like maths or geography.
For me, it was always a bit strange, perhaps also because I was raised Christian and I always believed in it somehow.
How do you feel about it?
Perhaps you can also talk about work or study colleagues with different attitudes.
Basically, I understand the difference between private and professional and it makes sense to separate them.
There is also a curriculum and so on.
But I would also find it strange to have a physics teacher who does not believe in the theory of relativity.
What makes someone want to teach religion if they don't believe in it?
To preserve culture or something like that?
I hope your question is not too personal.
Can it not be changed or not? Write in English if you like, I understand that well too.
That's been a very long time, then I would refrain from it
That's good, thank you.
I expect a response soon, at the latest by the beginning of next week.
Thank you for your support #NAME#.
Film search help please
Hello everyone,
I'm looking for a movie from my childhood (I'm 24).
I think it was a film for young people.
The film has two time-lines (or parallel worlds).
On the one hand, the modern (real) world.
On the other hand, the past (or the land of the dead) (not sure).
Since I can't describe it in the real world anyway, there is a young woman.
And in the realm of the dead a young soldier (uniform similar to those of the soldiers from Pirates of the Caribbean).
For some reason, the paths cross and a plot is created.
The antagonist is also a soldier from the realm of the dead who wants to bring the woman into this realm so that he can live himself, I mean.
The transition is also the grave of the soldier, I believe.
In the end, I believe both soldiers are fighting against each other.
If that means anything to you, I'm grateful for any response.
Our little one has only slept on her front from week 1.
Fast forward: still alive :D
Relax.
A child can take a lot more than you think.
Make sure everything else is right, no cuddly toys, go in more often and have a look, but no minutes of surveillance.
That makes you crazy!
Fresh air in the room.
A good mattress.
No pillows.
Oh, and ours didn't have a sleeping bag, but always a blanket.
Observe your child when it is sleeping.
Does it turn its head to the side?
Can it lift itself up from its belly?
Or is it lying face down directly in the mattress?
You can tell from that whether everything is in order.
We have all grown up and when my husband was born, for example, it was common to put the kids on their stomachs to sleep.
In addition, we are already "regular customers" with you and have already bought a lot of items.
But why are you only offering me 20 euros?
Hello, I have already written to one of your colleagues yesterday and have not yet received a response.
It's about my wardrobe that arrived yesterday (order number: #ALPHANUMERIC-ID#).
The right drawer does not fit in the cupboard.
I ask you to contact me as soon as possible.
The cupboard is currently not usable.
To put it simply.
RBTV has made a lot of promises.
And yes, I know myself that not everything can be held.
And I also had a lot of fun with RBTV.
It's just that the politics of this station are now so bad.
Almost every format is sponsored (ok), but then to go on a big begging tour at the same time.
It was said that one was an "independent" Internet broadcaster.
Quote Arno: "We don't want to be a running billboard."
What are you now?
A 0815 advertising channel that is trying to sell its BilloMerch to the elite fan.
And then we have Marah's Do's and Don'ts.
Naturally, they apply to everyone, except for Simon and Etienne.
They are of course allowed to continue to insult people.
A Krogmann who is completely lacking in empathy and is trying to make a profit at the expense of the action with the rented rooms that have exploded.
How can you like all of this?
It's great if you like it, I find it terrible.
I am requesting a call back as my delivered wooden table was delivered defective.
Corpus break due to damaged delivery of #PRS_ORG#.
Whether as a comforter for stomach ache or just for cuddling - my little heat friend is versatile.
Cherry pit pillows are a traditional home remedy for soothing heat applications, as cherry pits can absorb and release heat in a controlled manner.
The removable inner cushion is easily warmed in the microwave or oven.
The soft material makes the application particularly pleasant, so that the little ones feel safe, even when they are not feeling well.
The cherry pit pillow with cover is suitable as a heat pad exclusively for the following areas of application:
Before warming, check for unusual odor, stock or burn marks and discard immediately if present.
Please remove the inner cushion from the cover before heating it!
Heat in the microwave at max. 300 watts for max. 2 minutes (follow the microwave manufacturer's instructions!)
Immediately after heating, distribute the heat evenly in the pillow by shaking!
Then place the inner cushion back into the cover.
During the first warm-ups, a slight moisture formation may occur on the surface, which however disappears with repeated applications.
Be sure to follow the specified heating instructions, as longer times or higher energy levels can cause damage (risk of inflammation and burns!).
Before heating a kiss in the microwave, check that heating grain products is allowed in the manufacturer's instructions.
After placing the heated inner cushion back into the cover, please check the temperature of the cushion for suitability for babies (max. 43 °C) at your elbow!
Do not use the pillow for acute and chronic, inflammatory or febrile conditions, circulatory problems, fresh hematomas, bruises and open wounds, and for people with reduced pain sensitivity.
If you have existing skin, heart, vein, diabetes or cancer conditions, or are pregnant, please consult a doctor before use.
If seams have opened and loose kernels are coming out, dispose of the product and the loose kernels immediately and out of reach of children.
If the product is used on babies under 1 year of age, the child's temperature should be checked regularly during use to prevent overheating!
All serious incidents related to the product must be reported to the manufacturer and the competent authority of the country in which the user is established.
The cover is removable and can be washed in the machine at 30 °C.
Please note the care symbols on the product!
Darmstadt second after the first leg - Pauli wins in Düsseldorf
Darmstadt 98 may dream of returning to the German football league.
Meanwhile, Hannover 96 is working its way out of the table cellar.
Ingolstadt is also not doing well under the third coach.
Jubilation in Darmstadt after the late victory in the top game, joy in Hanover over interim coach Christoph Dabrowski and frustration in Ingolstadt after the unsuccessful debut under the new coach Rüdiger Rehm.
Is the battery broken?
Last night, my laptop (ThinkPad E480 20KQ and about 3 years old) was no longer being charged by my power supply.
I bought this about 5 months ago, so it should still work.
I thought that the power supply alone was enough to operate it.
No luck, the battery is empty and the laptop won't start despite the power supply being plugged in.
I then removed the battery, but nothing happened here either.
Maybe you have ideas?
A new battery has been ordered, but why can't I use the laptop when it's plugged in?
Is something else broken?
Thank you for your help!
I want the delivery of the #PRS_ORG# to my room.
How do I book it?
I'm interested in the #PRS_ORG# chair.
But I don't know how high the seat is...
Often on tour and still taking a lot of equipment with you?
No problem with the Peak Design Everyday V2 Backpack!
Its 20-litre capacity can also swallow larger photo equipment without any problems, which can be safely stored using the padded FlexFold dividers.
And whatever else you need for everyday use remains well organised and separate from the camera equipment thanks to the practical access points in the individually configurable interior.
With the "update" of the Everyday Line to version 2 (V2), the series is presented in a new look.
The sleek, minimalist design has it all - with the Everyday Backpack series, Peak Design has developed some highly innovative solutions that reliably protect the interior of the backpack while still providing instant access to photo equipment.
This works in two ways: Firstly, conventionally, via the lid flap, which can be closed with the MagLatch closure system, a well-thought-out solution for effective protection that has already proven itself with the messenger bags.
The closure flap contains a metal closure hook with matching anchor bars on the front of the backpack.
Unlike most backpacks, Peak Design has considered different "fill levels": there are 4 anchor bars, stably riveted, into which the closure hook can be hooked.
If the rucksack is fully loaded, you simply take the top beam, if it is rather empty, a deeper one.
The flap closure and hook are also magnetic.
In this way, the backpack can also be closed reliably without engaging the hook.
The second option also fundamentally distinguishes the Everyday Backpack from other photo backpacks: In addition to the lid flap, there is also a zip opening on both sides of the backpack.
This eliminates the biggest drawback of traditional top-loading backpacks - you no longer have to rummage through the contents!
At the same time, this clever detail increases the everyday usability of the backpack enormously: If you take not only your camera equipment, but also everyday items or travel luggage with you.
In the Everyday Backpack, you can individually configure the interior (more on this below) and thus store both things separately - and access them independently through the two side openings.
You can also pull the pack from the right side to the front to access the camera gear in the right main compartment, while the everyday items stay safely in the left side of the pack and don't get in the way.
Comfortable, easy-to-adjust carrying straps help with this.
And since the outer shell of the backpack is also made entirely from 100% recycled, weatherproof nylon, the contents will stay dry even if you're heading to Scotland in the fall.
Unfortunately, I have been waiting in vain for the email from their support.
#NAME# sent me an email yesterday confirming the assignment of the
The freight forwarder has announced contact to collect the wrongly delivered table.

Hello, my order number is #NUMBER#. When will the item be delivered?
The order and payment was on 12.1.21.
I was sent a completely different lamp than I ordered
Please call me
If you extend the voucher, I will place a larger order, but at least I kept the damaged piece of furniture and didn't send it back.
And that the past year turned out differently than expected, I could not have foreseen and therefore could not redeem and clarify it in a timely manner.
But I have suffered damage as a customer and I do not accept that.
Rotinger brake discs are designed for the demands of the dynamic driver, who knows how to appreciate reliability and safety when braking even under difficult conditions.
Rotinger brake discs are made from cast iron and then mechanically worked (drilled and cut).
All tinted windows are produced in short series according to individual technical characteristics, which are specific to certain windows and patterns.
On the basis of the individual technical drawing, a special manufacturing program is created, which is adjusted to the balancing of the disc according to the characteristics of the original assembly.
The modified discs produced in this way ensure high comfort and braking effectiveness.
Additional openings created increase the effectiveness of cooling the disc, while the cuts improve the cleaning of the brake discs and brake pads.
The aesthetic properties of our custom-made windows emphasize the character of each car with their attractive and eye-catching appearance.
Coloma is the town where an unexpected event shaped the history of the West Coast.
In the winter of 1848, a man discovered glittering nuggets in the water at the southern fork of the American River.
Although he tried to keep his discovery a secret, the news spread quickly and triggered the so-called "California Gold Rush" of '49.
Thousands came from near and far, making Coloma one of the fastest-growing and most prosperous cities in the country.
Areas were staked out, tents were pitched, and saloons and hotels were almost overnight.
Everyone wanted their share of the country's wealth.
For many, it was "Coloma or Bust!"
In this game, you are a pioneer looking for wealth in the West and wanting to make a name for yourself.
You will search for gold, recruit workers, gather horses and build businesses.
You will also have the opportunity to explore the surrounding river courses and adjacent areas.
You are not alone - the other pioneers seem to have the same idea!
You have to outdo your pioneer colleagues or you'll go under with the rest of them.
Coloma is a fast-paced strategy game with many paths to victory.
You simultaneously choose your actions, must manage your resources, and build a tableau that increasingly "works" for you (so-called "Engine Building").
The buildings on your tableau allow you to become more efficient, get additional actions, or bend the rules in your favor.
With these buildings and the dynamic bridge tiles, you can develop your individual playing style with fine adjustments.
Coloma covers a period of three years from 1848 (the year gold was discovered in Coloma), through 1849 (the year of the California Gold Rush) to 1850 (the year California achieved official statehood).
A year in Coloma consists of five rounds.
During each round, players secretly and simultaneously choose a location on the game board where they can perform actions.
Then their selection is revealed and they place their Pioneers in the appropriate locations.
If a location has the most pioneers, it gets a lock!
This disables one half of the site - reducing the possible actions there.
Then players take turns performing actions such as gathering resources, moving wagons, setting up tents, scouting rivers, building bridges, opening shops, and positioning gunfighters.
When all actions are completed, the Pioneers return.
The pitchman turns to a new location at the start of each round, changing the available actions.
This continues until the announcer has moved five times, thus covering each location once, and the year ends.
There's a shootout in which players must defend Coloma from a raid by angry bandits.
If the players have contributed enough gunfighters and outnumber the bandits, they receive rewards.
But if they fail, they get smaller rewards or end up in the graveyard.
The game ends after the third shootout, and then the final score is announced.
The player with the most victory points wins!
For free shipping, I will use the shipping method, goods shipment (games shrink-wrapped), up to the dimensions of 35 x 25 x 4.5 cm.
For everything else, usually DPD, insured and with tracking (games wrapped in foil, wrapped in tiles and packing paper).
If you are a collector, I can also send the box in a box for an additional charge of 2 euros to ensure that there are absolutely no pressure marks.
"Why children are not tyrants" documentary, ARD Mediathek
CW: psychological violence, sexual abuse, abuse of power
The ARD documentary appeared in my Twitter timeline today, and I watched it right away.
>The child psychiatrist Michael Winterhoff is a regular guest on talk shows and gives lectures across Europe.
With his book "Why our children become tyrants" (2008), he sparked a heated debate on education.
Former patients and legal guardians are now making serious allegations against him.
Please take care of yourselves, the film is hard to watch.
And I am very grateful that many people now think and act differently.
It must never, never, never be about power over the child for us parents and other responsible persons.
Our goal must always be to give the child space for its development and to make the framework for the child as large as it is sensible and possible in the situation.
Brrr, it still chills me.
Holetschek: Countries discuss dropping testing requirement for triple-vaccinated
The health ministers of the states want to decide on a nationwide abolition of the testing requirement for triple-vaccinated people at their next meeting.
"We countries need clarity quickly on whether and when the testing requirement can be lifted for those who have been vaccinated three times," said Klaus Holetschek (CSU), chairman of the Conference of Health Ministers, to "Bild am Sonntag".
The removal of 2G plus for triple-vaccinated people is "not only medically sensible, but also provides an additional incentive to get vaccinated," said Holetschek.
Federal Health Minister Karl Lauterbach (SPD) has promised that "he will make a proposal to the Conference of Health Ministers on this as early as next Tuesday". - afp
So I want to send the lamp back
What is the best way to go about it?
Hi, I think the #PRS_ORG# chair is very nice, but I can't see how high the seat is.
Can you help me?
I can no longer make a purchase through my #PRS_ORG#.
Notice: Oops, an error occurred.
Shopping through the #PRS_ORG# website on a computer works.
I have updated my account details.
What could be the reason for this?
What you describe is called "awareness," or sensory perception under general anesthesia.
These occur with a frequency of about 1 in 1000.
Most commonly, it involves hearing sounds/voices, less commonly seeing images, and very rarely experiencing pain.
Relevant to this topic: Cesarean sections are operations that come with an increased rate of awareness, as a very deep anesthesia is avoided to protect the child until the umbilical cord is cut.
Previous episodes of awareness should be mentioned during the pre-anesthesia interview.
Certain types of anesthesia, such as total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA), carry a slightly increased risk.
**EDIT: Dear all, this comment of mine does describe awareness correctly, however** u/Nitemarex **had by definition none.
I misread her comment.
The chair is broken, though.
Unfortunately, the 20 euros won't help us either.
These are statutory warranty claims.
The absolute minimum would be that they take back the broken chair.
This is standard in the eCommerce sector, in addition to the legal requirement.
Please check again whether they at least take back the defective chair.
We will then sell the second chair privately.
We also lose a lot of money.
I have already sent you an email which you have not answered.
The question again.
The order and the invoice state that the goods will be delivered to a room of my choice.
The freight forwarder is company #NAME#.
I just called there.
I was told they only deliver to the front door - due to #PRS_ORG#.
Is that so?
If so, I will have to cancel the order as I do not know anyone who can carry the heavy furniture up to the first floor.
Why won't they call me?
I had asked a question
Theater historian Günther Rühle died at the age of 97
He has made a name for himself as a theater critic and as a director.
Later, he wrote a monumental history of the theater.
On Friday, Günther Rühle died at the age of 97.
The new book is still on the table, hot off the press: "An old man gets older".
The harrowing diary of a slow farewell to the world, which the theatre historian and journalist Günther Rühle kept until April 2021.
And in the middle of reading comes the news that the author has died.
The last sentence in the book reads: "I already testify my gratitude for life here."
There are different types of pallets.
One of the most common is the Euro pallet, a standardised wooden pallet that is mainly used as a load carrier in Europe.
They are certified by the European Pallet Association EPAL
According to data from Statistics Austria, over ten million pieces of pallets were produced in Austria in 2020.
The production value was around 79 million euros.
The number of pallets imported into Austria each year is not recorded
New York wins the MLS championship for the first time
New York City FC won the Major League Soccer title for the first time.
After the 1:1 in the regular playing time against the host Portland Timbers, the team from the Eastern Conference decided the final in the penalty shootout with 4:2.
In the Eastern Conference final, New York had defeated Philadelphia Union, the team of German Kai Wagner.
Rouladen tips and tricks
I got a lot of great tips here a week ago for the perfect goulash.
It was for Christmas and it was unbelievably delicious and melt-in-your-mouth!
So thank you again for that :)
Now I've got the taste for it and I want to cook roulades for the first time on New Year's Eve.
Tomorrow, I will make a beef stock for it.
Do you have any other tips for me?
Note: I don't have an oven, just a big pot.
What's next?
What about the books or how do I get them back on my #PRS_ORG#?
My English is not so good anymore, but I can manage
It is about a refund of €#NUMBER#
I was already informed by email on 18.01. that the refund had been made.
But to this day, the money has not been paid into my account.
Please check that.
Where there is still Christmas roast in the Lübeck area
For many people, goose or duck is as much a part of Christmas as the Christmas tree and the presents.
Haven't you got any poultry yet?
Now the time is tight.
We will tell you where you can still get a Christmas roast in the Lübeck area.
The "drive" of a tube power amp contributes significantly to the warmth and fatness of the guitar amplifier sound.
These characteristics are perfectly implemented by the Valve Reactor circuit.
With the VOLUME, GAIN and MASTER VOLUME controls, you can set the desired level and the amount of distortion in your sounds.
In addition, the VT+ series amplifiers feature a unique POWER LEVEL control that allows you to reduce the sound level without changing the "gain" or distortion.
It was already mentioned earlier that the POWER LEVEL controller can even be used to make a performance reserve available quickly if things get outrageously loud.
Thanks to the POWER LEVEL regulator, the full potential of the VT+ series can be used in every situation.
The headphone jack can also be used as a line-out.
The signal that is attached here is processed with a speaker simulation, so that you get an "acoustic" sound impression even when using headphones or when recording directly.
A CD or MP3 player can be connected to the AUX socket, so you can jam to your favourite songs.
A tuner function is also on board - so you don't need a separate tuner.
Anyone who also buys a VFS5 foot switch can call up the sounds conveniently with their foot, switch the effect blocks on/off and "tap" the tempo for the compatible effects.
This is actually indispensable for live use.
With its new power packs, VOX is taking another step into the future!
But I've seen it like that with others.
Is there then the possibility to return the lamp?
Because it hangs too low over a dining table?
So I would like to send them back.
Can you help me with that?
And the chest of drawers?
Will we get another update on the exact delivery date in the coming weeks?
Hello, have you ever sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs
If it doesn't work, I would also be happy with a discount or a voucher.
I might find a buyer for the furniture.
Over 1,000 euros for goods I don't need is a bit much.
I have just received my delivery and would like to know if screws were supposed to be part of the delivery.
I would like to mount the #PRS_ORG# mirror (door) on the designated hook.
That is not a satisfactory answer and the wait was not worth it
Do you have a premium customer status?
Iran sees progress in nuclear talks
According to Iranian reports, progress is being made in the negotiations on the revival of the international nuclear agreement.
"Both sides are on the verge of agreeing on the issues that are to be on the agenda," Iran's chief negotiator Ali Bagheri told the news agency Irna on Sunday.
This is a "positive and important development," because at first there was not even agreement on the topics to be negotiated.
The agreement is intended to prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons.
On Thursday, the Vienna talks to revive the agreement were continued after a nearly one-week break.
Iran, Germany, Britain, China, France and Russia are taking part in the negotiations.
A US delegation is also present in Vienna, but only indirectly involved in the negotiations.
Thuringia overtakes Saxony - Free State now federal state with highest Corona incidence
Thuringia has replaced Saxony and currently has the highest incidence rate in the country.
As the only federal state, the value is above the mark of 1000.
Thuringia was the only federal state to have an incidence rate above 1000 on Sunday.
The Robert Koch Institute gave the seven-day value with 1025 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants.
In Saxony, which has always had the highest incidence rate in the country, this value was 990.5 on Sunday.
On Friday and Saturday, the incidence in Thuringia was slightly lower, but also above the value of 1000.
In Thuringia, 2242 new infections with the Sars-CoV-2 virus and 16 further deaths in connection with an infection were reported within one day.
On Sunday, 200 people severely ill with Covid-19 were being treated in intensive care units in hospitals.
There may be delays in registration at weekends.
In addition, the health departments have been overburdened for weeks and can hardly keep up with recording new cases.
I understand that.
Since the delivery is not until early March, it may be possible by then.
I have to print it out and stick it on the package and drop it off at the post office, right?
Do I have to click/enter/fill in anything else here?
That is exactly what I want to avoid, which is why I am writing to you.
I would like to please cover the return at my own expense.
An 8 euro return fee is, in my eyes, a cheek.
It's time for change
###Greetings to the Bundestag, I am u/StratorDE in the plenary hall in the heart of Europe on a fantastic day!
#Why is the post here?
If you look at the activity of the Bundestag in the past few months, you can see one thing: it does not exist.
We've fallen into a winter slump and extended the summer lull to a few months.
#Where is the problem?
Yes, what was the reason?
For the most part, this is probably just down to the dissatisfaction with how some things have gone here and how we stand in general.
In recent days, it has become increasingly apparent that many people here are still really keen on the Bundestag.
#What we need to change
At this point, the community around the Bundestag is being asked, which wants to keep it alive.
The impetus came from u/edizVEVO, who has become aware of this project in recent days and found, simply put, a mess.
After some back and forth, several people from the community have come together who are interested in rebuilding the project.
However, I would also like to call on everyone once again to participate, only in this way can this project continue to exist in the future.
We have created a discussion platform in the form of a Discord server, where we can exchange ideas with each other and work out concrete things.
You can join the server via this link.
Goals:
* How should the Bundestag work in the future?
* Which existing orders need to be changed/amended/removed?
* How should we present ourselves to the outside world in the future?
* How will new members be recruited?
* How do we create a fair voting system?
I'm pretty sure I've forgotten some things, but that's not a problem, we have Discord for that.
If you have the time and the will, come to the Discord, work with us and let us decide democratically about the future.
I have ordered a lampshade from you, which is still to be delivered.
Now I see that the article is too big/clumsy for that and not suitable for my taste.
For this reason, I have already ordered a different suspension from you.
I put it together and then noticed it when I took the soft foam.
I'm very sad about that.
I hope that this is returned and I get a full refund.
This is also quite sad, as the #NAME# is much darker than expected.
I have another question: the day cover #PRS_ORG#, is it also available in a larger size, for example, in 240/240?
#PRS_ORG# must be able to guarantee that the faulty cupboard will be collected in a timely manner.
And I ask you to make that happen now.
I don't have suitable packaging, but I will dismantle the cupboard as much as possible for collection - they will have to clarify with #PRS_ORG# how this can work.
#PRS_ORG# can call me at any time to arrange a collection date.
Is there an assembly guide?
How long would I have to get them or decide to return them?
How do you respond to the question of why you are vegan?
Today I had a conversation with a colleague that I like.
She herself once lived as a vegetarian for a while, and now she probably eats meat very rarely.
I myself was a vegetarian for several years.
When asked if I had always wanted to be vegan and vegetarianism was a planned interim step, I answered honestly without much thought.
I thought for a long time that I was supporting animal welfare as a vegetarian, but at some point I reflected and understood that I was ultimately also supporting animal cruelty.
Therefore, my decision to become vegan.
At that moment, I had the impression that discontent was arising on her side; she then defended vegetarianism and said she knew where her meat came from and that as a vegetarian you reduce animal suffering.
Now I wonder if my answer was too "blunt"?
How does she answer the question?
I have the feeling that as a vegan you are quickly put in a corner and conflicts arise without you wanting them to.
A harmony-loving vegan says hello (;
It is not a clear-cut case of an exception under Section 312d of the German Civil Code.
Your #PRS_ORG# does not exempt you from the legal requirements for distance selling.
I am not home on the assigned date that #PRS_ORG# is picking up my return.
Since I can't be there because of a funeral, it can't be changed, unfortunately.
I would like to be assigned an alternative pick-up date, please.
From 01.02.#NUMBER#, I will be available again continuously.
Lahnsteiner Wehr equipped for water rescue: 45,000 euro grant from the state
Recently, the Rhineland-Palatinate Minister of the Interior, Roger Lewentz, presented a grant notice in the amount of 45,000 euros for the new water rescue vehicle of the Lahnstein Volunteer Fire Department to Mayor Peter Labonte in the Lahnstein Town Hall.
The total cost of the vehicle, which has been in use since November 2020, was 135,000 euros.
A good and important investment in security.
I am pleased that the state of Rhineland-Palatinate is supporting us in this," says Lahnstein's mayor Peter Labonte.
The equipment wagon is used by the Lahnstein diving squad, one of a total of seven units in Rhineland-Palatinate.
Above and below the water, they perform tasks in water and ice rescue as well as technical assistance.
In Lahnstein, one is dealing with a permanent increase in calls: The boom in hotel shipping on the Rhine and Moselle, as well as the continued increase in the use of the Lahn as a leisure river, are contributing to this.
I bought a book that I could only read 10% of and then the problems started.
I can't open the book.
I have followed their recommendations but have synced, removed and reloaded the app and NOTHING has worked.
I'm a bit frustrated because the whole thing has already cost me a lot of time and I'm now hoping for help.
Okay, that's how it is.
I would like to order 3 items from the #PRS_ORG# collection for June.
Can I enter a date in the ordering process?

Thank you first of all for standing up to the whole thing here, I have also spent almost a decade in public service in a similar capacity, i.e. we were also weapons bearers in the executive, I don't want to go into that any further!
I always find the question of right and left very simplified.
In principle, however, one should say that of course the public servant comes more from the liberal to conservative spectrum and not from the revolutionary left, that should be clear to everyone.
Of course, it should also be clear to everyone that people who wear uniforms and carry weapons should also be right of centre. It should also be clear that these people can of course have a hard time dealing with the lived reality. Of course, in addition to the average white person, there are now many Germans with a migration background, women and also homosexuals (and by that I don't mean the over-feminine stereotype of a gay man, because these people are rather rare to non-existent in the executive branch, but rather normal men and women who you wouldn't notice unless they tell you), and I can and must rely on these people, because in doubt they will save your life or put it at risk for you.
But even these fringe groups represent a conservative attitude, in my experience, even if it sounds strange at first. They are proud of Germany and feel less included by over-the-top left-wing politics, even if this politics supposedly advocates for them or thinks it is doing them a favour. They just want to be treated normally.
Back to the right-wingers, since the police and armed forces are also a cross-section of society, one will also find extreme right-wingers there, but that they are allowed to openly express their opinion there or even openly plot any state-endangering plans is completely exaggerated in the media and also annoys me.
Of course, it happens that police officers and soldiers, who have often been deployed abroad, start to generalise and say things that are controversial or politically incorrect due to negative experiences.
It also happens that right-wing like-minded people meet and engage in a lively exchange of ideas.
Nevertheless, I think that such things are well combated and also counteracted with political education and enlightenment!
Germany is so very international and I think that's a good thing that we can't afford to have real racists and Nazis in our ranks!
Yes, what I don't understand is that I also ordered the other basket on the German side.
Why should it come from England?
When I ordered, it wasn't sold out.
I ordered in November.
but it was confirmed to me in your order confirmation
It's still about my order that can no longer be delivered.
I was chatting with #NAME# before.
Alternatively, one could have the other #PRS_ORG# basket for #NUMBER# euros in black delivered to Germany or is this basket also available in Germany.
I can only ever find you as a partner company.
but at the top edge of the wooden part are two deep grooves that have been filled with something yellow
and on the mirror itself is a small scratch
Normal through a child?
Hello, I (w32) have been concerned about something for a long time.
I am very disciplined and organised at work (I am self-employed, with very little free time), but all my life I have struggled to keep my household permanently clean and tidy.
There are always phases in which everything is left lying around, and then every now and then it gets to me and I tidy up and clean.
But it's never really "just in case someone might drop by spontaneously."
My husband is (unfortunately) not better, it bothers me somewhere but most of the time the household simply loses against work and reluctance.
The kitchen is cleaned most regularly as we like to cook.
Now to my question, have you managed to become more organised with a child?
We don't have one yet, but we're working on it, and this question has been on my mind for some time.
Because for me, I have no incentive, it just doesn't bother me that much, as long as no visitors come and, for example, there is always fresh clothing and the kitchen is usable.
Do you have a greater incentive with a child or do you remain sloppy?
I look forward to your answers.
An exclusive, new, high-quality and anatomically pre-shaped cut offers maximum comfort, a perfect fit and thus almost unrestricted freedom of movement.
Pre-shaping with special, further embossing at the joints for improved freedom of movement (at arm and knee bends)
The area covered by the Flex System 2 was more than doubled for the Focea Comfort 4 to further increase comfort.
Seamless stretch panels at the joints reduce friction (armpits, arm and knee bends)
High-quality pre-shaping in the lower back area and in the crotch ensure a close-fitting, perfect fit.
Elaskin 8.8 stretch panel in the lumbar area increases flexibility around the back zipper, improving comfort, especially when bending over and when donning and doffing equipment on the surface.
The Free Flex Zone around the shoulders and back guarantees increased flexibility in the movement of the arms and back.
Fireskin is a warm, water-resistant material with a special surface structure that provides a high degree of cold protection.
When placed on the chest, it brings warmth to a sensitive area of the body.
Seamless, thin (-2 mm) face seal on the hood increases comfort, seal and durability (separate head hood)
A soft, collar-based zone improves the seal with a fine-adjustable width adjustment through a flexible, gentle hook-and-loop closure that does not stick to the lining or the seams
Double cuffs with a zip on the arm and ankle connect a fold-back inner cuff with a soft, lined neoprene outer cuff
45° indentation at the end of the inner sleeve for increased elasticity and durability when putting on.
Long zip at the back with an Elaskin reinforcement, for an anatomical cut with increased comfort on the overall without a hood
Long G-Lock P back zip (overall without hood) with metal slider and integrated Water Dam System for improved sealing (Beuchat patent)

Edges of the inner cuffs notched for increased flexibility
The original Beuchat system was designed to hold the computer in place, especially during deeper dives (the system is compatible with all common wrist-mounted computers)
A career in social work - as someone with an insecure personality disorder?
I did a training in software development and have now been qualified for about a year.
Unfortunately, I am increasingly realizing that this profession is not right for me, which is why I have been thinking for some time about starting over and studying social work.
The problem: I have an avoidant (or anxious avoidant) personality disorder (APD).
This means, roughly speaking, that I have no self-esteem and am therefore shy.
I have no problem talking to people on a professional level, but I find it very difficult to have casual conversations and I've been told more than once that I come across as unapproachable (which I think I've improved on).
Can I become a social worker this way?
I don't want to work as a street worker or in an open youth centre, but rather in, for example, addiction counselling or family support.
But I don't know if the actual day-to-day work is really like I imagine it, and it's hard to find anything about it on the internet.
The ÄVPS is already causing problems in my job (for me, emotionally), because it drags me down every time there is something to complain about in my code ("messed up the simplest things again") and it's hard for me to ask more experienced colleagues for help ("I should really know how to do this by now"/"I'm holding him back from his work with my stupid questions"/"he must really think I'm incompetent" etc.).
I'm probably going to have problems in every job, but I wanted to mention it here.
But you have already got the sofa back?
Because there was no confirmation for that either.
I'm waiting for an appointment to pick it up
What do they mean by "please return"?
When I try to download a book on the #PRS_ORG# I get the message Your #PRS_ORG# does not authorize this book
Is there a problem with that?
I was chatting with #PRS_ORG, who asked me if I had received a delivery confirmation for my wardrobe.
The protein ingested with the food is broken down by the bird in its gastrointestinal tract into the individual protein building blocks (amino acids) and from these it builds up its own body proteins, which it also needs for feather formation.
The feather formation in nestlings and the feather formation in moulting birds are extremely complex processes and are associated with a particularly high strain on the animal's overall organism.
Please note that NEKTON-Bio must not be administered during breeding, as it can cause disturbances in the hatching process.
After this course of NEKTON-Bio, it should be returned to the daily vitamin supply with NEKTON-S (multivitamin preparation) and NEKTON-MSA (mineral supplement).
The protein ingested with the food is broken down in the bird's gastrointestinal tract into the individual protein building blocks (amino acids) and from these it builds up its own body proteins, which it also needs for feather formation.
The feather formation in nestlings and the feather formation in moulting birds are extremely complex processes and are associated with a particularly high strain on the animal's entire organism.
Please note that NEKTON-Bio must not be administered during breeding, as it can otherwise lead to disturbances in the hatching process.
After this course of treatment with NEKTON-Bio, the daily vitamin supply with NEKTON-S (multivitamin preparation) and NEKTON-MSA (mineral supplement) should be resumed.
1 g NEKTON-Bio in 250 ml of water or 100 g of soft food.
It is only advisable to prepare as much drinking water/soft food as the bird consumes daily and to change the water/food daily.
A level measuring spoon (included) is equivalent to 1 g of NEKTON-Bio.
In the case of severe feather damage, the double or triple dose of NEKTON-Bio can be given at the beginning, until the start of new feather growth is visible.
After that, the normal dose is served until the feather regrowth is fully completed.
Storage: NEKTON-Bio should be stored dry, without exposure to sunlight, between 15° and 25°C.
Please excuse me, but the chair is sold as an office chair.
How can an office chair break after 9 months?
The warranty claims in Germany are 24 months.
That is really very bad service.
Hi, I sent an email on Monday to let you know that my order arrived damaged and pictures were attached.
Did you receive this email?
A statement by a community worker contradicting the ordinance
Hello r/LegaladviceGerman,
I have the following problem.
A walnut tree is to be cut down on our property.
So a felling application was submitted to the municipality.
A staff member writes to me that the felling of fruit trees and thus also the walnut is not part of the statute.
However, the walnut is explicitly listed as a tree to be protected in the by-laws.
Can I rely on the employee's statement or not?
On the one hand, I must be able to rely on an expert opinion.
On the other hand, the statute is clear.
Thanks for your answers
We understand that.
Then we will use the new packaging for it.
I have not received a message
Well, then I still have a sofa without use.
Could you offer me a discount or a voucher?
What was more expensive?
Yes, I believe so, but the question is whether I can pay in euros and have the blanket delivered to Germany.
Can you check that?
Breaking news: Serious traffic accident in Selb
Recently, a serious traffic accident occurred on the St 2179 between the Selb-Nord interchange and Plößberg.
As the current police press release states (14:03), a car came into the oncoming traffic while overtaking.
There are injuries.
Ah, okay, I understand.
Well, thank you very much for making it so easy!
Advice and ideas for further professional life
First of all, Merry Christmas to you!
Unfortunately, my Christmas is not very good, because my dear head is currently destroying everything that can be thought about.
Before I go on now ... in short: I need advice and preferably from people who know my situation in some way - so from you.
I'm currently doing the refereeing as a change of career.
I originally studied something else and worked in a different field (to remain at least a little anonymous, I won't say anything more specific here).
But then it was all too boring for me and I looked for alternatives that could be more fun for me.
At some point, I ended up in teaching and I was sure that this is it - even though the framework conditions are much less flexible than in my previous job, but I didn't care.
I'm now at the third "I'm googling other job listings" stage.
And it's only been half a year.
With the paintings before, I always decided to keep going and at least finish the ref, after that I can always change course.
But right now I'm absolutely done.
I've had so little free time over the past month that I'm completely exhausted.
Now it's holiday time, but there's still a lot of work waiting for me.
Before the referee, I always thought I was stress-resistant, but there my weekend was also my weekend and my evening off was my evening off.
I was free.
And the stress at work was irrelevant in those moments.
Now, even family celebrations are too much stress for me.
And then there are these rigid structures that get on my nerves even more.
Basically, it's fun and from the outside, the refereeing is going well, in terms of feedback and so on.
But I'm completely exhausted and wonder how much stress my body can take before it completely shuts down - if it isn't already.
I wonder if I want to have it like this for the rest of my working life - especially when I read some of your posts here - or if I should go back to the old field, where I was appreciated, could take time off when I needed it, and although I found the work somewhat boring, I was paid appropriately and worked together in a team instead of being a lone fighter as it is mostly the case now.
But then I wonder if in a year's time I won't be back in the same place as I am now and unhappy.
You can see that everything is a bit of a mess, but maybe you, as outsiders, have advice or ideas on how I can get out of this situation, where I am completely finished and start to cry at the slightest thought of it.
I'm not going to make decisions right now based on emotion, that probably won't lead to anything good.
But perhaps your views will help me to see a little light at the end of the tunnel - or to enjoy Christmas, which is enough for me for now.
Thanks for reading and sorry for the whiny undertone.
I hope that my situation is at least a little clearer now.
Since its introduction in 2001, the VOX Valvetronix series has continued to evolve, including the combination of advanced modeling technology with the "Valve Reactor" circuit, which perfectly emulates the behavior of a tube amplifier.
With the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X amps, we are introducing a brand new modeling engine that is absolutely state-of-the-art in terms of sound.
Thanks to the VET (Virtual Element Technology) technology, which is based on the analysis of the components and the amp circuits, the VTX amplifiers boast an authenticity that is absolutely impressive.
These amps also contain the multi-stage Valvetronix tube preamp.
This is partly based on real analog circuits, because these get the sound variations and nuances of a tube amplifier simply better than any simulation.
In addition to this sophisticated circuitry, the VTX amplifiers feature a closed enclosure and a bass-reflex system that bubbles with natural resonances.
With the VOX "Tone Room" software, you can even correct and bend historical facts on the virtual level until the amp and effects sound just the way you've always imagined them.
The perfect combination of tube sound with modeling technology is primarily due to the VOX Valve Reactor technology introduced in 2001.
Of course, it has been refined several times since then to meet new sound requirements, which in 2010 again led to a performance boost for the VOX Valvetronix series - with more dynamics and numerous and significantly improved amplifier models.
From the handy VT20+ to the VT120+ with two speakers, the new VT+ Valvetronix series has been designed so that all guitarists looking for maximum sound variety will find what they are looking for.
All guitarists dream of the pressure and dynamics of a tube amplifier: they expect a fat sound, a nuanced reproduction of playing dynamics and string attack, and a quick response.
During an in-depth analysis, the VOX engineers discovered that it is the power stage in particular that determines the tube character of an amplifier and developed the VOX Valve Reactor technology based on this finding.
The Valve Reactor circuit of each VT+ amplifier, which is equipped with a 12AX7 tube, perfectly reproduces the behavior, the subtle nuances and the sound character of a tube amplifier.
NBA: Despite 20 points from Wagner: Magic lose to Clippers
The Orlando Magic's losing streak in the NBA continues.
The Wagner brothers can shine - but it is not enough to win against the Los Angeles Clippers.
Despite 20 points from Franz Wagner and seven points from his older brother Moritz, the Magic lost 104-106 to the Los Angeles Clippers on Saturday.
The large main compartment is also adaptable: with three individually placed and foldable Velcro dividers, it is completely tailored to the needs of your photo equipment and is therefore suitable for all types of cameras - from mirrorless system cameras of all sizes to full-frame DSLR cameras.
What ultimately fits in the backpack depends on the size of the camera and the lenses.
A possible loadout would be a DSLR camera with a mounted lens, two to three interchangeable lenses, and a mounted flash.
Larger DSLM cameras like the various models of the Sony a7 series or a Fuji X-T2 still leave room for more lenses.
In addition, you can store a lot of accessories.
And if you have a small DSLM camera (Olympus MFT cameras, Fujifilm X-A or E-series) you can use the backpack for your equipment and for non-photographic things.
Drone pilots also make an optimal choice with the Everyday Backpack 20L, as the backpack offers enough space for a DJI Mavic Pro including remote control and accessories.
Volcanic eruption on La Palma: probably the longest in history
In the just under three months since the outbreak began, the lava flows on the Canary Island have caused great damage.
Is an end in sight?
With a duration of now 85 days, the volcanic eruption on La Palma has been the longest in the known history of the Spanish Canary Island since Sunday.
So far, the eruption of the Tehuya volcano in 1585 with 84 days was considered the longest on the Atlantic island off the west coast of Africa.
There are no reliable data on previous eruptions.
The activity of the as-yet-unnamed volcano in Cumbre Vieja has decreased somewhat in recent days, but volcanologists still did not dare to predict when it could end.
The indicators point to a slowdown.
The best news is that they are stable," said the president of the island council, Mariano Hernández Zapata, to the state TV channel RTVE.
Millions of euros worth of damage
In the just under three months since the outbreak began, the more than 1000-degree hot lava has destroyed almost 2900 homes and other buildings, as reported by RTVE.
Just under 1,200 hectares were covered by a meter-thick layer of lava.
That is almost 1700 football fields.
More than 7,000 residents had to be evacuated, and the damage is estimated at more than 900 million euros.
Two new land masses were created off the coast by cooled lava, with a combined size of about 50 hectares.
The banana cultivation, which is immensely important for the island and from which about half of the approximately 85,000 inhabitants live directly or indirectly, was particularly hard hit. It was already in crisis before the volcanic eruption.
225 hectares of banana plantations were destroyed, and other areas were heavily affected, wrote the newspaper "El País".
Christmas and the gifts
Christmas is just around the corner and especially the children will hardly be able to wait for the heavenly feast.
The many colourful gifts under the Christmas tree, combined with the spiritual atmosphere and the crackling tension, have something seductive about them.
Christmas is one of the few traditional occasions that still hold our increasingly divided society together.
It is all the more important to be aware of the Christmas tradition of giving, so that the gesture of giving, which, according to the French sociologist and ethnologist Marcel Mauss, was a peace-promoting "social contract of primitive peoples," can escape the rigid routine and be given new life in the context of this tradition.
How Saint Nicholas became the Christ Child
Strictly speaking, it was the Protestants who linked the Christmas days with the giving of gifts.
Previously, on St. Nicholas Day, gifts were exchanged in one way or another.
The background to this still popular custom is that Saint Nicholas, as Bishop of Myra, had thrown gold into the windows of three women in one night to save them from a life of sin.
This unconventional way of giving led to the popular German tradition of filling children's boots with gifts.
Protestants objected to this practice because they reject the idea of mediators between God and people as "idolatry."
For these reasons, they are opposed to the institution.
Martin Luther turned St. Nicholas into the Christ Child and thus founded a new tradition.
The focus of gift-giving thus shifted to Christmas Eve.
Since most Protestants no longer see such detailed questions in such a narrow way, it only annoys a few that the custom of St. Nicholas is still a fixed part of the pre-Christmas season, just like the custom of St. Martin with St. Martin's singing and St. Martin's parade.
Today, one can find everything from socks to coveted luxury watches at the front door and under the Christmas tree.
Diversity of traditions in Christian countries
Sources indicate a tradition of gift-giving on Saint Nicholas Day since the 13th century.
With the Reformation, the day of giving shifted to Christmas Eve.
However, in all Christian countries there is a cheerful confusion over the question of who brings the gifts to the children.
In Germany, it depends on the region whether the Christ Child appears on Christmas Eve or Santa Claus, who is essentially a kind of Saint Nicholas, to whom some peculiarities have been assigned over time.
These include his white beard, which has little in common with the more stern Assyrian beard of the historical figure, his sleigh pulled by reindeer, and his preference for the chimney to gain access to the houses.
In the Netherlands, Saint Nicholas remains the central figure on Christmas Day.
In Spain, the Three Wise Men give the gifts, while in Italy it is the witch Befana who is said to have shown them the way to the baby Jesus.
In Scandinavia, sometimes mythical creatures bring the gifts, while in Russia it was Father Frost that brought some fame.
Here it is not reindeer, but three horses that pull his sleigh as a troika.
In the Czech Republic, the birthplace of the Reformation in the course of the Hussite Wars, the Christ Child is responsible for the delivery of gifts.

Police shoot suspected bank robber near the King's Palace
An armed man was shot dead by police on Saturday near Kensington Palace in London.
Police said callers reported a man entering a bank and a bookmaker's shop with a weapon.
The man fled in a vehicle, which was stopped by officers a short time later, according to authorities.
Shots were fired and the man was hit.
He was pronounced dead at the scene.
The police did not assume a terrorist background.
Several embassies are located in the area around Kensington Palace.
The palace is the official London residence of Prince William, his wife Catherine and their three children.
Other members of the royal family also live there.
which ones?

The decorative light harmoniously fits into every bed, garden area or rock garden.
The light is simply set up and can be anchored in the ground with 2 ground spikes.
Integrated and powerful 0.4 watt solar module for optimal charging of the built-in battery.
Illumination time max. 10 hours.
- The robust plastic finish is suitable for year-round outdoor use.
In the Hollywood spectacle, it is usually threatening objects from distant galaxies that glow brightly within.
On the other hand, "Smart Stone" is completely harmless: The sun alone ensures that this solar light shines fascinatingly - optionally in white or coloured light (in six different colour tones).
The edge-free, amorphous design is deliberately chosen: Like a naturally formed large pebble, this modern lighting object presents itself during the day.
Its organic curves fit into any natural environment - whether on the edge of the terrace, in the lawn or in the rock garden.
It also does well in the company of larger pebbles and boulders, where it can hold its own thanks to its size.
You can save yourself a lot of preliminary work: As a solar light, "Smart Stone" does not need a power supply or batteries.
Place the "beacon" in any sunny place.
Two included ground stakes provide a firm hold when needed.
The matt white plastic shell itself is robust and weatherproof.
Its solar panel discreetly hides "Smart Stone" inside, along with its battery and two LEDs - one for white, the other for colored light.
The battery is already charging when sunlight falls on the housing.
As the twilight sets in, "Smart Stone" starts to light up on its own; in which colour, that's up to you: You have six attractive light colours to choose from, in addition to daylight white.
The switch-off also occurs automatically once the battery charge level has fallen to a pre-set minimum or it gets light again.
Once the sun shines again, the charging cycle starts all over again the next day.
I have done this several times, but it doesn't work.
It's a shame, I would have liked to continue ordering from you, but if the voucher is not credited to me, then I will not order from you in principle.
If you change your mind, let me know.
Otherwise, that was the last contact today.

The motor control of the LokSound 5 has been fundamentally improved once again.
A variable PWM frequency from 10kHz to 50kHz ensures super-quiet operation, especially with bell-shaped motors - the typical "humming" is a thing of the past.
The load regulation can now be adapted to difficult cases with up to 10 CVs.
The unique "Autotune" function allows the decoder to automatically adjust to the motor.
The LokSound 5 decoder delivers up to 1.5A of motor current, enough juice even for older motors.

The pill problem
Hello dear ladies,
I hope I'm doing everything right here, it's actually my first post after a year on reddit.
My problem: I was forced to start taking the pill again about five years ago, mainly because I had such incredibly bad pain during my period and terrible PMS before my period.
Now I would like to keep it that way, because I already have to take enough medication for chronic illnesses that I cannot choose.
My main problem, surprisingly not the pain, but my skin.
I had gone from 0 to 100 with an explosion of spots during my last two-year break and they were everywhere.
So far, so superficial, but it really weighed on me and I didn't feel comfortable.
In the two-year break, things have never really normalised.
Maybe someone has some tips to avoid this time.
My cosmetics are already fragrance-free and without any fuss, but maybe there's something that someone can recommend to me.
Unfortunately, the gynecologist didn't take me seriously, and the dermatologist appointment is yet to come.
Many thanks to everyone who has read the novel!
Yes, skin is a thing.
Had severe atopic dermatitis as a pre-teen, then a period of calm, then widespread nodular lichen and the acne issue.
I have also tried all sorts of things in terms of nutrition due to my chronic illness, and I have stuck with a diet low in sugar, milk and meat, because nothing else really worked well.
It could also be that hormonally, it's just the worm in there, but if you're like me and you have a construction site everywhere, you don't want to look for anything else that's going wrong.
I had already done everything for her colleague semina or the like.
Written and now I've lost the conversation and don't know what was replied to my request.
I always have to work in between and answer the phone, and suddenly everything was gone...
What is there to check, if the money was there, I would have seen it
Please check my bank details, maybe there was something wrong
but does it exist at all in large
as it is widely available in black

In the name of the people: Lay people pass judgement
In the courtroom, they sit in everyday clothes on the judge's bench.
But their verdict is important, even if they don't wear a robe: Jurors, together with professional judges, determine whether and for how long someone goes to prison.
Two of them report in conversation with the "Oeffentlichen" from their time at the Bad Kreuznach regional court: Sascha Wickert from Boos and Ruth Ertz from Bad Kreuznach are two of a total of 125 lay judges at the regional court on John F. Kennedy Street.
Hello, unfortunately I can't get into my customer account.
Could you please send me the invoice for order number #NUMBER# again to the above-mentioned email address?
Can we dispose of the packaging material?
We have no means of keeping them for so long.
We would use the table as they offered it, as if it were ours.
Yes, I had already ordered the same chair in blue in November and received it. I would therefore like to have one in grey because they are so beautiful.
Does the wardrobe have to be completely dismantled for collection and return?
and when would the pick-up be?
The 110 kV underground cable will be rebuilt in 2022
The approval for the relocation of the new high-voltage cable in Tann is legally binding.
The planning approval decision of the government of Lower Bavaria clears the way for construction, which is due to begin in 2022.
The network operator Bayernwerk announced this.
The approximately seven-kilometre-long underground cable will connect the Tann switching station in the north of the municipality and the existing 110-kilovolt line between Simbach and Pfarrkirchen.
The cable will be connected to a pylon of the overhead line near the village of Edermanning near Reut.
Good morning,
My order from 03.01.21 with the order number #NUMBER# has only arrived in part.
The blue Betsell number #PRS_ORG# with the tracking number #NUMBER# was returned by #PRS_ORG# with the note "Delivery not possible".
The other three packages have arrived, so delivery is definitely possible.
Can you tell me what the next steps are?
Have a great start to the week!
You can forget that, I've already explained that several times yesterday!!
This is a glass dresser and all the sides have burst open, so there is glass everywhere and the box is broken
The chest of drawers is in my apartment and #PRS_ORG# refuses to come into the apartment because of the #PRS_ORG# regulations
This means the chest of drawers cannot be collected as no one is allowed into my flat
Thank you for the message
but why only 20 euros?
The original value of this chair was #NUMBER# EUR
No, it's with all books, that's why I asked #PRS_ORG#, as it seems to be a general problem
Ref: Planning lessons (EK)
Hello dear colleagues,
I have been in the Ref since the summer. I enjoy teaching, but I currently have major problems planning my geography lessons in a time-efficient manner.
Unfortunately, my school is not technically well equipped at all, so in principle I can only use the blackboard, the school book and an OHP as a medium.
In school, I can only copy s/w for free (which is annoying for geography).
I'm currently just taking a very long time to plan my hours.
For example, we are currently dealing with the topic of geofactors, and in my case, each hour is essentially on its own.
In principle, the methods are always repeated, but on the other hand, I don't want to invest too much time in simple lessons (which I also need for UBs, etc.).
When planning, I always start with the learning objective (what do I want to achieve) and then think about how I can build on that (I usually create a worksheet with texts from books that my school does not have).
We have the book Terra and with most of the tasks in the book I am rather dissatisfied.
Therefore also the worksheets.
Perhaps a geography teacher can tell me how to work efficiently with the book.
I would be really happy.
I would like to return the #PRS_ORG# from order #NUMBER#.
I have actually already decided on a new one at #PRS_ORG#, but I would like to process the return as quickly as possible.
The trade is worried about the Christmas business due to the 2G regulation.
Only those who are vaccinated or have recovered are allowed into most shops.
The trade considers this unnecessary and laments sales losses.
He also has a possible solution ready.
According to the German Association of the Retail Trade (HDE), the 2G regulations are ruining the important Christmas business for the retail trade.
With businesses dealing with non-daily necessities, there are complaints of a drop in sales, criticized Stefan Genth, CEO of the HDE.
According to a recent survey by the HDE among 1100 retailers, more than 70 percent of the companies had a negative outlook for the rest of the year.
Many had already written off the Christmas business.
"What should actually be the positive highlight of the year is now often a bottomless pit," said Genth.
Dealers with 2G access restrictions lost around a third of their pre-crisis sales in the past week.
Only the food retail sector and the online sector are doing well.
The association demanded consequences from the dramatic development.
Shopping with a mask, distance and hygiene concept is a safe matter, said the chief executive.
"2G when shopping does not help us in the fight against the pandemic," he stressed.
The current regulations deterred customers and required a lot of staff.
He called for the nationwide approval of the ribbon system.
After that, each customer would only have to be checked once for 2G (vaccinated or recovered) and would have access to all shops with the wristband they received on that day.
In addition, in retail - as already in public transport with the 3G rule (vaccinated, recovered or tested) - random checks should be sufficient.
The property group Deutsche Euroshop, which specialises in shopping centres, also spoke of a difficult Christmas business.
The frequencies were last at around 75 percent of the pre-Corona level without 2G, and the turnover at around 90 percent.
These figures will now certainly fall in the midst of the all-important Christmas business," said CEO Wilhelm Wellner to "Wirtschaftswoche".
Due to the high personnel and administrative effort, solutions are being sought and approved for the centers.
This includes the so-called wristband solution, where "visitors, for example, provide their 2G proof at a central location in the center once and then - equipped with a wristband similar to that in a club hotel - can enter all the shops without being disturbed". dpa
I recently ordered and received the #PRS_ORG#.
The mirror has a scratch and the frame also has a defect, which was tried to be covered up with a yellow filler.
That looks ugly.
I would like to return the mirror and have already packed it back into the package and sealed it.
How do I proceed with the return now?
The lamp is designed for Dual-Balance, based on new, flat, high-power, high-CRI SMD LEDs.
A modern microprocessor with exceptional capabilities is responsible for setting the colour temperature and brightness of the lamp.
In addition to adjusting the brightness, there are two standard color temperatures: daylight and artificial light.
It is also possible to manually set and save the color temperature in the range of 3100 - 5650K.
Use the current settings in the Flash memory.
A special feature of the controller is that it is easy and intuitive to use.
The lamp produces a very high light output with soft, high-quality light, completely flicker-free.
The 120 degree beam angle, which allows you to light up large areas at a relatively short distance, is excellent.
In fact, also in reporter situations in small rooms or at short distances.
They can adjust the brightness practically without changing the color temperature.
It's a great tool to work with both on set and in the studio.
The optional DMX512 controller allows the light to be controlled remotely in television studios or when the light is mounted in hard-to-reach places.
The control panel is on the back of the light, consisting of buttons and a backlit display.
The display shows the current brightness setting in percent and the current color temperature in Kelvin.
There is also a slot for the NP-F batteries (not included)
User memory The memory has up to three panel settings for brightness and color temperature.
To set the individual settings on the memory slots, simply press and hold one of the memory buttons and you're done.
The memory controller stores the current state of the lamp when it is turned off, so that when it is turned on again, the known situation is restored - very practical for studio work when, for example, the camera is set to specific colour temperatures.
Working with a battery one of the biggest strengths of the DL3120 functionality comes from the ability to operate with inexpensive NP-F batteries.
These are often already owned by photographers and cameramen (and women) - so you can make use of existing equipment.
The DL3120 can also check if the batteries have enough power before you set it up - it has a built-in battery tester - for each of the two battery compartments a value in the two display screens (the left battery on the upper display, the right on the lower display).
In addition, it is of course possible to continuously power the headlight via the included power supply.
The construction of the headlight is very simple.
They have a 16mm sleeve for attachment, so you can attach them directly to your photo tripod.
The inclination can be set reliably using the locks on both sides.
It was noted that the mechanical components are also of extremely high quality and are therefore designed for longevity and hard use.
In addition, a tilt joint is included in the scope of delivery.
It's great that a bag is also included in the scope of delivery.
This way, you can transport or store the light fixture with all the accessories you may still want to buy without any problems.
Shame, I got it as a gift and it's too small :(
"The party we wanted to throw": Frankfurt celebrates after a goal-rich comeback against Leverkusen
What a spectacular reaction from Eintracht Frankfurt.
After 22 minutes, the last two times in a row, the Hesse were apparently on their way to the next Bundesliga defeat.
But then the SGE turned things around, shot the frustration over a mediocre start to the season out of their system within a good hour and won with a furious 5:2. "It's crazy what the boys have done today," jubilated coach Oliver Glasner on DAZN and spoke a "blanket praise, to each and every one of them who was there".
At first, it looked like another setback for the now ninth-placed Frankfurt, which is still behind its expectations.
Patrik Schick had put the Leverkusener in the lead with 2:0.
What then happened also impressed the SGE coach.
"How the players then came back and showed a fantastic performance," continued Glasner.
I'm insanely happy with the performance we've shown and of course with the result.
Even defender Christopher Lenz, who was able to stand on the pitch for the first time since the fourth matchday and his overcome muscle injury, emphasized the morale of his teammates.
"I think our mentality is incredible," said the 27-year-old, and with a look at the result, he was especially happy for the spectators.
That was the party we wanted to throw today.
For the upcoming tasks, Glasner wants to keep the focus on himself, but he also sees himself well-positioned in terms of the personnel situation.
It's unusual that we have all the players fit in December, that all the players are in top physical condition.
It's top-class work in our medical department, but the players also live a very professional life.
Now, one wants to "move forward step by step and remain modest" and carry out the tasks until the end of the year "at this level".
Next up is an away game at Borussia Mönchengladbach on Wednesday as part of the English week (6.30 p.m., Sky).
I just received the email that my package is being returned to you due to an error on my part.
I've tried calling #PRS_ORG# and asking them to redirect, no chance.
Can it be sent directly to me again or do I have to wait until the money is refunded and place the order again?
Unfortunately, this would mean that I would not order again because it has already taken a very long time.
Have you ever sat in a #PRS_ORG# chair?
A damper for the handball women before the quarter-final against Spain
Germany's handball women slunk off the court after the humiliation against Denmark with heads hung low and vacant stares.
To conclude the main round of the World Championships, the DHB selection suffered a heavy defeat with a score of 16:32 (8:13) in front of 800 spectators in Granollers and must now face the host Spain in the quarter-finals.
"We were much too scared and had too much respect for the opponent," said national coach Henk Groener.
We have to play differently against Spain.
After the first defeat in the tournament, Germany finished second in the main round group III with 8:2 points behind the Danish women (10:0).
It's a shame that we couldn't take the flow with us.
That was a bad game for all of us that we have to get rid of," said captain Emily Bölk.
In the fight for a place in the semi-finals, a clear improvement is needed against the 2019 World Cup runner-up next Tuesday to keep the delicate dream of the first medal since 2007 alive.
The best German thrower in the duel with the three-time Olympic champion Denmark was backcourt player Alina Grijseels with six goals.
"We just weren't there - neither in attack, nor in defence," admitted backcourt player Xenia Smits and called for: "Now we have to look forward quickly."
Not up to it from start to finish
Unlike in the previous five tournament games, the German team was not up to the mark at the start.
Missed shots and technical errors in the attack and gaps in the defense were responsible for a quick 0:4 deficit after seven minutes.
Only goalkeeper Dinah Eckerle was immediately on her game and prevented worse with some saves.
The first goal was scored by the DHB team after 9:30 minutes, when Grijseels successfully completed a fast counterattack.
The hoped-for initial spark was not this, however.
Against the aggressive defence of the Danes, the German women could hardly make an impression - and when they did, they mostly failed against the strong Althea Reinhardt in goal for the Scandinavians.
So the game was over early at 3:10 after 20 minutes, especially since backcourt player Mia Zschocke was also shown red for a hard foul on her opponent.
In the quarter-finals, however, she is allowed to participate again.
Only in the final phase of the first half did the DHB selection play a little better and at least come within five goals of the break.
The already faint hope of a comeback after the change was already gone after seven minutes at 9:19.
Again, the Groener players sinned in all areas and made it easy for the well-prepared opponent, who is one of the medal candidates in the final round.
As a result, the German team could not muster a performance boost and left the court as clear losers.

How does it work for them?
The title is given in advance, I work as a vaccination doctor in mobile vaccination teams, in which (so far only) the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine is mainly administered in nursing homes.
Since these are soon to be largely completed, I will continue to go to vaccination centres.
I am happy to answer questions without time limit on the organisational and human aspects and also medical questions, as long as they are not personal (e.g. "I take medication X, is it compatible with the vaccination...").
My area of responsibility includes providing information about the vaccination, the indication (the person is entitled to a vaccination according to the Corona vaccination regulation and has no reasons that speak against it), the medical documentation and, if necessary, emergency care in the event of allergic reactions (this has never happened to me).
The vaccination itself can be delegated to qualified personnel, e.g. medical assistants.
In vaccination teams, we often don't have them, but "only" (for God's sake, no lack of appreciation!) pharmaceutical-technical assistants for vaccine preparation, who, however, cannot (are not allowed to?) carry out vaccinations, so that I carry out most of the vaccinations myself there.
Serious "Huidlerer" question: Amberger knows the solution
What on earth is a "Huidlerer"?
With this dialect word, sent in by an Amberger, the BR television programme "Wir in Bayern" has caused a lot of thought.
But unlike on many of the previous days, the term in the "Host mi?" series remained a mystery to the callers.
No, it was not a "man who is nervous."
And also not one "who wants everything to happen quickly".
What the people heard from the TV presenter was completely wrong.
To which the man from Amberg gave the solution, and thus probably also caused astonishment among many people from the Upper Palatinate.
"The Huidlerer," the viewers learned, "is a rag with which someone wipes the oven."
Dialect researcher Antony Rowley, who has been questioned as an expert by Bayerisches Fernsehen for years, confirmed this.
With the note that this is a typical Upper Palatinate term, derived somehow from the more well-known dialect word "Houdern".
With which an educational gap was closed - probably also for many who have been living in the Amberg area for a long time.
I haven't been able to buy books for two weeks.
After confirmation, the following error message always appears: oops - something went wrong - try again later.
I have restarted the #PRS_ORG#, connected it to the PC, synchronized and repaired it.
Nothing helped.
Tyre choice for a racing bike - really so puncture-proof?
This morning I woke up full of energy, because I wanted to do at least a little bit of training in preparation for my bike tour next week.
Said and done, and I set off on my racing bike, which I bought on eBay yesterday.
The first 40km were also really nice - but then something happened that lurks in every city centre (this time: thanks Krefeld!).
Glass splinters on the track.
Zack, loud hissing and my rear tyre absolutely did not want to take part in the rest of the journey.
Since I had no real chance to get a replacement jacket and replacement tube due to the weekday, I had to turn back with a somewhat bad mood and take the first train home.
It wasn't so bad in terms of mood, maybe it's even better if I practice changing the tire again before the bike tour.
Now I am faced with a question and hope that you can help me.
Since I have a relatively long distance over several days ahead of me, I would not like to have this problem more often.
Now it wasn't really bad, because the old tyres from the previous owner (a very nice old man, who on the day I came to pick up the bike had ridden 120km until 2pm!) and who had also described them as suboptimal, because he had ridden on rollers for several years with them.
But when I think about the fact that I have to change a tyre after driving 80-90km, then I'm really in a bad mood, I think :D
Now I have come into conversation with an older man at the platform, who asked me in surprise why I didn't have the Marathon Plus tyres; these are supposed to be puncture-proof.
Now, of course, the whole thing sounds very tempting.
But are they really indestructible?
I have little desire to spend 40€/tyre now, only to be disappointed.
I also ask myself: I currently have 25x622 on my racing bike.
They do exist (apparently?) in the Marathon Plus tyres, but the majority are already wider.
Is this a problem?
Or would you generally recommend different tyres for a racing bike?
The Schwalbe page seems to recommend the Durano DD more to my absolute layman's knowledge?
Thanks in advance for the help and best wishes!
Car crashes into tree: driver fatally injured
The 53-year-old had crashed his car into a central reservation for unknown reasons on the B57 between Rheinberg and Xanten and then ended up in the opposite lane, as the police reported.
There was a head-on collision with the vehicle of a 27-year-old.
The 53-year-old's car was then thrown into a tree and the man was trapped in the car.
The 27-year-old and his 23-year-old passenger were seriously injured in the accident and taken to nearby hospitals.

After the release of our new high-end wideband speaker B 100-6 OHM, it was only a matter of time before our SOLO series would get a new addition.
The new offspring is called SOLO 15 and looks like the big role models with the B 200 - 6 OHM.
However, this construction proposal includes a suitably designed foot that is included to raise the speaker to the correct listening position.
This has no influence on the acoustics and can therefore be adjusted in length according to the circumstances at home.
The SOLO 15 is very well suited for people for whom the maximum volume plays a rather subordinate role, but who want to achieve an exceptionally high level of sound quality.
A 10 cm speaker is simply not capable of producing such high sound pressure levels almost unfiltered.
However, this does not mean that the SOLO 15 sounds weak.
On the contrary, she performs remarkably maturely and for her size, is extremely impressive and accurate.
The SOLO 15 was tuned tonally with a slight high-frequency rise.
This is common for widebanders to optimize the increasingly strong bundling at high frequencies.
The SOLO 15 is exactly aimed at the listening position and impresses with a very clear and fine sound.
Slightly turned outwards, the treble range can be reduced and the sound image made warmer.
Thanks to the point sound source, the location of the individual components of a piece of music in the optimal stereo triangle is razor-sharp and surprisingly precise.
The reference-worthy extremely low mechanical losses of the B 100 - 6 OHM result in a dynamics that is hard to beat.
The SOLO 15 not only complements our SOLO series, but also expands it in terms of resolution and accuracy.
As with all our kits, it is a good idea to think about the final look of the speaker at the start, so that any changes to the build can be planned for.
If you want to veneer the case, for example, the lowering of the speaker must be adjusted accordingly, since the veneer adds material.
After all the plates have been cut (e.g. at the hardware store), one should first drill an 8 mm hole in the floor plate at the appropriate place, so that the cable can later be passed through without any problems.
With the help of a router, the speaker opening in the front is now made, so that the B 100 - 6 OHM can later be installed flush.
The back should be chamfered at 45° to make the opening area of the speaker chassis inside as large as possible.
The four connection points of the B 100 - 6 OHM are interrupted in phase, as shown in the "Detail Phase" image.
After that, you start with the actual construction of the box and place one of the two side walls on a flat surface in front of you.
The back, the lid, the front and the bottom are now glued onto this.
The three stiffeners should also be used and glued in place.
The stiffeners themselves can vary in material thickness as needed, if you want to use ready-made strips from the hardware store, for example, instead of making them yourself from 16 mm MDF.
In the next step, the second page is attached.
Then follow all the plates of the foot, i.e. the two sides and the front.
A suitable hole saw or Forstner bit makes it easier to attach the openings for the bass reflex tube, as well as the connection terminal on the back panel.
Afterwards, a round-over bit is used to round off all the edges of the actual box.
The top of the footplate can also be rounded off with it.
Afterwards, the base plate is firmly glued to the foot of the housing and additionally screwed on with long wood screws.
The next step is to mark and pre-drill (2.5 mm drill bit) the mounting holes for the speaker chassis and the terminal block.
After cleaning the case of wood dust (vacuuming/blowing out), one starts with the laying of the cable.
The easiest way to do this is through the 35 mm bass reflex opening in the back.
To do this, you push the entire, uncut cable through the 8 mm hole in the foot, piece by piece, until it reaches the terminal opening, and let it protrude there by about 30 cm.
In the upper part of the case, one leads the cable to the speaker opening and lets it hang loosely there as well.
The frequency changer is then prepared and put into operation.
The construction plan for the frequency switch, as well as the corresponding connection plan, can be found in the following document: Assembly instructions for the Solo 15 switch.
Once the frequency switch is installed and the connection terminal is screwed in, the sealing of the 8 mm cable opening inside the box follows, which is not yet completely closed.
With the 35mm bASSREFLEX opening and some skill, you can drop hot glue onto the opening and seal it.
By opening the B 100 - 6 OHM and using a small lamp, the seal can be checked accordingly.
Now follows the eradication, according to the description.
Afterwards, the B 100 - 6 OHM is connected and fastened with the corresponding screws.
Polarity plays an important role here, so that the positive lead (marked cable) must be soldered to the positive pole of the speaker (larger contact).
Finally, the bass reflex tube is cut to the specified length of 28 mm (total length of the tube) and inserted.
To combat this, a mat of the damping material is cut into two pieces and loosely distributed in the case.
The opening around the bass reflex channel should be kept clear.
Can I place an order now and have it delivered in early June?
> Hello everyone,
> Finally, we can announce that we will also hold the OSCAST this year!
> Unfortunately, for known reasons, we are not able to get more than four people into the studio, which means a higher planning effort and explains the short notice of the announcement.
BUT: There will be at least three people on the call, so we'll be watching the 2021 Oscars with at least 7 beans on stream and hopefully thousands of you!
> We do our best to avoid delays or other problems.
But hey, it's still a pandemic - we'll do our best to make the Oscars as entertaining as possible.
> It will start at around 0:30.
Get some drinks cold, plan some good food, and get ready for a long, but very interesting night.
