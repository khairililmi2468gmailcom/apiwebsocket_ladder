The goods cost less than 20 euros.
The fee is equivalent to 40% of the value of the goods.
I'm a #PRS_ORG# big customer so it's not a problem for me.
I only need a number or instructions on what I should put in the package so that it can be tracked by you as a return.
I ordered the #PRS_ORG# a few days ago... for 249€.
Today, it costs 179€.
I find that very annoying, to be honest.
Do I have to cancel the order and re-order for the better price or is there another way to get a credit?
I also think in general that children should not be expected to take on the role of parents for their younger siblings.
However, I find that it is also good for older siblings to take care of the little ones in moderation.
A quick look, a quick help, bring the bottle, etc.
In this way, they learn responsibility, help in the family and are involved.
As long as they can still be children themselves, I don't see a problem.
If your K1 is occupied for a short time and it's OK for him, that's good.
You are the best judge of whether this is suitable for your children.
It's not like he's supposed to wrap K2 and accompany him for hours while he falls asleep.
Legally, it's probably questionable.
Perhaps that is why the psychologist made the statement.
Because if something were to actually happen like a fire, break-in, earthquake, alien invasion, etc. it would actually be too much responsibility for K1 to take care of K2.
Whether that is a risk you want to take is of course up to you ;)
Please help me find the title of a book!
I remember reading a crime/thriller a few years ago and I can still remember almost the entire plot, but I can't remember the title. Maybe someone here knows...
The story was about fear and how to deal with it.
At the beginning of the story, a zookeeper commits suicide by covering himself in food and walking into the enclosure with his big cats.
The case is taken over by a policewoman who, after a short investigation, turns to his therapist, who runs a clinic where he treats patients with anxiety.
The commissioner has a little niece who also has a fear (of fire) and ends up with this therapist.
There are more suicides and there is another protagonist - a photographer who is commissioned anonymously before each suicide to go to the scene of the suicide and document it and post the photos on the internet.
In any case, it turns out that this therapist is running some kind of underground therapy group where the patients are implanted with a chip that suppresses an anxiety center in the brain, and the patients ultimately have to face their fears in the most extreme way.
(A woman jumps out of a window, another drives herself to death on purpose)
This facing of fear is called "the fight" in the book.
In the end, there is a big showdown in the clinic that had to do with a fire.
That is the rough plot, I am pretty sure that the book was originally written by a French author/writer.
If anyone knows of this action or can even tell me the title of the book, I would be very happy.
Oh dear, I don't have the password for the Wi-Fi.
I have to contact my husband first.
But that can take a while.
What steps do I need to take after that?
Is it also possible to get the price difference back?
4-year-old child, splinter under the thumbnail
Kind, four years old, has wood splinters over the entire length under the thumbnail (outside).
I tried to pull it out with tweezers.
Very hard to grasp.
It didn't work and it hurt.
Now the child reacts hysterically when we try.
No chance.
Tomorrow I'm going to the doctor.

The LokSound 5 is the most important member of the LokSound family.
By combining the digital decoder and sound module on a printed circuit board, we achieve dimensions of only 30mm x15.5mm and can thus be installed in almost every H0 and 0 gauge locomotive.
LokSound 5 decoders are offered with all common interfaces and always come with an 11x15mm "sugar cube" loudspeaker and a sound capsule kit.
Like all family members, the LokSound5 is a true multi-protocol decoder.
It supports the DCC data format as well as Motorola®, Selectrix® and M4.
In the DCC format, 14 to 128 speed steps are as natural as 2- and 4-digit addresses and up to 32 functions.
Thanks to RailComPlus®, the decoders automatically connect to a suitable digital central unit.
It supports all DCC programming modes and, thanks to RailCom®, the CV values can be read on the main track with suitable central units.
For Central Units that can only program CVs 1-255, there are auxiliary registers.
Motorola® users benefit from up to 28 steps at 255 addresses.
Three additional Motorola addresses allow the triggering of 16 functions.
A built-in programming mode also makes it possible to reprogram the venerable Control Unit 6021.
The M4 protocol allows automatic registration with mfx®-compatible central units.
The LokSound 5 decoder recognises the Märklin® braking track as well as ZIMO® HLU braking commands or the Lenz® ABC system.
Braking with DCC brake blocks or with direct current is also possible.
In addition, it also stops at a Selectrix® brake diode.
An ABC pendulum train automatic allows the automatic pendulum between two stations.
The LokSound 5 decoder can be used on analogue DC and AC tracks.

Because of Omicron: Johnson wants to push for booster shots
New Omicron cases are causing concern for politicians and scientists in the UK.
Therefore, all eligible adults in England are to receive a vaccination offer by New Year's Day.
London - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to speed up the Corona booster vaccinations in the face of rapidly rising Omicron numbers.
Every adult in England should have the chance to receive a booster dose by the end of the year, if at least three months have passed since their second vaccination, Johnson said in a pre-recorded video message to his fellow citizens on Sunday evening.
So far, the target date was the end of January.
The UK Government will provide additional support to speed up the vaccination programmes in the devolved nations of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
We are facing an emergency in the face of the Omicron variant, which is why it is urgently necessary to strengthen the vaccination protection, said Johnson.
The good news is that the level of protection can be increased again with a third vaccination.
"Get boosted now!" Johnson said.
A further 1,239 Omicron cases were recorded in the UK on Sunday, taking the total to 3,137.
Compared to the previous day, this was an increase of a whopping 65 percent. dpa
will the full amount be refunded from the purchase price when collected?
I'm in favour of everyone introducing themselves with pronouns
I sent out an application.
Today, the invitation to a conversation came by e-mail.
I want to respond to the email.
But unfortunately, the name is not "Peter", but a somewhat more complicated name.
I googled it and depending on the cultural background it's either a man or a woman.
**I have no idea how to write the email now.
Can someone please help me?
** I'm a foreigner and I don't want to step on an official's toes.
Conclusion: Everyone should introduce themselves with pronouns.
I have a total of 5 books on it.
4 of them go.
Only the one I bought today doesn't work
Clearly the chair had a hidden defect at the time of sale.
How can such a cushion damage occur otherwise after 9 months?
Only on #PRS_ORG#.
This has been working for about
Not more than 14 days.
So I have always bought the latest books from the website and then read them on the #PRS_ORG#.
I bought 6 #PRS_ORG# but wanted to buy 8.
But there were none.
Now they are available again and I would like you to please add 2 chairs to my order and charge me for them.
[CW] The feeling when I can't help.
Content warning: I'm going to write about domestic violence in some detail here.
I just need to write something from my heart.
I (21) come into contact with the victims (and perpetrators) of domestic violence more often for professional reasons.
A theme that really gnaws at me and unfortunately is all too common is that many victims don't allow themselves to be helped or think we can't help them.
I am well aware that we cannot do everything and that it is not perfect.
But there are fewer things in my profession that move me more than when I can't do anything in such situations.
I see the bruises, the blood, the desperate eyes...
But even in a conversation behind closed doors, with the perpetrator far out of sight and hearing, I can't reach everyone.
I don't know what the reason is, maybe it's fear, fear of revenge, fear of leaving the familiar social environment, fear of taking the children away from it.
What I always want to make clear to everyone, sometimes even very close to tears, is that everyone deserves to be able to live without violence.
I want all women to know that they don't have to just accept violence.
I often wish I could help in any way... I know I can't.
However, it will never get easier.
Please, always remember that you are worth living without violence, that is so incredibly important.
"Arcane" on Netflix: What is the series about "League of Legends"?
A lot of fantasy, a lot of complicated names, a breathtaking presentation: "Arcane", the series from the "League of Legends" computer game universe, recently started on Netflix.
Why are we looking forward to the already announced two seasons?
Basketball Bundesliga: Derby debacle for the MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg against the Merlins Crailsheim
At least on youngster Johannes Patrick, you could rely.
Nothing again: For the second time within less than three months, the Giants lost in Crailsheim - and how!
Before the game, Ludwigsburg's coach John Patrick had said, looking back on the cup defeat at the beginning of October at the Hakro Merlins Crailsheim: "We still have some anger in our stomachs".
After the game, however, it did not calm down - but increased again in view of the 61:72 (28:38) defeat in the basketball Bundesliga.
More than the bare result, though, it was the manner of the performance that was so disappointing.
As an example, a statistic is mentioned that expresses the entire dilemma: The three-point ratio was just 13 percent, 4 hits (all by the young Johannes Patrick) in 31 attempts - any questions?
John Patrick provided the answer: "After the win in Tenerife, we just weren't focused enough and didn't implement what we had trained for".
Namely, to move the ball.
His counterpart Sebastian Gleim reacted very differently: "It was a great game to win against Ludwigsburg for the second time," said the happy coach.
"It felt like 10,000 people were there."
On Saturday, only 750 visitors were allowed in the Hohenlohe Arena, but they got their money's worth.
Not least because of BBL top scorer T.J. Shorts, who scored 22 points and led his team.
"The best playmaker I've ever trained," Gleim praised.
While in Patrick's team, the top performers like Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7) failed across the board.
Only in the last quarter (22:15) did the Giants prevent a total disaster and came within eight points, after they had already been 39:59 behind.
In addition to Johannes Patrick, Justin Simon scored 12 points.
Fortunately, there isn't much time to argue.
Already on Wednesday (7pm) the Giants will receive the Skyliners Frankfurt, before then also in Ludwigsburg a maximum of 750 spectators.
We used to have a different email address, but I changed it.
Yes, I signed up a few months ago.
Unfortunately, all warranty claims were denied.
We have sought legal advice and have therefore written to them again.
We originally signed up half a year ago.
Always as if from the egg: Max Raabe turns 59
He is able to captivate his audience with new interpretations of songs from the 1920s and 1930s.
Currently, he is on the road with the programme "Good morning, dear luck" - if he is allowed to perform.
Actually, Max Raabe wanted to celebrate his birthday on the stage in Leipzig this Sunday.
But nothing comes of it.
The planned concert has been moved to May 2022 - "by order of the authorities" to contain the Corona virus.
Other of his planned appearances in the Advent season will also have to be cancelled, as it says on the website of the singer, who turns 59 today, and his musicians (www.palast-orchester.de).
From January, the artists want to make up for the dates already postponed due to the pandemic in 2020.
Born on 12 December 1962 in Lünen, North Rhine-Westphalia, Max Raabe has been singing a lot and with pleasure since his youth.
In Berlin he studied opera singing, in 1986 he founded the Palast Orchester together with fellow students.
Since then, the baritone has established himself with his repertoire of schlager and chansons in the style of the Comedian Harmonists.
He has won many awards.
His live album from the "MTV Unplugged" series (2019) reached - just like his successful album "Für Frauen ist das kein Problem" (2013) - second place in the charts.
He has made it from the niche to the mainstream.
Always elegantly dressed, with his blonde hair slicked back and with an eye for etiquette, Max Raabe is now an integral part of the current German-speaking music scene.
Since 2020, he has been on tour with the programme "Guten Tag, liebes Glück". dpa
Hello #NAME#, is it also possible to get a small sample of the furniture wood in advance?
It can be added to existing furniture and so we can check beforehand whether it matches the colour
It still doesn't work, I can only long for the cover, but I can't turn the pages.
Federal Minister of Construction Klara Geywitz: Expropriation does not create new housing
The new Federal Minister for Construction, Klara Geywitz (SPD), has spoken out against the expropriation of large housing companies, as demanded in a referendum in Berlin.
"Expropriation does not create a single new apartment; it only changes the ownership structure," said Geywitz in an interview with the "Tagesspiegel" (Sunday).
My aim is to give tenants security that their rent will remain affordable in the years ahead.
A colourful mix of private landlords, co-operatives or housing associations is, by the way, the best protection against the formation of a monopoly.
In Berlin, the coalition of SPD, Greens and Left Party will set up an expert commission to deal with the result of the referendum.
However, if the situation does not improve, Geywitz did not rule out talks with the FDP in the Ampel coalition about further tightening of the rental law.
The coalition agreement provides for a rent cap until 2029, a limitation of rent increases in tight housing markets and the expansion of the rent cap.
I will talk to the Justice Minister to implement it as soon as possible.
If the rental market does not ease, "we will talk to our coalition partners about further steps", stressed the SPD politician.
Hello, I wanted to order something and after a few days I noticed that I forgot the last step in payment.
Unfortunately, the product is no longer available.
Do they know when it will be back in stock?
Or whether it will ever come back at all?

Thank you for the quick clarification!
If the lamp is sent in March, how long does the shipment itself take?
I've already cut myself on the finger
That is absolute cheek
At least 100 killed by tornadoes in Kentucky
A devastating storm system has swept across the United States, spawning numerous tornadoes.
Kentucky alone could have more than 100 fatalities.
The pictures from there remind one of a war zone.
In the night before Saturday, several tornadoes in the USA caused severe damage and possibly up to a hundred deaths.
The storms left a path of destruction about 200 miles long, mainly in the state of Kentucky.
Its governor, Andy Beshear, said after visiting the disaster area that everything was gone where the tornado had ripped through.
Houses, shops, government buildings - just gone.
Parts of industrial plants, roofs are in the trees.
It's hard to imagine that it's even possible.
He is expecting up to 100 deaths in the state of Kentucky alone, and the official figures are rising by the hour.
Hi, I just saw that display #NAME# is sold out.
That is very unfortunate.
Is it still being produced?
Or has it been completely removed from the range?
Is it possible to order this showcase in another country?
When will you report?
If the delivery can't be made to my apartment, I have to cancel the order!
I understand that, but can I order the ceiling now and have it delivered to Germany, which is in the shopping cart?
I had returned an article or requested a return via the contact form and wanted to ask if it had arrived or was being processed, as I had not yet received confirmation.
Firms pay vaccine incentives, change slogans
While the federal government continues to reject proposals for a vaccination bonus, companies in Austria have taken the initiative themselves and are offering their employees money bonuses for vaccination.
In doing so, they are in line with the social partners ÖGB and the Chamber of Commerce, who called for financial incentives for vaccination today.
The transformation of advertising slogans into vaccination calls - following the German model - is also intended to increase the willingness to be vaccinated against Corona.
He has moved to a company he has gossiped about.
That doesn't make his situation any better than yours.
Wait and drink tea.
It's been a year.
He obviously hasn't tied himself to his old job either and has been looking for something else.
You can do that too.
And that he didn't like you back then: well, who cares.
He didn't like his job anyway.
There are too many variables.
Please record the cancellation.
That will then be legally relevant.
I take a screenshot.

Help with first own campaign
Cheers to Boron!
I'm currently running the adventure Over the Griffon's Saddle for a group of 4 friends, and I'd like to seamlessly introduce my heroes into a campaign written specifically for the players.
We're playing DSA 5.
The big arc is done, the villains and their motivations written, the individual acts thought out, and now I'm in the process of writing the introductory adventure and already stumbling over my own feet in the first encounter.
The premise is that the heroes are to take a wagonload of grain from Gratenfels to a small village near Lake Thuran.
That is where the further action is supposed to develop.
A few miles from the village, the heroes are ambushed by a group of goblins and lured into an ambush.
I want to give the player characters the opportunity to resolve the confrontation in different ways: Persuade, act, threaten, recognize danger early, whatever the players can think of.
Group size: 8 common goblins, 2 with spears, 6 armed with bows and sabres
If not noticed, the goblins lay in wait for the heroes in a hollow way and flank the wagon with three bows each to the left and right, while two with spears stop the wagon.
Should it come to a fight and the heroes fall, I have two solutions
1. The heroes are all knocked unconscious and then found and healed by the village schoolmaster's son, a half-elf.
The cart is, of course, gone.
2. Should defeat be inevitable, this half-elf steps in with two of his servants and comes to the hero's aid in battle.
The cart is still there, everything is great.
How appropriate do you find Deus ex Machina of solution 2?
Is the encounter too much of an introduction to the adventure?
The group of Goblins will play a crucial role later on, so they are not just cannon fodder.
EDIT: wow, I didn't expect so many answers, especially not so many great suggestions and tips.
I'm sure I'll take a lot of your ideas on board and I've got more confidence in my narratives now.
I took the lamp apart again.
And again, they've been put together.
Unfortunately, it still doesn't work.
That's why I would like to send them back anyway
Can you then send the return tickets, then I can pack the lamp and bring it to #PRS_ORG#.

Here the lower part, i.e. the part with storage space, was damaged.
Will everything be collected again or just the storage space?
I'm fed up with Sky Sports F1
Hello dear F1 fans, over the course of the season, the quality on German Sky has decreased more and more, so I want to get some air with this post.
First of all, today in the middle of the F2 race the broadcast was interrupted to start the F1 pre-coverage on time.
Although the schedule was far behind the plan due to the delayed start and the start accident, the last (planned) ten minutes and the championship decision (!) could still have been shown.
It seems, however, that for legal reasons, F1 has priority and everything else must be restricted, so Sky DE had no choice here.
Nevertheless, it was stupid, since Sky UK broadcast the end of the race.
Nevertheless, a little praise: the commentator Olivier Zwartyes has accompanied the difficult situation surrounding the serious accident well.
Then there was again rule ignorance among the commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, so both did not know that you can change the tires under a red flag.
Although this situation has already occurred in Imola, Baku and Silverstone this year, both came to the conclusion that Verstappen was allowed to change tyres only when there were corresponding radio messages on this subject to Hamilton.
At Sky UK and RTL, both commentators knew immediately that Verstappen had this opportunity.
I think that such elementary rules should simply be known if you comment on the F1 on a pay-TV channel.
It's also not the first time that guesswork is now allowed or required by the rules, both of which just have constant uncertainty about the rules.
In general, I don't like the artificial style of commentary of Roos, but I admit that it's a matter of taste.
But seriously, even Heiko Wasser from RTL is better.
Add to that the constant silliness, which makes both of them look simply unprofessional, like ordering coffee from the (equally clueless) reporter Peter Hardenacke or "UuuuuHD" from Ralf Schumacher.
The latter in particular brings a lot of unrest to the comment, which he apparently does not take seriously.
Not least, the advertising is just getting out of hand at Sky, in the run-out round, Sky is the only channel that goes into the advertising, as you can hear on F1TV, where only the German sound track without commentary has to do directly after the race.
Neither ServusTV nor ORF are doing this.
These two channels also make less advertising in the trainings than Sky, and that as free-TV channels.
Although one must praise Glock and Baumgartner for their work, this alone does not make me overlook the disadvantages.
The rest of the Sky Sports F1 schedule is also very thin and full of repeats.
Overall, Sky is really the worst German-speaking channel that broadcasts F1.
Unironically, RTL is doing a better job with the four races they are still allowed to broadcast.
So, at least, the grand F1 season is a lot less fun than it would be with a reasonable broadcaster.
I'd like to hear your opinion.
Here: #PRS_ORG# pendant light, brass and multi-coloured glass x 1
Hi, I have an item that was supposed to be delivered last week and it still hasn't been delivered.
I have contacted the chat twice and so far nothing.
The first lady told me it was going to be sent on Monday, the second lady told me yesterday that she was going to check and send an email and she never responded.
Hello, I ordered two #PRS_ORG# on 12/12/19.
One of them has already shown a defect after a relatively short time (the fabric has a hole in the front part of the chair).
I ask for your support.
Air pumps are ideal for providing additional oxygen to an aquarium.
It is also possible to operate a filter system via an air lift.
This series is offered by us in 3 variants.
Look at the table at the end of the offer.
There you can see the services in comparison.
If the pumps are strong enough, one can operate entire plants with them.
If you have a large aquarium, pumps with 2 or more outlets are suitable, so that you can connect multiple outlets.
The MK series has one, two or four outlets, depending on the model. A fan pump is also suitable for setting an accent in the aquarium, e.g. with an air curtain (find it in our shop) or with a decoration, which turns the air bubbles into a function.
Here a treasure chest, shell or similar would be mentioned.
The MK series has a special, sound-insulated construction and thus ensures low operating noise.
The installation is very easy.
The fan pump is connected to a drain or similar using a 4/6 mm air hose...and then it can get started.
The fan pump should be the same, or higher than the water level and mounted on the outside.
If the fan pump is lower than the water level, a check valve should be installed between them.
Simply cut the air hose and insert the valve in between.
This would prevent the water from running backwards if the water from the pool ran through the pump...
If the fan pump is to be mounted outside, it should be covered and protected from moisture, like other air pumps
The MK series pumps are pure power packages that use little energy
Even though we specify a processing time of 3 days here on eBay, we pack daily and the packages are also collected daily here.
If everything is going well on the way, it goes very fast.
We just want to prevent a little bit, so that no one is upset, just because it took a little longer once.
It would be like this, not everyone has understanding for all the employees who also work in the shipping industry...of course, Corona does not stop here.
Please don't rate badly just because the delivery is delayed, this is entirely due to the parcel services.
Of course people like to complain about these services, even though we're saying at the moment...they've got it really tough
This is also very different from region to region.
Don't be mean to anyone, stay healthy and we all hope that better times will come again.
How long does it take to order the yellow ones with and without armrests?
Can you also order the legs in light here?
Amazon founder Bezos sends astronaut daughter and TV host into space
The daughter of the first American in space, a TV host and four other passengers have taken a short trip into space.
They were transported on Saturday by the New Shepard rocket system of the company Blue Origin founded by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.
The start and landing of the approximately ten-minute flight took place in the west of the US state of Texas.
Under a bright blue sky, Bezos personally welcomed the newly minted astronauts upon their return.
"Welcome back," said Bezos, dressed in a blue space suit, as he opened the hatch to the capsule.
To the applause of friends, family members and Blue Origin employees, the six passengers climbed out one by one and embraced the Amazon founder.
According to Blue Origin, they were in flight for ten minutes and 13 seconds, reaching an altitude of 107 kilometers.
The 74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of Alan Shepard (1923-1998), who flew into space as a NASA astronaut in 1961, after whom the Blue Origin rocket system is named, and the 50-year-old TV presenter Michael Strahan were guests of honor of the company, the other four passengers had paid for their tickets: space engineer Dylan Taylor, investor Evan Dick, technology entrepreneur Lane Bess and his son Cameron.
Blue Origin did not disclose how much each paid for their ticket.
After the short flight, Laura Shepard Churchley recalled her father's mission.
He had to work hard and do everything himself.
She was just along for the ride, said the 74-year-old with a laugh.
Michael Strahan also expressed his enthusiasm.
The moderator said that he would like to return to space as soon as possible.
"New Shepard" flies up to 100 kilometers
The New Shepard rocket system flies largely autonomously.
The capsule, which was separated from the rocket during the flight, reached an altitude of about 100 kilometers above the earth, temporarily in a state of weightlessness, before the reusable object was slowed down by large parachutes and landed again.
The International Air Transport Association and many other experts consider 100 kilometers above the earth to be the boundary to space, but there is no binding international regulation.
It was already the third manned all-day trip of Blue Origin: In the first in July, Amazon founder Bezos himself was on board, together with his brother Mark, an 82-year-old former US pilot and an 18-year-old Dutchman.
The second one in October was attended by the 90-year-old Canadian actor William Shatner, who became world famous with his role as "Captain Kirk" in "Star Trek", as well as the former NASA engineer Chris Boshuizen, the entrepreneur Glen de Vries and the deputy head of Blue Origin, Audrey Powers.
Critics have accused Bezos and Blue Origin of pushing the business of space tourism forward largely without scientific research interests for the benefit of humanity and without regard for the climate.
With the touch of a button, you can easily choose whether your "Smart Stone" should permanently glow in one colour or play through its entire colour spectrum.
When the colour is changed, the light stone retains a light colour for about a minute, before it gently changes to the next decorative colour.
The solid construction of the "Smart Stone" light makes it suitable for outdoor use all year round.
In snowy surroundings, her light is even particularly good - only with shortened light duration is to be expected, as soon as the days get shorter.
In winter, please make sure that no snow affects the solar module in its function.
"Smart Stone" uses a NiMh battery in the common mignon (AA) format, which can be easily replaced if necessary.
You can get a suitable replacement battery from our web shop and thus extend the life of your decorative light even further.

Someone who works in biochemistry or has studied biochemistry
I am currently studying biochemistry in the first semester and I actually find the subject itself quite interesting and I don't mind standing in the lab (I have already completed the inorganic chemistry practical).
Of course, I had already informed myself about career prospects before I started my studies, but I also thought at the time that I would definitely like to study until I get my doctorate.
But right now, I'm having doubts, especially about my career prospects.
On the one hand (Studycheck etc) one always hears about great career opportunities and that the profession is totally in demand, on the other hand one always hears about unemployed biologists and incredibly poorly paid jobs.
Therefore, I would really like to know:
1) What are you working on at the moment?
2) Are you satisfied with your work/salary?
3) What did you study/what training did you do?
4) Would you do it all again?
Thanks for your answers!
I'm really unsure at the moment and I'm thinking about maybe breaking off my studies in 2022 and doing an apprenticeship as a specialist computer scientist.
If you have any experiences in this area, please feel free to share them as well :)
Extra stress before holidays and holiday weekends
This came up for me last week.
But now I had to use my long weekend to relax from it.
That is why only now a post is being added.
Not only before big holidays, like Christmas holidays, there is great stress in our business.
It seems that there are also holidays plus bridge days.
It was like this: Last week was the Assumption of Mary, which we in Switzerland call "Ascension".
On Friday, the vast majority of people and businesses will make a bridge day, which is therefore semi-official.
Last week, therefore, a long 4-day weekend was in the offing.
So what happened last week?
Stress everywhere.
Lots of e-mails that had to be sent out before the long weekend, order here, order there, everything *absolutely* before the long weekend.
Because... yes, because?
Because "next week then" sounds like so much time and it can't be?
Or because people really want to do as much in a shortened week as in a normal one?
Not only was I stressed on Wednesday, but I was also very annoyed.
What is this self-righteousness about holidays?
Why do we have holidays if we are not allowed to enjoy them properly?!
The stress was not coming from above, the colleagues were all very independent.
My question is simply: are we the only ones, the Swiss?
Is this our reformed-evangelical way?
Or do you know it in the north as well?
Yvonne Catterfeld is looking forward to Christmas in Thuringia
Yvonne Catterfeld (42) is looking forward to Christmas in her home state of Thuringia - but she hasn't got any presents yet.
"The beautiful thing is, even if there is no snow in Erfurt, you can just drive to Ilmenau in the Thuringian Forest," said the actress and singer for Hit Radio FFH.
She will get into the spirit of the festival by baking cookies and making things with her son.
"I love it," Catterfeld said.
But until the contemplative days, she still has a lot to do: "For the first time, I don't have any gifts yet, I have to get started now".
NEKTON-Bio supports a smooth moult and feather regrowth.
NEKTON-Bio contains all the essential vitamins, amino acids, minerals, trace elements and 200,000 µg of biotin/kg.
NEKTON-Bio gives the bird a smooth and shiny plumage.
The majority of feather damage in bird husbandry is due to nutritional errors alone.
Since the plumage consists of a protein-rich substance, a particularly rich and balanced protein diet of the bird is necessary for the formation of a flawless feather coat.
For a functioning metabolism, the daily food must contain sufficient vitamins, minerals and trace elements.
A large part of the animal losses that occur during the moult are due to insufficient or unbalanced protein intake and/or insufficient supply of vitamins and minerals.
When composing NEKTON-Bio, the unfavourable ratio of amino acids in most plant-based feeds is explicitly taken into account and balanced.
During the application of NEKTON-Bio, no other vitamin preparation should be administered.
NEKTON-Bio is water-soluble in cold water and can be given simply via the drinking water or via the soft food.
Thanks, I found it
Unfortunately, it still doesn't work
GDR handcraft model of old building E-Lok E 95 03 DRG/ DR, the locomotive was in use in Silesia and Central Germany, the very rare locomotive probably comes from the conversion proposal of the model railway ME issue 11/1968, used with play marks and missing parts see photos, function good, The E 95 series is a heavy freight train electric locomotive of the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft (DRG), which was designed for the traction of heavy coal trains in the Silesian network, possibly the kit also comes from the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN.
A locomotive is in the DB Museum in Halle (Saale) and is operational
The Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft had commissioned AEG in 1924 to submit proposals for an electric locomotive that should be able to haul 2,200-ton coal trains and 530-ton passenger trains at a speed of 45 km/h on this line.
A maximum speed of 65 km/h was required.
Thus, in March 1926, the DRG determined the delivery as a 1'Co+Co1' locomotive with Tatzlager drive by AEG for the mechanical part, and the Siemens-Schuckertwerke for the electrical part.
From December 1927 to June 1928, six locomotives were delivered, which received the operating numbers E 95 01–06.
All of them survived the Second World War and found themselves on the territory of the future GDR afterwards.
In 1946, the locomotives arrived in the Soviet Union as reparations.
They returned to Germany until November 1952.
In the Reichsbahn repair shop in Dessau, it was determined that all six locomotives were suitable for refurbishment.
[4] As the re-electrification of the central German network progressed, there was an increasing need for locomotives for heavy freight service. In 1959, the three locomotives E 95 01 to E 95 03 were overhauled, with the remaining machines serving as spare parts donors.
The E 04, E 44 and E 94, which were available in larger numbers, were built first.
Only when it was clear that the number of compensations could not be increased any further for the E 94, did the E 95 come into the focus of the compensation.
[4] First, the locomotives were stationed at the Leipzig-Wahren railway depot.
They came to the Halle P depot in 1960.
They were mostly used in their own circulation plan before coal trains from the Geiseltal in the direction of Halle, Leipzig and Erfurt.
With increasing age, the complicated controls of the locomotives proved to be problematic.
It was often the case that shooters got stuck during switching operations.
Then the co-driver, who was constantly travelling on this locomotive, had to use a hammer and a wooden wedge to loosen the guard during the journey.
Damage to the traction motors was common and led to months of downtime for the locomotive.
[5] Since there were enough new locomotives available at the end of the 1960s and a significant expansion of electric operation was not planned at that time, the Reichsbahn was able to do without old locomotives and most of the splinter groups, so that the E 95 was taken out of service.
In addition, the Deutsche Reichsbahn only wanted to staff electric locomotives with one person, which would have resulted in a problem in train operation due to the difficulties with the machines and the visibility from the driver's cab.
[5] After the E 95 02 and E 95 03 were taken out of service in mid-1969, the E 95 01 was the last to leave service on 5 October 1970.
The proposed new designation 255 001 was thus never used.
All locomotives, except the E 95 02, have been dismantled.
The E 95 02 was set up as a switch heating system at the main station in Halle as a replacement for the future museum locomotive E 77 10.
It took some time before the officials at the Reichsbahn could be convinced that the E 95 was worth preserving as a museum locomotive.
In 1979, the external restoration of the locomotive began with the aim of being able to present it at a vehicle show in the Dessau RAW.
[5] Since then, it has been part of the Dresden Transport Museum as a non-operational museum locomotive.
In 1986, the locomotive was completed internally.
The locomotive is cared for in the DB Museum in Halle (Saale).
Since 1995, employees of the traditional community Bw Halle P have been working on the operational restoration of the locomotive.
In April 2015, the locomotive could be presented for the first time at an exhibition in the museum workshop in Arnstadt with new internal and external paintwork, where the transformers were checked and five drive motors are operational.
-The locomotives were used on the Silesian Mountain Railway and the branch lines until 1945, where they proved themselves due to their reliable drive and low maintenance requirements.
In February 1945, the machines were relocated to Leipzig to the central German network.
Its main area of operation was initially Silesia
H0 model in original packaging, function good, optical rework on the locomotive is necessary, dusty, with signs of play, cellar smell!!!, very rare handmade model, very small edition - the kit may also come from the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN
The packaging may have labels and storage marks.
Yes, the F-parts are it
I received a bed from you.
However, there were problems with one part.
The middle beam is held up by two feet. Unfortunately, these are too narrow and the beam cannot be mounted on the feet.
What do we do now?
I can't build the bed.
The middle beam is held up by two feet, which are unfortunately produced incorrectly.
The middle beam does not fit into the intended holder.
So I get new ones sent to me.
When will they be sent off?
No, no flats.
These are, according to the assembly instructions, the right ones in terms of shape, they were just too narrow
But that doesn't matter.
As long as they fulfil their purpose
They are not flat with me
Could I get this sent to me?
Hello #NAME#, shall I explain the problem to you again?
Residential fire with two minor injuries and high damage
Two people were slightly injured in a fire in a residential building in Upper Bavaria.
In addition, there was an estimated damage in the six-digit euro range, as the police reported on Sunday.
The fire had apparently spread from a carport to the adjacent house in Kinsau (Landsberg am Lech district).
Two residents were taken to hospital with minor smoke inhalation on Sunday, according to reports.
The exact cause of the fire was initially unknown, but the police did not suspect arson.
The Fürstenfeldbruck Criminal Investigation Department has taken over the further investigations.
But it will arrive much later
And I have to pay shipping again
To debunk fake news - Biontech CEO publishes vaccination photo
Uğur Şahin posted a photo of his first vaccination in early 2021 on the social network "LinkedIn"
Biontech CEO Uğur Şahin had not previously spoken publicly about his vaccination status.
Now the entrepreneur has published a photo showing his corona vaccination.
A friend's illness had prompted him to do so, Şahin said.
The CEO and co-founder of the Mainz-based company Biontech, Uğur Şahin, has published a photo showing him receiving a vaccination against the coronavirus.
There was misinformation on social media that I was allegedly not vaccinated.
In fact, my wife and I have received three doses of the Biontech-Pfizer vaccine," wrote Şahin on Friday in a post on the network "LinkedIn".
"For months, friends have been urging me to post a photo of me getting the vaccine to counter these false rumors."
So far, he has refused, because the communication should not be about him.
But a call last week changed his mind: "I was deeply saddened to learn that an old school friend of mine is currently fighting for his life.
He is fighting a severe case of Covid-19 and has been on a ventilator for three weeks.
The school friend and his family were not vaccinated, Şahin continued.
He did not ask why.
"The most common cause, however, seems to be fear, often fanned by misinformation and mistrust."
Fear is difficult to combat with facts, sometimes it is better to share personal experiences.
An interview with Deutsche Welle is circulating on the Internet, in which Uğur Şahin says he is not vaccinated.
However, the video was created in December 2020, as Deutsche Welle itself clarified.
"I am not currently legally allowed to get the vaccine myself," said Şahin at the time.
There is a prioritisation of the vaccination of the vaccine in Germany.
In the meantime, the prioritisation has long been lifted - and according to his own statements, the Biontech boss has been vaccinated three times.
Fire in substation: tens of thousands of people without electricity
On Friday evening, the lights went out in several municipalities in North Rhine-Westphalia: no more electricity and, in many cases, no heating either.
A fire had put a substation out of action.
After a fire with severe damage to a substation, tens of thousands of people in the Rhein-Sieg district of North Rhine-Westphalia had to do without electricity for around 24 hours.
On Friday evening, the fire caused the lights to go out for 41,000 affected residents and residents in several municipalities.
The utility Westnetz reported that on Saturday numerous emergency generators were in operation until the large-scale disturbance was finally completely resolved late in the evening.
Firefighters and helpers and helpers of the THW provided support in the municipalities.
Authorities offered care places in schools and called for help from neighbors.
The supplier thanked the affected people for their patience and the helpers for their efforts.
We are very aware that the last 24 hours have brought significant restrictions.
We would also like to thank the affected municipalities, the district, the fire brigades and the THW for their tireless efforts," said the head of the Primary Technology department, Florian Witt, in a statement on Saturday evening.
The repair of the damage will take a few more days, as the Westnetz workers were only able to put some of the lines back into operation provisionally, he explained.
A technical defect led to the fire, according to the company.
Electricity is flowing again
The fire that broke out at around 7.15 p.m. on Friday severely damaged parts of the 10,000-volt switchgear at the Neunkirchen-Seelscheid substation, according to Westnetz.
There, extensive cleaning and repair work is necessary.
At the same time, a connection to a 30,000-volt voltage level was created.
With the help of this bypass, the power supply is back.
Since 6 p.m. on Saturday, more than 21,000 people in Much and Ruppichteroth have had electricity again.
Another 20,000 residents of Neunkirchen-Seelscheid were gradually connected from 9.30 p.m.
Since 11:15 p.m., those affected by the outage have also had electricity.
Over 80 electricians from Westnetz and partner companies were involved.
The authorities had also called for help from the community after setting up an emergency power supply for important buildings on Saturday afternoon.
"Now it is important that citizens take care of elderly or lonely people in their neighbourhood and let the local fire stations know if help is needed," explained Sebastian Schuster (CDU), the district administrator, after a crisis meeting.
When setting up and operating emergency power generators, the focus was mainly on the residents of nursing homes.
In addition, according to authorities, temporary care places were set up in schools for those people who could not take care of themselves or who need electricity-dependent medical devices or are dependent on medical care.
Guten Tag!
Unfortunately, the ceiling in Germany is sold out.
Can I buy them from you and pay in euros?
It is the #PRS_ORG# day blanket in blue-green.
I hope you have a nice day too and please stay healthy ♡
I can't mount the undercarriage on the table top, though.
It is Custom #NAME#.
There are three versions of it.
We wanted those with tabletops with a diameter of #NUMBER#
We have a diameter of 155cm.
Today my #PRS_ORG# arrived, however I can't slide them together to shorten them.
Can you help me with that?
Otherwise I would have to send it back, as it is not suitable for the purpose.
I would appreciate feedback
Yes, that is really easier!
Then we'll do it this way!
Can you send me the return label by email?
The repair is now complete.
I had already tried this before the chat.
However, I had not restarted the E-#PRS_ORG# before the purchase.
Should I do it now?
I find such a low credit almost impertinent.
We do not agree with that
Nordic Combined: Riiber wins
The German Nordic Combined skiers Fabian Rießle and Julian Schmid have sprinted onto the podium at the World Cup in Otepää, Estonia.
The duo had to give in once again to the outstanding Norwegian Jarl Magnus Riiber, who had already started with a large lead after the ski jump.
Return of order number #NUMBER#
When will the money be transferred back into my account?
Yes, we have both updated it and we are using version 4.5...
It could be that they have heard of problems before
I bought a book directly with my #PRS_ORG#, it seems to be on it too.
When I want to open it, I get the message, oops!
This document could not be opened.
If the file is faulty, contact customer service.
As far as I can tell it is a #PRS_ORG# epub file.
Can they help me?
Chat connection is gone and now what?
I also have to work in between!
To ensure that the paint application is even and clean, you should clean the parts with some soapy water to remove dust, grease and fingerprints, rinse with clear water and dry.
Before you put the brush on the model for the first time with a new color, it is recommended to practice 2 to 3 strokes.
You can do this on the later invisible inside of the building parts or on a yogurt cup.
The first mark on the part
Draw the brush line by line in a uniform manner.
A slight overlap of the paint layers later ensures an even surface.
Avoid swiping the brush back and forth quickly.
This creates unrealistically large areas.
A model is not a garden fence.
Start with the light colors.
Otherwise, the dark ones could shine through later.
Metallic tones and metallic colours come at the very end with a separate brush.
Otherwise, unsightly metal streaks can occur when they are mixed with regular paints.
Let the painted parts dry for a day before you install them.
The models achieve an original look through the decals or stickers.
From insignia on aircraft to ship names to trim and badges on car models: the decals give the model the finishing touch.
Apply the decals in the correct order while the parts are still easily accessible.
An aircraft cockpit can be or is easier to cover before it is installed in the fuselage.
Time, patience and a steady hand are more important than the right tools like scissors, tweezers and toothpicks when it comes to sticking.
Cut out each needed decal individually and arrange them.
Decals are also called waterslide decals because you briefly wet the back of them with water until the backing paper turns dark from the moisture.
Then you just slide the image a little bit off the paper and place the piece on the corresponding place on the model (which you also pre-wetted).
While holding the decal in place on the model with a tool, you pull the backing paper off to the side.
Caution: Always check first that the image is in the right place before sliding it completely off the paper, so that it does not stick to your finger, crease or even tear.
Suck up excess water with a household cloth.
Warning: Not suitable for children under 3 years
I can only open a book for a short time, once I look for something else then I can't read the book anymore and I have to log out and log in and reload the book and find the place where I was reading up to.
I have already communicated with you on Saturday.
Can I get this by email?
Also for all 3 packages?
Because the lamp came in 3 separate packages
OK, thanks anyway!
Then I will buy elsewhere once the money is back.
But can I get it back without any problems?
Private health insurance for fertility treatment / What is an "insurance case"?
Hello everyone,
We have been in fertility treatment for some time, now when it comes to billing the private health insurance, they are suddenly standing in the way.
One after the other:
We had applied for the fertility treatment in advance at the PKV and received approval for three attempts.
The experiments were in no way (e.g. time frame, success, etc.) restricted.
The first attempt led directly to a successful pregnancy and birth and was billed to the private health insurance.
Some time later, we tried to have a second child, and we carried out 2 (unsuccessful) attempts, but we had not yet claimed these from the private health insurance.
We applied again to the private health insurance to cover the costs and were granted three more attempts.
After a few more attempts (we have done more attempts than promised, of course the most expensive ones are covered by the private health insurance), we submitted the bills to the private health insurance and received the nasty surprise: instead of 5 attempts (2+3), the private health insurance will only reimburse 3 attempts.
The reason: With the pregnancy/birth, the remaining 2 attempts of the first commitment fall away.
The second child wish is a new insurance case.
According to the terms and conditions of insurance, however, "The insurance event begins with the start of medical treatment, it ends when there is no longer a need for treatment."
The questions for the experts in the round here:
* Who is right here, the private health insurance (only 3 attempts are reimbursed) or us (5 attempts are to be reimbursed)?
* Would the private health insurance have to inform us in the promises that with a birth the further attempts would expire?
* Is the desire for a second child really a new insurance case?
The infertility (caused by blocked fallopian tubes) is not cured by the first child.
It would be great if the experts here would give their opinion.
Thanks in advance for your help!
Can you please email me the three options and tell me how best to reach them again
Okay.
We will never order from them again.
If they add my sales and my friend #NAME#'s (same address) they have obviously lost a good customer.
They can pass this on to their manager.
That is not competitive.
Yesterday, my colleague told me that the repayment was initiated and now you are telling me that I have to send the thing back first.
I can't help it if the chest of drawers arrives completely damaged
Please see in the screenshot what the colleague wrote
It clearly states that the refund was requested and I still have not received a refund via #PRS_ORG#
They can tell their manager that they have now lost two regular customers.
My friend also ordered various pieces of furniture for our apartment using his account.
We will no longer do that.
No, the defect only appeared after a few months.
An office chair must be able to withstand normal use.
Otherwise, they are not allowed to sell it as an office chair.
Regardless, the 24-month warranty applies.
No, I am not able to get a different kind of packaging.
I will take the wardrobe apart and make it available to the transport company.
Good afternoon, I have a question about your series of #PRS_ORG#
These products are advertised with additional footstools, but unfortunately we cannot find them with you.
Can they help?
Topic of the week: The best low budget films
There is no general definition of what a low-budget film is, with exact budget limits.
Wikipedia has this to say about it:
A **low-budget film** or **low-budget movie** is a motion picture shot with little to no funding from a major film studio or private investor.
Online, you can find plenty of lists of low-budget films, such as on Letterboxd.com.
Do you know any interesting representatives of this category?
What attracts you to it?
And what do you not like at all?
I am a very good customer of yours, I have already furnished two apartments completely with your furniture.
I wanted to get the best price for the grey leather Odelle sofa.
The delivery time has been extended again, is it reliable now?
Thank you
Yours sincerely
If there is no phone number, a chat where you have to wait 30 minutes is not a chat!
Unfortunately, nothing changes in the waiting position...I will give up again soon because it just doesn't work here.
Hello
"Half victory" against Belarus with high costs for the EU
According to the political expert Raphael Bossong, the EU can announce a "half victory" in the conflict with the Belarusian regime.
However, the costs are very high and mean massive violations of the rights of migrants and refugees at the Belarus border with Poland and Lithuania, said Bossong to the Evangelical Press Service (epd).
The EU has not solved the confrontation in a sustainable way, explained the researcher from the Berlin Foundation for Science and Politics (SWP).
This state of suspended animation - Belarus is not quite giving in, but the EU feels like a winner - is likely to continue for some time.
The way people at the border are treated is not in line with the European Convention on Human Rights, Bossong ruled.
Apparently, there is an "increasing normalisation of pushbacks" by individual EU governments.
Since the EU as a whole is not determined to oppose it, it is at the expense of fundamental rights.
This development is also weakening the cohesion in the Union.
"She can't seem to get her way if a member state decides to do its own thing," as is currently the case with Poland, which does not even allow the EU border protection agency Frontex access to the border.
In addition, the EU is paying another price for its policy at the border with Belarus, according to Bossong: A basic agreement on asylum policy is being made more difficult because the line "border protection, border protection, border protection" has been strengthened.
Another attempt to cross the border
According to Poland's border guard, meanwhile, migrants have again tried to enter Polish territory via Belarus.
Fifty-five migrants were arrested and returned to the border overnight, a spokeswoman for the authority said on Sunday.
The Polish officials were pelted with stones by the migrants near the village of Czeremsza.
According to reports, one soldier was hit in the face and had to be medically treated by a military doctor.
In total, the border guards registered 52 attempted border crossings within 24 hours.
Already on Friday evening, a group of 28 migrants had overcome the border barriers.
Thousands of people from countries like Iraq and Afghanistan had crossed or tried to cross the Belarus-EU border in recent months.
The EU accuses Alexander Lukashenko, the ruler in Minsk, of luring them with the prospect of entry into the EU.
Poland and Lithuania reportedly closed sections of their borders.
The EU sanctioned Belarus and threatened airlines that bring migrants and refugees into the country.
In addition, EU commissioners travelled to the countries of origin of the people to prevent them from leaving.
The most effective element of the EU's response was the pressure on the airlines, said Bossong.
"There, the EU has thrown its market power into the balance and demonstrated its determination to operate with a heavy hand and extraterritorial sanctions".
Minsk must also consider the internal political costs.
The Belarusian society is probably not prepared for the fact that the security apparatus regularly lets thousands of people through the country.
Mercedes protests after controversial Formula 1 finale
According to Mercedes, Max Verstappen committed two rule violations during the race.
Abu Dhabi - After the controversial Formula 1 finale in Abu Dhabi, Mercedes has lodged an appeal.
The Silver Arrows suspect two rule breaks in the last Grand Prix of the year.
A protest relates to an alleged infringement by Max Verstappen in the Red Bull in the final safety car phase, when he was said to have overtaken illegally.
A second protest was lodged against the result at the end of the race.
According to Mercedes, the protocol was not followed in a rule-compliant manner.
Verstappen had overtaken Lewis Hamilton in the Mercedes on the last lap and raced to his first Formula 1 title.
The manoeuvre took place shortly after the end of a safety car phase, in which the Dutch driver had overtaken the car in front of him.
I'll check it out.
I'll talk to the bank and get back to you
Thanks for the support
Free admission for members: Europa-Park holds SC Freiburg fan day
The Europa-Park, named after the Europa-Park Stadium of the Sport-Club Freiburg, has invited to the SC Freiburg Fan Day.
As the park reports, members and season ticket holders of the sports club from Breisgau, as well as members of the fan community, were allowed to visit Europa-Park free of charge on that day.
In addition, there were vouchers for drinks and sausages.
The roller coaster cars lit up in red and white on this day.
Füchsle, Ed Euromaus and many red-and-white balloons provided the perfect backdrop," said the park.
The cooperation between the Bundesliga club and the leisure park in Rust, 40 kilometers north of Freiburg, has existed since the beginning of the 1990s.
At the first SC Freiburg Fantag in Europa-Park, it was once again shown how well the partnership fits.
Seeing beaming fans having fun together on the roller coaster confirms this," says Europa-Park owner Jürgen Mack.
Why is it €#NUMBER# and not like originally 1699€?

Judith Hermann read from her novel "Daheim"
As part of the reading series "LiteraTour Nord", author Judith Hermann read from her current novel "Daheim" on Friday in the sold-out Blue Note and also acted as moderator.
She is divorced, lives in a house by the sea and listens sensitively to the nocturnal sounds at her front door.
I submitted the contact form to return an item yesterday, but have not received an email confirmation or anything like that.
My question is whether my request has been received.
Not everyone has the time for your stupid chat and cheap junk from China.
Your mistake to fix and not all of us from our household.
Contact Mrs. #NAME#.
I can't chat with them every day
We had chatted yesterday and agreed that I or Mrs. #NAME# would receive an email with a 60 Euro voucher, a new order of the #PRS_ORG# nightstand and a return label.
This email has not yet arrived.
The package is to be delivered to #PRS_ORG# today.
Please contact me

Sorry, but just because he says he's not an anti-Semite doesn't mean anything.
That's like when a German says he has nothing against foreigners.
Neither of them will admit their i.
But Kollegah constantly reproduces some kind of anti-Semitic messages.
If you want to distance yourself, then you should just let it go completely.
Yes, wow, then you're just as little to be taken seriously as Kollegah.
Anyone who seriously questions evolution is just completely lost.
In my opinion, a god has set the whole thing in motion.
But once you're a creationist, you have to believe that the Earth is 10,000 years old and that science is just a load of rubbish.
And with that, you are an enemy of science and not to be taken seriously like Kollegah
To achieve an optimal field of view, the magnifying glass should be brought as close to the eye as possible.
The specially aplanatic-achromatic lens system allows you to use the magnifying glass practically without distortion and colour errors up to the edge zone.
Often, magnifiers are marked with magnification specifications.
However, these figures are only valid for exactly defined conditions, which rarely correspond to the conditions of use.
To get the most out of your loupe, please follow the instructions in the "Technical Data" table (See instructions for use in the packaging).
Light reflections occur on the lens surfaces of all optical devices - including magnifying glasses.
These reflections are significantly reduced by an anti-reflective coating.
If the optimal conditions of use - magnifying glass close to the eye - are observed, reflections on the lens surfaces are less noticeable.
Further information can be found in the enclosed user manual (available in German and English).

Christmas tree sale in Schönwolde: In the municipality of Krembz, women choose the Christmas trees
Farmer Frank Diers has experienced many a curious situation when selling Christmas trees.
In one case, a man is said to have driven home without his partner, because the two could not agree.
Every year, he plants about 2,000 of them.
The 56-year-old has already experienced many curious situations.
This makes the pre-Christmas season a little more fun, he says.
And what about the voucher?
Otherwise I'm gone as a customer?!
After all, I received a defective delivery and now I have to pay the full price for it.
Then I will rate it accordingly!
We don't need to have a debate here about which is the better dish, but there is a certain similarity between the two.
Both consist of meat that is grilled on a rotating skewer.
And both have their names for this reason.
In German, an equivalent might be something like the "Dreher", which doesn't sound nearly as tasty.
Problems with fibre optic + Devolo DLan/Magic
We have had a new fibre-optic connection in the house for a few weeks.
Unfortunately, I am now having problems setting up a stable Wi-Fi network.
Before that, I had a 50 Mbit DSL connection and used Devolo DLan, which received and sent 50 Mbit without any problems, except for a few outages.
The new fibre optic connection sends 500 Mbit to the FritzBox 7590 and the DLan module, which is connected to the FritzBox, also receives them.
However, the other DLan module, which sends the Wifi, does not get the full 500, but the further I am from the module in the house, the less I get (so I use a socket that is 1, 2, 3, etc. rooms away from the other module).
This means that the Internet with the new fiber optic connection is now even slower on the first floor than before (\~45 Mbit).
I have also ordered a new Devolo Magic set, which apparently uses a new technology.
This was slightly better than the DLan, but here too there were similarly large losses.
Could someone explain to me why so much internet speed is "lost" over the power line with fiber optic?
And is LAN really the only solution?
It would be extremely time-consuming to lay LAN cables in the house.
I'm really desperate, which is why I've created an account here.
Therefore, I would be all the more pleased to receive an answer.
When it's time to switch current accounts
Anyone who thought that now there would be peace with the current accounts is being deceived.
While many banks have used the autumn to get their customers to confirm the fee increases of the past with all sorts of tricks, the free limits for negative interest rates are also falling further.
The Deutsche Bank, for example, was considered relatively generous with a limit of 100,000 euros.
Now she has halved the tax-free allowance and even quadrupled it for daily money.
In a first step, the limit was only lowered for customers of the group's Postbank division - to 50,000 euros for current and investment accounts and to 25,000 euros for savings accounts.
However, these lower allowances now apply to the entire Deutsche Bank, as a spokesman confirmed on request.
And not just for new contracts, but also for "new individual agreements made with existing customers".
The Commerzbank had already gone down to a limit of 50,000 euros, which is still in force, as is the case with ING Deutschland.
The direct bank DKB, which is particularly popular with cost-conscious customers, has lowered the free limits in two stages, first to 50,000 euros, and now to 25,000 euros.
After all: More than 100 banks now have a tax-free limit of 25,000 euros or less, according to figures from the internet portal Verivox.
The Sparda Bank Berlin has also arrived at 25,000 euros: However, there is still a legal dispute with the consumer centres, which have even won in the first instance before the Berlin Regional Court against this regulation.
Now, the banks are already discussing whether the institutes should perhaps make provisions - in case the higher authorities also declare negative interest rates to be inadmissible in principle and many millions have to be paid back to bank customers.

Jennifer Aniston has an entire beauty army
She is now officially at the top of Hollywood.
But their lives are like a roller coaster.
Jennifer Aniston (52) was chosen by the US magazine "The Hollywood Reporter" as the most influential woman of the year.
For her, who made a splash in 2021 with the "Friends" reunion and the continuation of her series "The Morning Show", this success is primarily the result of a lot of discipline and work.
An army of assistants, stylists and trainers take care of her appearance.
After all, says Aniston, she treats herself to one chip a day (yes, you read that right: one SINGLE chip from the bag).
That her heart is still beating for both male and female fans is actually a miracle.
Maybe she's just unlucky in love - and still looking for the great love.
And crossed off the baby wish from the list.
Previously, she was constantly asked when she would become a mother.
It hurt her.
The people who asked that have no idea what's going on with me personally, medically, why I can't.
It was really hurtful.
Let's hope that success and fame also make you happy.
An undignified end to a career: Räikkönen has to give up
Kimi Räikkönen's departure from Formula 1 was even quieter than expected.
Abu Dhabi - The 42-year-old Finn took off his gloves and wiped the sweat from his forehead.
That's it.
After a driving error and a slight collision with a band, Räikkönen had to stop his Alfa Romeo at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix after less than half the race distance.
It was his 349th and last Grand Prix, the "Iceman" ends his career in the top class of motorsport.
His wife Minttu and their two children had also travelled to the United Arab Emirates to say goodbye.
Räikkönen's greatest success was winning the 2007 World Championship in a Ferrari.
He won 21 Grand Prix, started 18 times from pole and finished on the podium 103 times. dpa
Friedrich wins 60th World Cup - Nolte wins in two-man bob - Sport
The mark of the Norwegian biathlete Ole Einar Björndalen with 94 successes is the goal of the bobsledder.
"I did the math, I would have to win nine and a half races per season, then I could make it to Cortina 2026," said the double Olympic champion from the BSC Oberbärenburg, who recorded two successes in two days at the races in Winterberg.
On Saturday, he fended off the attack of Johannes Lochner by five hundredths of a second, in which he drove from third to first place.
Then he changed something in the material setting and on Sunday he pulled out a bigger lead with 0.30 seconds.
With his team Thorsten Margis (SV Halle), Candy Bauer (BSC Oberbärenburg) and Alexander Schüller (SV Halle), he beat the Brit Brad Hall.
The Austrian Benjamin Maier came in third.
"We took a bigger risk today and were rewarded," said Friedrich, who also won his 22nd race in a row.
The Berchtesgaden Johannes Lochner, who was driving for Stuttgart, came in fifth place after previously coming in second.
Christoph Hafer from BC Bad Feilnbach landed in eighth place after finishing fourth in the first race.
"If I knew what he was doing differently, I would do it that way too," said Lochner.
Nolte with home victory - Podium for Jamanka
Laura Nolte won her third season victory in the two-man bob on her home track.
After only finishing fourth the day before in the monobob, she raced to a World Cup victory on Sunday in the German triple success with pusher Deborah Levi.
The two-bob Olympic champion Mariama Jamanka from the BRC Thuringia came in second with Germany's fastest sprinter, Alexandra Burghardt from Burghausen.
In addition to her Olympic qualification, she recorded her first podium finish this winter.
Wiesbaden's Kim Kalicki landed in third place with Leonie Fiebig.
For me it was supercool, first podium in the World Cup, I'm superhappy that Mariama is taking me along.
I'm super happy with the development.
There is still a lot of potential at the start, but the start times today were okay," said Burghardt and emphasised: "It's not just about pushing, but there is also a lot to do around it".
Jamanka was a little annoyed by the not-quite-flawless rides, but said: "It's going in the right direction."
I had the duvet in my basket and could buy it now!!!
What am I supposed to do?
I have not received it and therefore could not redeem it, which is why I finally asked.
Last year, I had completely different problems because of Corona and never had time for it.
And now it was said that he was out of date, which made me very angry.
Look in the chat, it was about the Asare bench.
I want to return it and then re-order as it's on sale right now :)
Why is the shipment not started until 16.3?
There was nothing on your website about such a long delivery time
No, only when I tap on it does an extra field appear with the message
It was taken yesterday by your colleague.
Why is this a problem today?
I also sent you pictures of the wrong item that was delivered.
But we still want the shelf module, just a new, undamaged one
And not cancel the entire order.
Only this day, only this week, only until XY...
Hello dear great girls and girls and women,
I have some things I just want to write down and maybe it's the same for one or the other...
I'm 24, I have PTSD, I'm a full-time student and a dog mom - apart from the fact that my dog doesn't cry or go to kindergarten, he's actually my child.
My boyfriend (of 6 years) is sick, got a 2nd degree burn on Monday and has been depressed for years (but is now in therapy).
I visited him yesterday because I also have emotional needs and because I want to see and feel him. We cuddled a lot and it was nice.
I helped him in the shower (because his hand is bandaged due to a burn).
He's also got a cold and we're seeing each other less at the moment (1-2x a week) which is very difficult for me with my needs for affection and love.
My puppy has just got a tummy ache, I cooked for him and now he's lying in his snuggle blanket and has relaxed a bit after I was there with the heat lamp and stroking for him.
I live with my sister and my mother, and she's away for a month.
Now we also have homework to do, which of course we divide up.
But even cooking is a lot of work for me...
My PTSD is currently well-managed, I'm half-way through therapy and I'm coping.
Not good, but I'm coping and I'm almost symptom-free.
My university is currently demanding a lot (for me), tomorrow at 3pm I have a written test for which I have not done anything yet, and the day after tomorrow I have an anatomy class for which I should at least prepare a bit.
And next week I have an oral exam on Tuesday, and what comes next is in my calendar and not in my head because there is no more room there.
So my week goes like this: Only until tomorrow, then it's the weekend.
But then it goes on?
Only until the birthday.
Only until the start of the holidays.
Only until the weekend.
Only until...
And so it goes on forever.
I think I'm just so stressed that I need those mental cues or else I'm not going to do it.
Somehow I feel guilty and "chaotic", but I can't do it any other way...
Do you feel the same way?
Honestly, I'm so grateful that I don't have to work.
I'm really infinitely grateful, I can't even put it into words.
I don't know if I would have survived my kptbs otherwise.
I think that also has something to do with the mental load of women, and that's why I thought I'd find fellow sufferers here...
I wish you a restful evening, the week is almost over!
I received my order today, unfortunately the whole thing is a different colour plus the surface is scratched and the table leg has a mark.
The first delivery was exactly the same colour as on the website.
We are very disappointed!!!!
What can you offer me?
If we switch tables now, will I get a different color or what?
The email to cancel was sent on 26.12.#NUMBER#.
In fact, twice.
However, it was not confirmed.
Something completely different: I noticed at school that many religion teachers do not believe in God and for them it is just another subject like maths or geography.
For me, it was always a bit strange, perhaps also because I was raised as a Christian and I always believed in it somehow.
How do you feel about that?
Perhaps you can also tell us about work or study colleagues with different attitudes.
Basically, I understand the difference between private and professional and it makes sense to separate them.
There is also a curriculum and so on.
But I would also find it strange to have a physics teacher who doesn't believe in relativity.
What makes someone want to teach religion if they don't believe in it?
Preserve culture or something like that?
I hope your question isn't too personal.
Can it not be changed or not? Please write in English, I understand it well.
That's a very long time, then I would refrain from it
That's good, thank you.
I expect a response in the near future, at the latest by the beginning of next week.
Thank you for your support #NAME#.
Film search help please
Hello everyone,
I'm looking for a film from my childhood (I'm 24).
I think it was a film for young people.
The film has two time axes (or parallel worlds).
On the one hand, there is the modern world (the real world).
On the other hand, the past (or the land of the dead) (not sure).
Since I can't really describe it in the real world, there's a young woman.
And in the realm of the dead, a young soldier (uniform similar to that of the soldiers from Pirates of the Caribbean).
For some reason, the paths cross and a plot is created.
The antagonist is also a soldier from the realm of the dead who wants to bring the woman into this realm so that he can live himself, I mean.
The transition is also, I believe, the grave of the soldier.
In the end, I believe both soldiers are fighting against each other.
If that means anything to you, I'm grateful for any response.
Our little one has only slept on her front from week 1.
Fast forward: still alive :D
Relax.
A child can take a lot more than you think.
Make sure everything else is right, no cuddly toys, go in more often and look, but no minutes of surveillance.
That makes you crazy!
Fresh air in the room.
A good mattress.
No pillows.
Oh, and ours didn't have a sleeping bag, but always a blanket.
Watch your child when he or she is asleep.
Does it turn its head to the side?
Can it lift itself up from its belly?
Or is it face down in the mattress?
You can tell from that whether everything is in order.
We have all grown up and when my husband was born, it was common practice to put the kids on their stomachs to sleep.
In addition, we are already "regular customers" of yours and have already bought a lot of items
But why are you only offering me 20 euros?
Hello, I have already written to one of your colleagues yesterday and have not yet received a response.
It's about my wardrobe that arrived yesterday (order number: #ALPHANUMERIC-ID#).
The right-hand drawer doesn't fit in the cupboard.
I ask you to contact me as soon as possible.
The cupboard is currently unusable.
To put it simply.
RBTV has promised a lot.
And yes, I know myself that not everything can be held.
And I also had a lot of fun with RBTV.
It's just that the politics of this station are now at rock bottom.
Almost every format is sponsored (ok), but then go on a big begging tour at the same time.
It was said that one was an "independent" Internet broadcaster.
Quote from Arno: "We don't want to be a running billboard."
What are you now?
An 0815 advertising station that is trying to sell its BilloMerch to the elite fan.
And then we have Marah's Do's and Don'ts.
Naturally, they apply to everyone, except Simon and Etienne.
They are of course allowed to continue to insult people.
A Krogmann who is completely lacking in empathy and who is trying to make a profit at the expense of the action with the rented rooms that have exploded.
How can you like all of this?
It's great if you like it, I find it terrible.
I am requesting a call back as my delivered wooden table was delivered defective.
Corpus fracture due to damaged delivery of the #PRS_ORG#.
Whether as a comforter for stomach ache or just for cuddling - my little heat buddy is versatile.
Cherry pit pillows are a traditional home remedy for soothing heat applications, as cherry pits can hold and release heat well.
The removable inner cushion is easily heated in the microwave or oven.
The soft material makes the application particularly pleasant, so that the little ones feel safe, even when they are not feeling well.
The cherry pit cushion with cover is suitable as a heat pack only for the following areas of application:
Before heating, check for unusual smell, stock or burn marks and discard immediately if present.
Please remove the inner cushion from the cover to warm it up first!
Heat in the microwave at a maximum of 300 watts for a maximum of 2 minutes (follow the instructions of the microwave manufacturer!)
Immediately after heating, distribute the heat evenly in the pillow by shaking!
Then place the inner cushion back into the cover.
During the first warm-ups, slight moisture may form on the surface, but this disappears with repeated applications.
Be sure to follow the recommended heating instructions, as longer times or higher energy levels can cause damage (risk of ignition and burns!).
Before heating a kiss in the microwave, check that heating grain products is allowed in the manufacturer's instructions.
After the heated inner cushion has been put back into the cover, please check the temperature of the cushion for suitability for babies (max. 43 °C) at your elbow!
Do not use the pillow for acute and chronic, inflammatory or febrile conditions, circulatory problems, fresh hematomas, bruises and open wounds, and for people with reduced pain sensitivity.
If you have existing skin, heart, vein, diabetes or cancer conditions, or if you are pregnant, please consult a doctor before use.
If seams have opened and loose kernels are coming out, discard the product and the loose kernels immediately and out of reach of children.
If the product is used on babies under 1 year of age, the child's temperature should be monitored regularly during use to prevent overheating!
All serious incidents related to the product must be reported to the manufacturer and to the competent authority of the country in which the user is established.
The cover is removable and can be washed in the machine at 30 °C.
Please note the care symbols on the product!
Darmstadt second after the first leg - Pauli wins in Düsseldorf
Darmstadt 98 may dream of returning to the football Bundesliga.
Meanwhile, Hannover 96 is working its way out of the table cellar.
For Ingolstadt, it is not going well even under the third coach.
Jubilation in Darmstadt after the late victory in the top game, joy in Hannover over interim coach Christoph Dabrowski and frustration in Ingolstadt after the unsuccessful start under the new coach Rüdiger Rehm.
Is the battery broken?
Last night my laptop (ThinkPad E480 20KQ and about 3 years old) was no longer charged by my power supply.
I bought this about 5 months ago, so it should still work.
I thought the power supply alone was enough to operate it.
No luck, the battery is empty and the laptop won't start despite the power supply being plugged in.
I then removed the battery, but nothing happened here either.
Maybe you have ideas?
A new battery has been ordered, but why can't I use the laptop in online mode?
Is something else broken?
Thank you for your help!
I want the delivery of the #PRS_ORG# to the room.
How can I book it?
I'm interested in the #PRS_ORG# chair.
But I don't know how high the seat is...
Often on tour and yet taking a lot of equipment with you?
No problem with the Everyday V2 Backpack from Peak Design!
Its 20-litre capacity can also swallow larger photo equipment without problems, which can be safely stored using the padded FlexFold dividers.
And what else you need for everyday items, remains well organised and can be separated from the camera equipment thanks to the practical access in the individually configurable interior.
With the "update" of the Everyday Line to version 2 (V2), the series is presented in a new look.
The sleek, minimalist design has it all - with the Everyday Backpack series, Peak Design has developed some highly innovative solutions that reliably protect the interior of the backpack while still providing instant access to photographic equipment.
This works in two ways: first, conventionally, via the lid flap, which can be closed with the MagLatch closure system, a brilliantly thought-out solution for effective protection that has already proven itself in the Messenger bags.
The closure flap has a metal closure hook with matching anchor bars on the front of the backpack.
Unlike most backpacks, Peak Design has thought of different "fill levels": there are 4 anchor bars, stably riveted, into which the closure hook can be hooked.
If the rucksack is fully loaded, you just take the top beam, if it is rather empty, a deeper one.
The flap closure and the hook are also magnetic.
In this way, the backpack can also be closed reliably without resting the hook.
The second option also fundamentally distinguishes the Everyday Backpack from other photo backpacks: In addition to the lid flap, there is also a zip opening on both sides of the backpack.
This eliminates the biggest drawback of traditional backpacks with top access - you no longer have to dig through your contents!
At the same time, this clever detail increases the practicality of the backpack enormously: If you take not only your photo equipment, but also everyday items or travel luggage with you.
In the Everyday Backpack, you can individually configure the interior (more on this below) and thus store both things separately from each other - and access them independently through the two side openings.
You can also pull the backpack forward from the right side to access the camera gear in the right main compartment, while the everyday items stay safely in the left half of the backpack and don't get in the way.
Comfortable, easy-to-adjust carrying straps help with this.
And since the outer shell of the backpack is also made entirely from 100% recycled, weather-resistant nylon, the contents will stay dry even if it's going to Scotland in the fall.
Unfortunately, I am waiting in vain for the email from their support.
#NAME# sent me an email yesterday to confirm the assignment of the
The freight forwarder has announced contact to collect the wrongly delivered table.
So far, I have not received any message.
I ask for immediate settlement.
I'm already writing with the third support employee, none of them got me further than the promise that I'll get an email as confirmation.
This is the return of the incorrectly delivered Custom #NAME#
Is it foreseeable when the cupboard could be delivered again?
Keeping him like this is not an option for me...
It works.
Thank you so much for your help
I wish you a nice evening
Hello, my order number is #NUMBER#. When will the item be delivered?
The order and payment was on 12.1.21.
I was sent a completely different lamp than I ordered
Please call me
If you extend the voucher, I will place a larger order, but at least I kept the damaged piece of furniture and didn't send it back.
And that the past year turned out differently than expected, I could not have foreseen, and so I was not able to redeem and clarify it in a timely manner.
But I suffered damage as a customer, and I don't accept that.
Rotinger brake discs are designed for the demands of the dynamic driver, who knows how to appreciate reliability and safety when braking even under difficult conditions.
Rotinger brake discs are made from cast iron and then mechanically worked (drilled and cut).
All tinted windows are produced in short series according to individual technical characteristics, which are specific to certain windows and patterns.
On the basis of the individual technical drawing, a special manufacturing programme is created, which is adjusted to the balancing of the disc according to the characteristics of the original assembly.
The modified discs produced in this way ensure high comfort and braking effectiveness.
Additional openings created increase the effectiveness of cooling the disc, with the slots improving the cleaning of the brake discs and brake pads.
The aesthetic properties of our custom-made windows emphasise the character of each car through an attractive and striking appearance.
Coloma is the town where an unexpected event shaped the history of the West Coast.
In the winter of 1848, a man discovered glowing nuggets in the water at the south fork of the American River.
Although he tried to keep his discovery a secret, the news spread quickly and triggered the so-called "California Gold Rush" of '49.
Thousands came from near and far, making Coloma one of the fastest growing and most prosperous cities in the country.
Areas were staked out, tents were set up, and saloons and hotels were built almost overnight.
Everyone wanted their share of the country's wealth.
For many, it was "Coloma or Bust!"
In this game you are a pioneer looking for wealth in the West and wanting to make a name for yourself.
You'll search for gold, recruit workers, gather horses and build businesses.
You will also have the opportunity to explore the surrounding waterways and adjoining areas.
You are not alone - the other pioneers seem to have the same idea!
You have to outdo your pioneer colleagues or you'll go under with the rest of them.
Coloma is a fast-paced strategy game with many paths to victory.
You simultaneously choose your actions, have to manage your resources and build a tableau that works more and more for you (so-called "engine building").
The buildings on your tableau allow you to become more efficient, gain additional actions, or apply rules in your favor.
With these buildings and the dynamic bridge tiles, you can develop your own individual play style with fine adjustments.
Coloma covers a three-year period from 1848 (the year gold was discovered in Coloma), through 1849 (the year of the California Gold Rush) to 1850 (the year California achieved official statehood).
A year in Coloma consists of five rounds.
During each round, players secretly and simultaneously choose a location on the game board where they can perform actions.
Then their selection is revealed and they place their Pioneers in the appropriate locations.
If a location has the most pioneers, it gets a lock!
This disables one half of the location - reducing the possible actions there.
Then players take turns performing actions such as gathering resources, moving wagons, setting up tents, scouting rivers, building bridges, opening shops, and positioning gunfighters.
When all actions are completed, the Pioneers return.
The announcer rotates to a new location at the start of each round, changing the available actions.
This continues until the announcer has moved five times, thus covering each location once, and the year ends.
There's a shootout in which players must defend Coloma from a raid by angry bandits.
If the players have contributed enough gunfighters and outnumber the bandits, they receive rewards.
But if they fail, they get smaller rewards or end up in the graveyard.
The game ends after the third shootout, and then the final score is announced.
The player with the most victory points wins!
For free shipping, I take up to the dimensions of 35 x 25 x 4.5 cm the shipping method, goods shipment (games in foil).
For everything else, usually DPD, insured and with tracking (games wrapped in foil, wrapped in tiles and packing paper).
If you are a collector, I can also send the box in a box for an extra 2 euros, so that it is 100% safe from printing.
"Why children are not tyrants" documentary, ARD Mediathek
CW psychological violence, sexual abuse, abuse of power
The ARD documentary appeared in my Twitter timeline today, and I watched it right away.
>The child psychiatrist Michael Winterhoff is a frequent guest on talk shows and gives lectures throughout Europe.
With his book "Why our children become tyrants" (2008), he triggered a fierce debate on education.
Former patients and guardians are now making serious allegations against him.
Please take care of yourselves, the film is hard to watch.
And I am very grateful that many people now think and act differently.
It must never, never, never be about power over the child for us parents and other responsible persons.
Our goal must always be to give the child space for its development and to make the framework for the child as large as it is sensible and possible in the situation.
Brrr, it still chills me.
Holetschek: Countries are discussing the end of the test requirement for triple-vaccinated people
The health ministers of the states want to decide on a nationwide abolition of the test requirement for triple-vaccinated people at their next meeting.
"We countries need clarity quickly on whether and when the test requirement can be lifted for those who have been vaccinated three times," said Klaus Holetschek (CSU), chairman of the Conference of Health Ministers, to "Bild am Sonntag".
The removal of 2G plus for triple-vaccinated people is "not only medically sensible, but also provides an additional incentive to get vaccinated," said Holetschek.
Federal Health Minister Karl Lauterbach (SPD) has promised that "he will make a proposal to the Health Ministers' Conference as early as next Tuesday". - afp
So I want to send the lamp back
What is the best way to go about this?
Hi, I think the #PRS_ORG# chair is very nice, but I can't see how high the seat is.
Can you help me?
I can no longer do my #PRS_ORG# shopping.
Notice: Oops, an error occurred.
Shopping through the #PRS_ORG# website on the computer works.
I have updated my account details.
What could be the reason for this?
What you describe is called "awareness," or sensory perception under general anesthesia.
These occur with a frequency of about 1 in 1000.
Most commonly, it is hearing sounds/voices, less commonly seeing images, and very rarely experiencing pain.
Relevant to this topic: C-sections are operations that come with an increased rate of awareness, as a very deep anesthesia is avoided to protect the baby until it is weaned.
Previous episodes of awareness should be mentioned during the pre-anaesthetic interview.
Certain anaesthetic techniques such as total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) carry a slightly increased risk.
**EDIT: Dear all, this comment of mine correctly describes Awareness, however, by definition, u/Nitemarex had none.
I misread your comment.
The chair is broken, though.
Unfortunately, the 20 euros won't help us either.
These are statutory warranty claims.
The absolute minimum would be that they take back the broken chair.
This is standard in the eCommerce sector, in addition to the legal requirement.
Please check again whether they at least take back the broken chair.
We will then sell the second chair privately.
We also lose a lot of money.
I already sent you an email that you did not respond to.
The question again.
The order and the invoice state that the goods will be delivered to a room of my choice.
The freight forwarder is company #NAME#.
I just called there.
I was told they only deliver to the front door - due to #PRS_ORG#.
Is that so?
If so, I'll have to cancel the order as I don't know anyone who can carry the heavy furniture up to the first floor.
If I'm not called, what's the point?
I had asked a question
Theater historian Günther Rühle died at the age of 97
He has made a name for himself as a theatre critic and as an artistic director.
Later, he wrote a monumental history of the theater.
On Friday, Günther Rühle died at the age of 97.
The new book is still on the table, freshly printed: "An old man is getting older".
The disturbing diary of a slow farewell to the world, which the theater historian and journalist Günther Rühle kept until April 2021.
And in the middle of reading comes the news that the author has died.
The last sentence in the book reads: "I testify here already my life's thanks."
There are different types of pallets.
One of the most common is the Euro pallet, a standardized wooden pallet that is mainly used as a load carrier in the European area.
They are certified by the European Pallet Association (EPAL)
According to data from Statistics Austria, more than ten million pieces of pallets were produced in Austria in 2020.
The production value was around 79 million euros.
The number of pallets imported into Austria each year is not recorded
New York wins first MLS championship
New York City FC won the Major League Soccer title for the first time.
After the 1:1 in the regular time against the host Portland Timbers, the team from the Eastern Conference won the final in the penalty shoot-out with 4:2.
In the Eastern Conference final, New York had defeated Philadelphia Union, the team of German Kai Wagner.
Rouladen tips and tricks
I got a lot of great tips here last week for the perfect goulash.
I had it for Christmas and it was unbelievably delicious and melt-in-your-mouth!
So thank you again for that :)
Now I'm in the mood and want to cook rouladen for the first time on New Year's Eve.
Tomorrow, I will make a beef stock for it.
Do you have any other tips for me?
Note: I don't have an oven, just a big pot.
What's next?
What about the books or how do I get them back on my #PRS_ORG#?
My English is not so good, but I can manage
It is about a refund of €#NUMBER#
I was already informed by email on 18.01. that the refund had been made.
But to this day, the money has not been paid into my account.
Please check that.
Where there are still Christmas roasts in the Lübeck area
For many people, goose or duck is as much a part of Christmas as the Christmas tree and the presents.
Haven't you got any poultry yet?
Now the time is tight.
We'll tell you where you can still get a Christmas roast in the Lübeck area.
The "drive" of a tube power stage contributes significantly to the warmth and fatness of the guitar amplifier sound.
These characteristics are perfectly implemented by the Valve Reactor circuit.
With the VOLUME, GAIN and MASTER VOLUME controls, you can set the desired level and the amount of distortion in your sounds.
In addition, the VT+ series amplifiers offer a unique POWER LEVEL control that allows you to reduce the sound level without changing the "gain" or distortion.
It was already mentioned earlier that you can even make a power reserve available with the POWER LEVEL controller if it gets unacceptably loud.
Thanks to the POWER LEVEL controller, the full potential of the VT+ series can be used in every situation.
The headphone jack can also be used as a line output.
The signal applied here is processed with a speaker simulation, so that you get an eminent "acoustic" sound impression even when using headphones or when recording directly.
An AUX port can be connected to a CD or MP3 player, so you can jam to your favorite songs.
A tuner function is also on board - so you don't need a separate tuner.
If you also buy a VFS5 foot switch, you can call up the sounds comfortably with your foot, switch the effect blocks on/off and "tap" the tempo of the compatible effects.
This is actually indispensable for live use.
With its new power packs, VOX is taking another step into the future!
But I've seen it like that with other people.
Is there then the possibility to return the lamp?
Because it hangs too low for over a dining table?
So I would like to send them back.
Can you help me with that?
And the chest of drawers?
Will we get another update on the exact delivery date in the coming weeks?
Hello, have you ever sat in a #PRS_ORG# chair
If it doesn't work, I would be happy with a discount or a voucher.
I might find a buyer for the furniture.
Over 1,000 euros for goods I don't need is a bit much.
I have just received my delivery and would like to know if screws were included as part of the delivery.
I would like to mount the #PRS_ORG# mirror (door) on the designated hook.
That's not a satisfactory answer and the wait was not worth it
Do you have a premium customer status?
Iran sees progress in nuclear deal talks
According to Iranian reports, progress is being made in the negotiations on the revival of the international nuclear agreement.
"Both sides are close to agreeing on the issues that are to be on the agenda," Iran's chief negotiator Ali Bagheri told the IRNA news agency on Sunday.
This is a "positive and important development," because at first there was not even agreement on the issues to be negotiated.
The agreement is intended to prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons.
On Thursday, the Vienna talks to revive the agreement were continued after a nearly one-week break.
Representatives of Iran, Germany, Britain, China, France and Russia are taking part in the negotiations.
A US delegation is also present in Vienna, but is only indirectly involved in the negotiations.
Thuringia overtakes Saxony - Free State now federal state with highest Corona incidence
Thuringia has overtaken Saxony and currently has the highest incidence rate in Germany.
As the only federal state, the value is above the 1000 mark.
Thuringia was the only federal state to have a Corona incidence rate above 1,000 on Sunday.
The Robert Koch Institute gave the seven-day value with 1025 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants.
In Saxony, which has always had the highest incidence rate in Germany, this value was 990.5 on Sunday.
On Friday and Saturday, the incidence in Thuringia was slightly lower, but also above the value of 1000.
Within one day, 2242 new infections with the Sars-CoV-2 virus and 16 further deaths in connection with an infection were reported in Thuringia.
On Sunday, 200 people severely ill with Covid-19 were being treated in intensive care units in hospitals.
There may be delays in registration at weekends.
In addition, the health departments have been overloaded for weeks and can hardly keep up with the registration of new cases.
I understand that.
Since the delivery is not until the beginning of March, it may be possible by then.
I have to print it out and stick it on the package and drop it off at the post office, right?
Do I have to click/enter/fill in anything else here?
That is exactly what I want to avoid, which is why I am writing to you.
I would like to take responsibility for the return at my own expense.
An 8 euro return fee is in my eyes an impertinence.
It's time for change
###Hello Bundestag, I am u/StratorDE in the plenary hall in the heart of Europe on a fantastic day!
#Why is the post here?
If you look at the activity of the Bundestag in recent months, you can see one thing: it does not exist.
We've gone into a winter slump and extended the summer doldrums for a few months.
#Where is the problem?
Yes, what was it all about?
For the most part, it's probably just related to the dissatisfaction with how some things have gone here and how we stand in general.
In recent days, it has become increasingly apparent that many people here are still really keen on the Bundestag.
#What we need to change
At this point, the community around the Bundestag is being asked, which wants to keep it alive.
The impetus came from u/edizVEVO, who has become aware of this project in the last few days and found, simply put, a mess.
After some back and forth, several people from the community have come together who are interested in rebuilding the project.
However, I would also like to call on everyone once again to participate, only in this way can this project continue to exist in the future.
We have created a discussion platform in the form of a Discord server, where we can exchange ideas with each other and work out concrete things.
You can join the server via this link.
Goals:
* How should the Bundestag work in the future?
* Which existing orders need to be changed/amended/removed?
* How should we present ourselves to the outside world in the future?
* How will new members be recruited?
* How do we create a fair voting system?
I'm pretty sure I've forgotten some things, but that's not a problem, we have Discord for that.
If you have the time and the will, come to the Discord, work with us and let us decide democratically about the future.
I have ordered a lampshade from you, which is yet to be delivered.
Now I see that the article is too big/clumsy for it and not suitable for my taste.
For this reason, I have already ordered a different suspension from you.
I put it together and then noticed it when I took the soft foam.
I'm very sad about that.
I hope that this is returned and I get a full refund.
This is also quite sad as the #NAME# is much darker than expected.
I have another question: the daily blanket #PRS_ORG#, is it also available in a larger size, such as 240/240 for example?
#PRS_ORG# must be able to guarantee that the faulty cupboard will be collected in a timely manner.
And I ask you to make that happen now.
I don't have suitable packaging, but I will dismantle the cupboard as much as possible for collection - they must clarify with #PRS_ORG# how this can work.
#PRS_ORG# can contact me at any time by phone to arrange a collection date.
Is there an instruction manual for assembly?
How long would I have to get them or decide to return them?
How do you answer the question of why you are vegan?
Today I had a conversation with a colleague that I like.
She herself once lived as a vegetarian for a while, and now she probably eats meat very rarely.
I myself was a vegetarian for several years.
When asked if I had always wanted to be vegan and vegetarianism was a planned interim step, I answered honestly without much thought.
I thought for a long time that I was supporting animal welfare as a vegetarian, but at some point I reflected and understood that I was ultimately also supporting animal cruelty.
Therefore, my decision to become vegan.
At that moment, I had the impression that there was discontent on her side, she then defended vegetarianism and said she knew where her meat came from and that as a vegetarian you reduce animal suffering.
Now I wonder if my answer was too "plump"?
How does she answer the question?
I feel like as a vegan, you're quickly put in a corner and conflicts arise, without you wanting them to.
A harmony-loving vegan says hello (;
It is not a clear-cut case of an exception under § 312d of the German Civil Code.
Your #PRS_ORG# does not exempt you from the legal requirements for distance selling.
I am not at the assigned date that #PRS_ORG# is picking up my return.
Since I can't be there because of a funeral, it can't be changed, unfortunately.
Can I please be assigned an alternative pick-up date?
From 01.02.#NUMBER#, I will be available again continuously.
Lahnsteiner Wehr equipped for water rescue: 45,000 euro grant from the state
Recently, the Rhineland-Palatinate Minister of the Interior, Roger Lewentz, presented a grant of 45,000 euros for the new water rescue vehicle of the Lahnstein volunteer fire brigade to the mayor of Lahnstein, Peter Labonte.
The total cost of the vehicle, which has been in use since November 2020, was €135,000.
A good and important investment in security.
I am pleased that the state of Rhineland-Palatinate is supporting us in this," says Lahnstein's mayor, Peter Labonte.
The equipment wagon is used by the Lahnstein diving unit, one of a total of seven units in Rhineland-Palatinate.
Above and below the water, they perform tasks in water and ice rescue as well as technical assistance.
In Lahnstein, one is permanently dealing with increasing calls: The boom in hotel shipping on the Rhine and Moselle as well as the further increasing use of the Lahn as a leisure river contribute to this.
I bought a book that I could only read 10% of and then the problems started.
I can't open the book.
I have followed your recommendations but synchronised, removed and reloaded the app and NOTHING has worked.
I'm a bit frustrated because the whole thing has already cost me a lot of time and I'm now hoping for help.
Okay, that's how it is.
I would like to order 3 items from the #PRS_ORG# collection for June.
Can I enter a time in the ordering process?

Thanks first of all for standing up for the whole thing here, I have also spent almost a decade in the public service in a similar role, i.e. we were also weapons carriers in the executive, I don't want to go into that any further!
I always find the question of right and left very simplified.
In principle, however, one should say that, of course, the civil servant comes from the liberal to conservative spectrum and not from the revolutionary left, which should be clear to everyone.
Of course, it should also be clear to everyone that people who wear uniforms and carry weapons should also be right of the conservative magic, that these people can of course have a hard time dealing with the lived reality is also clear, because you have of course in addition to the average white, now many Germans with a migration background, women and also homosexuals (and by this I do not mean the over-feminine stereotype queer, because these are in the executive rather less to none but quite normal men and women who you do not notice if they do not tell you) and also on these people I can and must rely, because in doubt they will save your life or put it on the line for you.
But even these fringe groups represent a conservative attitude, in my experience, i.e. they are proud of Germany and feel that they are less and less taken into account by over-the-top left-wing politics, even though this politics supposedly stands up for them or thinks it is doing them a favour, but they simply want to be treated normally.
Returning to the right, since of course the police and armed forces are also a cross-section of society, one will also find extreme right-wingers there, but that they are allowed to openly express their opinion there or even openly plot any state-threatening plans is completely exaggerated in the media and also annoys me.
Of course, it happens that police officers and soldiers, who have often been deployed abroad, start to generalize and say things that are controversial or even politically incorrect due to negative experiences.
It also happens that right-wing like-minded people meet and engage in a lively exchange of ideas.
Nevertheless, I think that this kind of thing is well fought and also countered with political education and enlightenment!
Germany is so deeply international and I think that's a good thing that we can't afford to have real racists and Nazis in our ranks!
Yes, what I don't understand is that I also ordered the other basket on the German side.
Why should it come from England?
When I ordered it, it wasn't sold out.
I ordered in November.
but it was confirmed to me in your order confirmation
It's still about my order that can no longer be delivered.
I was chatting with #NAME# before.
Alternatively, one could have the other #PRS_ORG# basket for #NUMBER# Euro in black delivered to Germany or is this basket also available in Germany.
I can only find you as a partner company.
but at the top edge of the wooden part there are two deep grooves that have been filled with something yellow
and there is a small scratch on the mirror itself
Normal by child?
Hello, I (w32) have been concerned about something for a while.
I am very disciplined and organised at work (I am self-employed, with very little free time), but all my life I have struggled to keep my household permanently clean and tidy.
There are always phases where everything stays the same, and then every now and then it gets to me and I tidy up and clean.
But it's not really "that someone could just drop by spontaneously."
My husband is (unfortunately) not better, it bothers me somewhere but usually the household simply loses against work and disinclination.
The kitchen is cleaned most regularly as we like to cook.
Now to my question, have you managed to get tidier with the baby?
We don't have one yet, but we're working on it, and this question has been on my mind for a while.
Because for me, I have no incentive, it just doesn't bother me so much, as long as no visitors come and, for example, there are always fresh clothes and the kitchen is usable.
Does having a child give you more motivation or do you stay sloppy?
I look forward to your answers.

A career in social work - as someone with an insecure personality disorder?
I did an apprenticeship in software development and have been qualified for about a year now.
Unfortunately, I'm realizing more and more that this profession isn't right for me, which is why I've been thinking for a while about starting over and studying social work.
The problem: I have an insecure (or anxious avoidant) personality disorder (APD).
This means, roughly speaking, that I have no self-esteem and am therefore shy.
I have no problem talking to people on a professional level, but I find it very hard to have casual conversations and I've been told many times that I come across as unapproachable (which I think I've improved on).
Can I become a social worker like this?
I don't want to work as a street worker or in an open youth centre, but rather in, for example, addiction counselling or family support.
But I don't know if the actual day-to-day work is really like what I imagine it to be, and it's hard to find anything about it on the Internet.
The ÄVPS is already causing problems in my job (for me, emotionally), because it drags me down every time there is something to complain about in my code ("screwed up the simplest things again") and it is hard for me to ask more experienced colleagues for help ("I should really know how to do this by now"/"I keep him from working with my stupid questions"/"he must really think I'm less capable" etc.).
I'll probably have problems in every job, but I wanted to mention it here.
But have you already got the sofa back?
Because there was no confirmation for that either.
I'm waiting for an appointment to pick it up
What do they mean by "please give it back"?
When I download a book on the #PRS_ORG# I get the message Your #PRS_ORG# does not authorize this book
Is there a problem with that?
I was chatting with #PRS_ORG#, who asked me if I had received a delivery confirmation for my wardrobe.
The protein (protein) absorbed with the feed is broken down in the bird's gastrointestinal tract into the individual protein building blocks (amino acids) and from these it builds up its own body proteins, which it also needs for feather formation.
The feather formation in nestlings and the feather formation in moulting birds are extremely complex processes and are associated with a particularly high strain on the overall organism of the animal.
Please note that NEKTON-Bio must not be administered during breeding, as it may cause disruptions in the hatching process.
After this course of treatment with NEKTON-Bio, daily vitamin supplementation with NEKTON-S (multivitamin preparation) and NEKTON-MSA (mineral supplement) should be resumed.

1 g NEKTON-Bio in 250 ml of water or 100 g of soft food.
It is only recommended to prepare as much drinking water/soft food as the bird consumes daily and to change the water/food daily.
A painted measuring spoon (included) is equivalent to 1 g of NEKTON-Bio.
In the case of severe feather damage, the double or triple dose of NEKTON-Bio can be given at the beginning, until the start of feather regrowth is visible.
After that, the normal dose is served until the feather regrowth is fully completed.
Storage: NEKTON-Bio should be stored dry, without sunlight, between 15° and 25°C.
Please excuse me, but the chair is sold as an office chair.
How can an office chair break after 9 months?
The warranty claims in Germany are 24 months.
That's really bad service.
Hi, I sent an email on Monday to let you know my order arrived damaged and pictures were attached.
Did you receive this email?
A statement by a community worker in contradiction to the statute
Hello r/LegaladviceGerman,
I have the following problem.
A walnut tree is to be cut down on our property.
So a felling application was submitted to the municipality.
A staff member writes to me that the felling of fruit trees and thus also the walnut is not part of the statute.
However, the walnut is explicitly listed as a tree to be protected in the regulations.
Can I rely on the employee's statement or not?
On the one hand, I have to be able to rely on an expert opinion.
On the other hand, the statute is clear.
Thanks for your answers
We understand that.
Then we will use the new packaging for it.
I have not received a message
Well, then I still have a sofa without use.
Could you offer me a discount or a voucher?
What was more expensive?
Yes, I believe so, but the question is whether I can pay in euros and have the blanket delivered to Germany.
Can you check that?
Breaking news: serious traffic accident in Selb
Recently, a serious traffic accident occurred on the St 2179 between the Selb-Nord junction and Plößberg.
As the current police press release states (14:03), a car came into the oncoming traffic while overtaking.
There are injuries.
Ah, okay, I understand.
Well, thanks again for making it so easy!
Advice and ideas for further professional life
First of all, Merry Christmas to you!
Unfortunately, my Christmas is not very good, because my dear head is currently destroying everything that can be thought of.
Before I go on now ... in short: I need advice and preferably from people who know my situation in some way - so from you.
I'm currently doing the refereeing course as a latecomer.
I originally studied something else and worked in a different field (to remain somewhat anonymous, I won't say anything more specific here).
But then it was all too boring for me and I looked for alternatives that could be more fun for me.
At some point, I ended up in teaching and was sure that this is it - even though the framework conditions are much less flexible than in my previous job, but I didn't care.
I'm now on my third "I'm Googling other job listings."
And it's only been half a year.
With the paintings before that, I always decided to keep going and at least finish the ref, after that I can always change my mind.
But right now, I'm absolutely exhausted.
I've had so little free time in the last month that I'm completely exhausted.
Now it's holiday time, but there's still a lot of work waiting for me.
Before the referee, I always thought I was stress-resistant, but there my weekend was also my weekend and my evening was my evening.
I had a day off.
And the stress at work was irrelevant in those moments.
Now, even family celebrations are too much stress for me.
And then there are these rigid structures that get on my nerves even more.
Basically, it's fun and from the outside, the refereeing is going well, in terms of feedback and so on.
But I'm completely exhausted and wondering how much stress my body can take before it completely shuts down - if it hasn't already.
I wonder if I want to have the rest of my working life like this - especially when I read some of your posts here - or if I should go back to the old area, where I was valued, could take time off when I needed it, and although I found the work a bit boring, I was paid fairly for it and worked as part of a team, and not as a lone fighter like it is most of the time now.
But then I wonder if I'll be back in the same place in a year's time and unhappy.
You can tell that it's all a bit of a mess, but maybe you, as an outsider, have some advice or ideas on how to get out of this situation, where I'm completely done and start to cry at the slightest thought of it.
I'm not going to make decisions now based on emotion. That probably won't lead to anything good.
But perhaps your views will help me to see a little light at the end of the tunnel - or to enjoy Christmas, which is enough for me for now.
Thanks for reading and sorry for the whiny undertone.
I hope my situation is at least a little clearer now.
Since its introduction in 2001, the VOX Valvetronix series has continued to evolve, including the combination of advanced modelling technology with the "Valve Reactor" circuit, which perfectly emulates the behaviour of a tube amplifier.
With the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X amps, we are introducing a brand new modeling engine that is absolutely state-of-the-art in terms of sound.
Thanks to the VET (Virtual Element Technology) technology, which is based on the analysis of the components and the amp circuits, the VTX amplifiers come with an authenticity that is absolutely impressive.
These amps also contain the multi-stage Valvetronix tube preamp.
This is partly based on real analog circuits, because these just do the sound variations and nuances of a tube amplifier better than any simulation.
In addition to this sophisticated circuitry, the VTX amplifiers offer a closed cabinet and a bass reflex system, from which the natural resonances just flow.
With VOX's "Tone Room" software, you can even correct and twist historical facts on a virtual level until the amp and effects sound just like you've always imagined.
The perfect combination of tube sound with modeling technology is primarily due to the VOX Valve Reactor technology introduced in 2001.
Of course, it has been refined several times since then to meet new sound requirements, which in 2010 again led to a performance boost of the VOX Valvetronix series - with more dynamics and numerous and significantly improved amplifier models.
From the handy VT20+ to the VT120+ with two speakers, the new VT+ Valvetronix series has been designed so that all guitarists looking for maximum sound variety will find what they are looking for.
All guitarists dream of the crunch and dynamics of a tube amp: they expect a fat sound, a nuanced reproduction of playing dynamics and string attack, and a quick response.
During an in-depth analysis, the VOX engineers discovered that the output stage in particular determines the tube character of an amplifier and developed the VOX Valve Reactor technology based on this finding.
The Valve Reactor circuit of each VT+ amplifier, which is equipped with a 12AX7 tube, perfectly reproduces the behaviour, subtle nuances and sound character of a tube amplifier.
NBA: Despite 20 points from Wagner: Magic lose to Clippers
The Orlando Magic's losing streak in the NBA continues.
The Wagner brothers can shine - but it is not enough to win against the Los Angeles Clippers.
Despite 20 points from Franz Wagner and seven points from his older brother Moritz, the Magic lost 104-106 to the Los Angeles Clippers on Saturday.
The large main compartment is also adaptable: with three individually placed and foldable Velcro dividers, it is completely tailored to the needs of your photo equipment and is therefore suitable for all types of cameras - from mirrorless system cameras of all sizes to full-frame DSLR cameras.
What ultimately fits in the backpack depends on the size of the camera and the lenses.
A possible loadout would be a DSLR camera with a mounted lens, two to three interchangeable lenses, and a mounted flash.
Larger DSLM cameras like the various models of the Sony a7 series or a Fuji X-T2 still leave room for more lenses.
In addition, you can store a lot of accessories.
And if you have a small DSLM camera (MFT cameras from Olympus, Fujifilm X-A or E-series) you can use the backpack for your equipment and for non-photographic things.
Drone pilots also make an optimal choice with the Everyday Backpack 20L, as the backpack offers enough space for a DJI Mavic Pro including remote control and accessories.
Volcanic eruption on La Palma: probably the longest in history
In the just under three months since the outbreak began, the lava flows on the Canary Island have caused great damage.
Is an end in sight?
With a duration of now 85 days, the volcanic eruption on La Palma has been the longest in the known history of the Spanish Canary Island since Sunday.
Until now, the eruption of the Tehuya volcano in 1585 with 84 days was considered the longest on the Atlantic island off the west coast of Africa.
There are no reliable data on previous eruptions.
Although the activity of the as-yet-unnamed volcano in Cumbre Vieja has decreased somewhat in recent days, volcanologists still did not dare to predict when it could end.
The indicators point to a slowdown.
The best news is that they are stable," said the president of the island council, Mariano Hernández Zapata, to the state TV channel RTVE.
Millions of euros worth of damage
In the nearly three months since the outbreak began, the more than 1000 degree hot lava has destroyed almost 2900 homes and other buildings, as reported by RTVE.
Just under 1,200 hectares were covered by a meter-thick layer of lava.
That is almost 1700 football fields.
More than 7,000 residents had to be evacuated, and the damage is estimated at more than 900 million euros.
Two new land masses, each about 50 hectares in size, were created off the coast by cooled lava.
The banana cultivation, which is of immense importance for the island, was particularly badly affected. About half of the approximately 85,000 inhabitants live directly or indirectly from it, and it was already in crisis before the volcanic eruption.
225 hectares of banana plantations were destroyed, and other areas were severely affected, wrote the newspaper "El País".
Christmas and the gifts
Christmas is just around the corner and especially the children will hardly be able to wait for the heavenly feast.
The many colourful gifts under the Christmas tree, combined with the spiritual atmosphere and the crackling tension, have something alluring about them.
Christmas is one of the few traditional occasions that still hold our increasingly divided society together.
It is all the more important to be aware of the Christmas tradition of giving, so that the gesture of giving, which, according to the French sociologist and ethnologist Marcel Mauss, was a peace-promoting "social contract of nature peoples", can escape the rigid routine and can be brought back to life in the context of this tradition.
How Saint Nicholas became the Christ Child
Strictly speaking, it was the Protestants who linked the Christmas days with gift-giving.
Previously, on St. Nicholas Day, gifts were exchanged in one way or another.
The background to this still popular custom is that Saint Nicholas, as Bishop of Myra, secretly threw gold into the windows of three women one night to save them from a life of sin.
This unconventional way of giving gifts gave rise to the popular German tradition of filling children's boots with gifts.
Protestants objected to this practice, because they reject the idea of mediators between God and man as "idolatry".
For these reasons, they are against the institution.
Martin Luther made St. Nicholas into the Christ Child and thus founded a new tradition.
The focus of gift-giving has therefore shifted to Christmas Eve.
Since most Protestants no longer see such details in such a narrow way, only a few are annoyed that the tradition of Saint Nicholas is still an integral part of the pre-Christmas season, just like the tradition of Saint Martin with Saint Martin's songs and Saint Martin's procession.
Today, one can find everything from socks to coveted luxury watches at the doorstep and under the Christmas tree.
Diversity of traditions in Christian countries
Sources indicate a tradition of gift-giving on Saint Nicholas' Day since the 13th century.
With the Reformation, the day of giving shifted to Christmas Eve.
However, in all Christian countries there is a happy muddle over the question of who brings the children their presents.
In Germany, it depends on the region whether the Christ Child appears on Christmas Eve or Santa Claus, who is essentially a kind of Saint Nicholas, to whom some peculiarities have been assigned over time.
These include his white beard, which has little in common with the more stern Assyrian beard of the historical figure, his sleigh pulled by reindeer, and his preference for the chimney to gain access to the houses.
In the Netherlands, Saint Nicholas remains the central figure on Christmas Day.
In Spain, the Three Wise Men give the gifts, while in Italy it is the witch Befana who is said to have shown them the way to the baby Jesus.
In Scandinavia, sometimes mythical creatures bring the gifts, while in Russia it brought Father Frost some fame.
Here it is not reindeer, but three horses that pull his sleigh as a troika.
In the Czech Republic, the birthplace of the Reformation in the course of the Hussite Wars, the Christ Child is responsible for the delivery of the gifts.
I've been getting this error message for 3 weeks when trying to download a new book, but my account and contact details are up to date:
Please help with troubleshooting, as I
Otherwise buy another e-book #PRS_ORG#.
I have requested a return label for my order #NUMBER# last week and this morning.

Police shoot suspected bank robber near King's Palace
A man armed with a knife was shot dead by police on Saturday near Kensington Palace in London.
Police said callers reported a man had entered a bank and a bookmaker's shop with a gun.
The man fled in a vehicle, which was stopped by officers a short time later, according to authorities.
Shots were fired and the man was hit.
He was pronounced dead at the scene.
The police did not assume a terrorist background.
Several embassies are located in the area around Kensington Palace.
The palace is the official London residence of Prince William, his wife Catherine and their three children.
Other members of the royal family also live there.
Which ones?

The decorative light fits harmoniously into every bed, garden area or rock garden.
The light is simply set up and can be anchored in the ground with 2 ground spikes.
Integrated and powerful 0.4 watt solar module for optimal charging of the built-in battery.
Illumination time max. 10 hours.
- The robust plastic finish is suitable for year-round outdoor use.
In the Hollywood spectacle, it is usually threatening objects from distant galaxies that glow brightly inside.
On the other hand, "Smart Stone" is completely harmless: The sun alone ensures that this solar light shines fascinatingly - optionally in white or coloured light (in six different colour tones).
The edgeless, amorphous design is deliberately chosen: Like a naturally formed large pebble, this modern light object presents itself during the day.
Its organic curves fit into any natural environment - whether on the edge of the terrace, in the lawn or in the stone bed.
It also does well in the company of larger pebbles and boulders, where it can hold its own thanks to its size.
You can save yourself a lot of preparatory work: As a solar light, "Smart Stone" does not need a power supply or batteries.
Place the "beacon" in any sunny place during the day.
Two included ground stakes provide a firm hold if needed.
The matt white plastic shell itself is robust and weatherproof.
Its solar panel discreetly hides "Smart Stone" inside, along with its battery and two LEDs - one for white light, the other for colored light.
The battery is already charging when sunlight falls on the housing.
At dusk, "Smart Stone" lights up automatically; you can choose the colour yourself: there are six attractive light colours to choose from, in addition to daylight white.
The switch-off is also automatic once the battery charge has fallen to a pre-set minimum or it gets light again.
Once the sun shines again, the charging cycle starts all over again the next day.
I've done this multiple times and it doesn't work.
It's a shame, I would have liked to have ordered more from you, but if the voucher is not credited to me, then I will not order from you in principle.
If you change your mind, let me know.
Otherwise, that was the last contact today.
Then please send me the number for the sideboard.

The motor control of the LokSound 5 has been fundamentally improved once again.
A variable PWM frequency of 10kHz to 50kHz ensures super-quiet operation - the typical "humming" is a thing of the past.
The load regulation can now be adapted to difficult cases with up to 10 CVs.
The unique "Autotune" feature allows the decoder to automatically tune to the engine.
The LokSound 5 decoder delivers up to 1.5A of motor current, enough juice even for older motors.

The pill problem
Hello dear women,
I hope I'm doing everything right here, it's actually my first post after a year on reddit.
My problem: I started taking the pill again about five years ago, mainly because I had such incredibly bad pain during my period and terrible PMS before my period.
Now I would like to keep it that way, because I already have to take enough medication for chronic illnesses that I cannot choose.
My main problem, surprisingly not the pain, but my skin.
I had gone from zero to 100 with an explosion of spots in my last two-year break and they were everywhere.
So far, so superficial, but it really got to me and I didn't feel well.
In the two-year break, things have never really normalized.
Maybe someone has some tips to avoid this time.
My cosmetics are already perfume-free and without frills, but maybe there's something that someone can recommend to me.
The gynecologist didn't take me seriously, and I still have to see the dermatologist.
Many thanks to everyone who has read the novel!
Yes, skin is a funny thing.
Had severe neurodermatitis as a child, then a time of rest, then widespread nodular lichen and the acne issue.
I've also tried all sorts of things in the course of my chronic illness, and I've stuck with a low-sugar, low-milk, low-meat mixed diet, because nothing else has worked very well.
It may also be that hormonally, the worm is just in there, but if you have a construction site everywhere like me, you don't want to go looking for anything else that's going wrong.
I had already done all of my colleague's seminars, etc.
Written and now I've lost the conversation and don't know what was replied to my request.
I have to work in between and answer the phone, and all of a sudden everything was gone...
What is there to check if the money was there, I would have seen it
Please check my bank details, maybe there was something wrong
but does it exist in general in large
as it is widely available in black

In the name of the people: Lay people pass judgement
In the courtroom, they sit in everyday clothes on the judge's bench.
But much depends on their verdict, even if they don't wear a robe: Jurors, along with professional judges, determine whether and for how long someone goes behind bars.
Two of them report in conversation with the "Oeffentlichen" from their time at the Bad Kreuznach district court: Sascha Wickert from Boos and Ruth Ertz from Bad Kreuznach are two of a total of 125 lay judges at the district court on John F. Kennedy Street.
Hello, unfortunately I can't get into my customer account.
Could you please send me the invoice for order number #NUMBER# again to the email address above?
Can we dispose of the packaging material?
We have no means to keep them for so long.
We would use the table as they offered it, as if it were ours.
Yes, I had already ordered the same chair in blue in November and also received it. I would therefore now have one in grey because they are so beautiful.
Does the cupboard have to be completely dismantled for collection and return?
And when would the pick-up be?
The 110 kV underground cable will be rebuilt in 2022
The approval for the relocation of the new high-voltage cable in Tann is legally binding.
The plan approval decision of the government of Lower Bavaria clears the way for construction, which is to begin in 2022.
The network operator Bayernwerk announced this.
The approximately seven-kilometre-long underground cable will connect the Tann switching station in the north of the municipality and the existing 110-kilovolt line between Simbach and Pfarrkirchen.
The cable will be connected to a pylon of the overhead line near the village of Edermanning near Reut.
Good morning,
My order from 03.01.21 with the order number #NUMBER# has only arrived in part.
The blue Betsell number #PRS_ORG# with the delivery number #NUMBER# was returned by #PRS_ORG# with the note "Delivery not possible".
The other three packages have arrived, so delivery is definitely possible.
Can you tell me what the next step is?
Have a great start to the week!
You can forget that, I explained that several times yesterday!!
This is a glass chest of drawers and all the sides have burst open, so there is glass everywhere and the box is broken
The chest of drawers is in my apartment and #PRS_ORG# refuses to come into the apartment because of the #PRS_ORG# regulations
This means the chest of drawers cannot be collected as no one is allowed into my home
Thank you for the message
But why only 20 euros?
The original value of this chair was #NUMBER# EUR
No, it's in all books, that's why the request to #PRS_ORG#, as it seems to be a general problem
Ref: Planning lessons (EK)
Hello dear colleagues,
I've been in the Ref since the summer, I enjoy teaching, but I'm currently having a lot of trouble planning my geography lessons in a time-efficient way.
Unfortunately, my school is not very well equipped technically, so I can basically only use the blackboard, the school book and an overhead projector as media.
At school, I can only copy s/w for free (which is annoying for geography).
I just need a lot of time right now to plan my hours.
For example, we are currently working on the topic of geofactors, and for me, every hour is different.
In principle, the methods are always repeated, but on the other hand, I don't want to invest too much time in simple lessons (which I also need for UBs, etc.).
When I plan, I always start with the learning goal (what do I want to achieve) and then think about how I can build it (I usually create a worksheet with texts from books that my school does not have).
We have the book Terra and with most of the tasks in the book I am rather dissatisfied.
That is why the worksheets.
Perhaps a geography teacher can tell me how to work with the book in a time-efficient way.
I would really like that.
I would like to return the #PRS_ORG# from order #NUMBER#.
I have actually already decided on a new one at #PRS_ORG#, but I would like to handle the return as soon as possible.
The trade is worried about the Christmas business due to the 2G regulation.
Only those who have been vaccinated or have recovered are allowed into most shops.
The trade considers this unnecessary and complains of falling sales.
He also has a possible solution ready.
From the perspective of the German Trade Association (HDE), the 2G regulations are ruining the important Christmas business for the retail sector.
Sales of non-essential items have fallen, criticised Stefan Genth, the chief executive of the HDE.
According to a recent survey of 1,100 retailers by the HDE, more than 70 per cent of companies have a negative outlook for the rest of the year.
Many have already written off the Christmas business.
"What should have been the positive highlight of the year is now often a bottomless pit," said Genth.
According to the report, retailers with 2G access restrictions lost nearly a third of their pre-crisis sales in the past week.
Only the food retail sector and the online sector are doing well.
The association called for consequences from the dramatic development.
Shopping with a mask, distance and hygiene concept is a safe affair, said the chief executive.
"2G when shopping does not help us in the fight against the pandemic," he stressed.
The current regulations deterred customers and required a lot of staff.
He called for the nationwide approval of the wristband system.
After that, each customer would only have to be checked once for 2G (vaccinated or recovered) and would have access to all shops with the wristband they received that day.
In addition, in retail - as already in public transport with the 3G rule (vaccinated, recovered or tested) - random checks should be sufficient.
The real estate group Deutsche Euroshop, which specialises in shopping centres, also spoke of a difficult Christmas business.
The frequencies were last at around 75 percent of the pre-Corona level without 2G, and the turnover at around 90 percent.
These figures will now fall in the middle of the all-important Christmas business," said CEO Wilhelm Wellner to "Wirtschaftswoche".
Due to the high personnel and administrative effort, solutions are being sought and approved for the centers.
This includes the so-called wristband solution, in which "visitors, for example, provide their 2G proof at a central point in the centre and then - equipped with a wristband similar to that in a club hotel - can enter all shops undisturbed". dpa
I recently ordered and received the #PRS_ORG#.
The mirror has a scratch and the frame also has a fault, which has been tried to be covered up with a yellow filler.
That looks ugly.
I would like to return the mirror and have already packed it back into the package and sealed it.
How do I proceed with the return now?
The lamp is designed for Dual-Balance, based on new, flat, high-power, high-CRI SMD LEDs.
A modern microprocessor with exceptional capabilities controls the colour temperature and brightness of the lamp.
In addition to adjusting the brightness, there are two standard color temperatures: daylight and artificial light.
It is also possible to manually set and save the colour temperature in the range of 3100 - 5650K.
Use the current settings in the Flash memory.
A special feature of the controller is that it is easy and intuitive to use.
The light produces a very high light output with soft, high-quality light, completely flicker-free.
The 120-degree beam angle, which allows you to light up large areas at a relatively short distance, is excellent.
By the way, also in reporting situations in small rooms or at short distances.
They can adjust the brightness practically without changing the color temperature.
It's a great tool to work with both on set and in the studio.
The optional DMX512 controller allows remote control of the light in television studios or when the light is mounted in hard to reach places.
On the back of the light is the control panel, consisting of buttons and a backlit display.
The display shows the current brightness setting in percent and the current color temperature in Kelvin.
In addition, there is a slot for the NP-F batteries (not included in the scope of delivery)
User memory The memory has up to three panel settings for brightness and color temperature.
To set the individual settings on the memory locations, simply press and hold one of the memory buttons and it's done.
The memory controller stores the current state of the lamp when it is switched off, so that when it is switched on again, the familiar situation is restored - very practical for studio work if, for example, the camera is set to certain colour temperatures.
Working with a battery one of the greatest strengths of the DL3120 functionality comes from the ability to operate with inexpensive NP-F batteries.
These are often already owned by photographers and camera operators (and women) - so you can make use of existing equipment.
The DL3120 can also check if the batteries have enough power before you set it up - it has a built-in battery tester - for each of the two battery compartments a value in the two display screens (the left battery on the upper display, the right on the lower display).
In addition, it is of course possible to continuously supply the headlight with power via the included power supply.
The construction of the headlight is very simple.
They have a 16mm sleeve for attachment, so you can attach them directly to your photo tripod.
The inclination is reliably set using stops on both sides.
It was noted that the mechanical components are also of extremely high quality and are therefore also designed for longevity and hard use.
In addition, a tilt joint is included.
It's great that it also comes with a bag.
This way, you can transport or store the light with all the accessories you might want to buy without any problems.
Shame, I got it as a gift and it's too small :(
"The party we wanted to throw": Frankfurt celebrates after a goal-rich comeback against Leverkusen
What a spectacular reaction from Eintracht Frankfurt.
After 22 minutes, the last two times in a row without a win, the Hessians were supposedly on their way to the next Bundesliga defeat.
But then the SGE turned it around, shot the frustration of a mediocre start to the season from their souls within a good hour and won with 5:2. "It's crazy what the boys did today," jubilated coach Oliver Glasner on DAZN and spoke a "general praise, to each and every one of them who was there".
At first, it looked like another setback for the now ninth-ranked Frankfurt, which is still behind its expectations.
Patrik Schick had put the Leverkusener in the lead with 2:0.
What then happened also impressed the SGE trainer.
"How the players then came back and showed a fantastic performance," continued Glasner.
I'm insanely happy with the performance we've shown and of course with the result.
Even defender Christopher Lenz, who was able to stand on the field for the first time since the fourth game day and his overcome muscle injury, emphasized the morale of his teammates.
"I think our mentality is incredible," said the 27-year-old, looking forward to the result in particular for the spectators.
That was the party we wanted to throw today.
For the upcoming tasks, Glasner wants to keep the focus on himself, but he also sees himself well-positioned in terms of the personnel situation.
It's unusual that we have all the players fit in December, that all the players are in top physical shape.
It's top-class work in our medical department, but the players also live a very professional life.
Now, they want to "move forward step by step and remain humble" and carry out the tasks until the end of the year "at this level".
Next up is an away game at Borussia Mönchengladbach on Wednesday as part of the English week (6.30 p.m., Sky).
I just received an email that my package is being returned to you due to an error on my part.
I tried to call #PRS_ORG# and get it redirected, no chance.
Can it be sent directly to me again or do I have to wait until the money is refunded and place the order again?
For me, that would mean that I would not order again because it has already taken a very long time.
Have you ever sat in a #PRS_ORG# chair?
Dampener for handball women before quarter-final against Spain
Germany's handball women slunk off the court after the humiliation against Denmark with heads down and empty eyes.
To end the main round of the World Cup, the DHB selection suffered a heavy defeat at 16:32 (8:13) in front of 800 spectators in Granollers and must now face the host Spain in the quarter-finals.
"We were much too scared and had too much respect for the opponent," said national coach Henk Groener.
We have to approach Spain differently.
After the first defeat in the tournament, Germany finished the main round group III with 8:2 points as second behind the Danish women (10:0).
It's a shame that we couldn't take the flow with us.
It was a bad game for all of us that we have to erase," said captain Emily Bölk.
In the fight to make it into the semi-finals, a significant increase is needed against the 2019 World Cup runner-up next Tuesday, in order to keep the delicate dream of the first medal since 2007 alive.
The best German thrower in the duel with the three-time Olympic champion Denmark was backcourt player Alina Grijseels with six goals.
"We just weren't there - neither in attack, nor in defence," admitted backcourt player Xenia Smits and called for: "Now we have to look forward quickly."
Not up to it from start to finish
Unlike in the previous five tournament games, the German team was not up to the mark at the start.
Missed shots and technical errors in the attack and gaps in the defense were responsible for a quick 0:4 deficit after seven minutes.
Only goalkeeper Dinah Eckerle was immediately on operating temperature and prevented worse with some saves.
The first goal was scored by the DHB team after 9:30 minutes, when Grijseels successfully completed a quick counterattack.
This was not the hoped-for spark, however.
Against the aggressive defence of the Danish women, the German women could hardly put themselves in the spotlight - and if they did, they mostly failed against the strong Althea Reinhardt in the goal of the Scandinavian women.
So the game was over early at 3:10 after 20 minutes, especially since backcourt player Mia Zschocke was also shown red a little later for a hard foul on her opponent.
But she can take part again in the quarter-finals.
Only in the final phase of the first half did the DHB selection play a little better and at least come within five goals of the break.
The already faint hope of a comeback after the change was gone after seven minutes at 9:19.
Again, the Groener players sinned in all areas and made it easy for the well-prepared opponent, who is one of the medal candidates in the final round.
As a result, the German team could no longer muster a performance boost and left the floor as a clear loser.

How does it work for them?
The title is given in advance, I work as a vaccination doctor in mobile vaccination teams, in which (so far only) the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine is mainly administered in nursing homes.
Since these are soon to be largely completed, I will go to a vaccination centre after that.
I am happy to answer questions without time limit on the organisational and human aspects and also medical questions, as long as they are not personal (e.g. "I take medication X, does it go with the vaccination...").
My area of responsibility includes educating people about the vaccination, determining the indication (the person is entitled to a vaccination according to the Corona vaccination order and has no reasons against it), medical documentation and, if necessary, emergency care in the event of allergic reactions (this has never happened to me).
The vaccination itself can be delegated to qualified personnel, e.g. medical assistants.
In vaccination teams, however, we often do not have them, but "only" (for God's sake, no lack of appreciation!) pharmaceutical-technical assistants for the preparation of the vaccine, who, however, cannot perform vaccinations (are allowed to?), so that I also perform most of the vaccinations myself there.
Serious "Huidlerer" question: Amberger knows the solution
What is a "Huidlerer"?
With this dialect word, sent in by an Amberger, the BR television programme "Wir in Bayern" has caused a lot of thought.
But unlike on many of the previous days, the term in the "Host mi?" series remained a mystery to the callers.
No, it wasn't a "man who is nervous."
And no one who "has to do everything quickly".
This, the people heard from the TV presenter, was completely wrong.
To which the man from Amberg communicated the solution and thus probably also caused astonishment among many Oberpfälzers.
"The Huidlerer," the audience learned, "is a rag with which someone wipes the stove."
Dialect researcher Antony Rowley, who has been questioned as an expert by Bayerisches Fernsehen for years, confirmed this.
With the note that this is a typical Upper Palatinate term, derived somehow from the more well-known dialect word "Houdern".
With which an educational gap was closed - probably also for many who have been living in the Amberg area for a long time.
I haven't been able to buy books for two weeks.
After confirmation, the following error message always appears: oops - something went wrong - try again later.
I have restarted the #PRS_ORG# gel#PRS_ORG#n, connected to the PC, synchronized and repaired.
Nothing helped.
Tire choice for racing bikes - really so puncture-proof?
This morning I woke up full of energy, because I wanted to do at least a little training in preparation for my bike tour next week.
Said and done, and I set off on my racing bike, which I bought on eBay yesterday.
The first 40km were also really nice - but then something happened that lurks in every city center (this time: Thanks Krefeld!).
Glass splinters on the track.
Zack, loud hissing and my rear tire wanted to have nothing more to do with the rest of the track.
Since I had no real opportunity to get a replacement coat and replacement hose due to the day of the week, I had to turn around in a half-bad mood and take the first train home.
It wasn't so bad in terms of mood, maybe it's even better if I practice the tire change again before the bike tour.
Now I'm faced with a question, and I hope you can help me.
As I have a relatively long journey over several days ahead of me, I would be extremely reluctant to have this problem more often.
Now it wasn't really bad, because the old tyres from the previous owner (a very nice old man, who had done 120km until 2pm on the day I came to pick up the bike!) and who had also described them as suboptimal, because he had ridden on rollers for several years with them.
But when I think about the fact that I have to change a tyre after driving 80-90kms, then I'm really in a bad mood, I think :D
Now I was talking to an older man at the platform, who asked me in amazement why I didn't have the Marathon Plus tires; these are supposed to be unpuncturable, after all.
Now, of course, the whole thing sounds very tempting.
But are they really indestructible?
I have little desire to spend 40€/tyre now, only to be disappointed.
I also wonder: I have a 25x622 on my racing bike at the moment.
These are also available (apparently?) with the Marathon Plus tyres, but the majority are already wider.
Is this a problem?
Or would you advise me to use different tyres on a racing bike in general?
The Schwalbe side seems to recommend the Durano DD over my absolute! Laiewissen?
Thanks in advance for the help and best wishes!
Car crashes into tree: driver fatally injured
The 53-year-old had crashed his car into a central island for an unknown reason on the B57 between Rheinberg and Xanten and then ended up in the opposite lane, as the police reported.
There was a head-on collision with the vehicle of a 27-year-old.
The 53-year-old's car was then thrown into a tree and the man was trapped in the car.
The 27-year-old and his 23-year-old passenger were seriously injured in the accident and taken to nearby hospitals.

After the release of our new high-end wideband B 100- 6 OHM, it was only a matter of time before our SOLO series would get new offspring.
The new offspring is called SOLO 15 and looks like the big role models with the B 200 - 6 OHM.
However, this construction proposal includes a suitably designed foot, which is directly included to raise the speaker to the correct listening position.
This has no effect on the acoustics and can therefore be adjusted in length according to the circumstances at home.
The SOLO 15 is very well suited for people for whom the maximum volume plays a rather subordinate role, but who want to achieve an exceptionally high sound level.
A 10 cm speaker is simply not capable of producing such large sound pressure levels almost unfiltered.
However, this does not mean that the SOLO 15 sounds weak.
On the contrary, it walks remarkably maturely and for its size is extremely impressive and accurate.
The SOLO 15 was tuned with a slight high-frequency rise.
This is common in broadband to optimise the rapidly increasing bundling at high frequencies.
The SOLO 15 is exactly aimed at the listening position and impresses with a very clear and fine sound.
Slightly turned outwards, the high-frequency range can be reduced and the sound image can be made warmer.
Thanks to the point sound source, the location of the individual components of a piece of music in the optimal stereo triangle is razor sharp and surprisingly precise.
The reference-worthy extremely low mechanical losses of the B 100 - 6 OHM result in a dynamics that is hard to match.
The SOLO 15 not only complements our SOLO series, but also expands it in terms of resolution and accuracy.
As with all our kits, it is a good idea to think about the final look of the speaker at the start, so that any changes can be made during construction.
If you want to veneer the case, for example, the lowering of the loudspeaker must be adjusted accordingly, since the veneer adds material.
After all the plates have been cut (e.g. in the hardware store), one should first drill an 8 mm hole in the floor plate at the appropriate place, so that the cable can be passed through there later without any problems.
Now, with the help of a top milling machine, the speaker opening in the front is followed, so that the B 100 - 6 OHM can later be installed flush.
On the back, this opening should be provided with a 45° chamfer to make the opening area of the loudspeaker chassis inside as large as possible.
The four connection points of the B 100 - 6 OHM are interrupted in the phase, as shown in the image "Detail Phase".
After that, you start with the actual construction of the box and place one of the two side walls on a flat surface in front of you.
The back, the lid, the front and the floor are now glued onto this.
The three stiffeners should also be used and glued.
The stiffeners themselves can vary in material thickness as needed, for example if you want to use ready-made strips from the hardware store instead of making them yourself from 16 mm MDF.
In the next step, the second page is attached.
Then follow all the plates of the foot, i.e. the two sides, as well as the front.
Using a suitable hole saw or Forstner drill bit makes it easier to attach the openings of the bass reflex tube, as well as the connection terminal on the back wall.
Afterwards, a round cutter is used to round off all the edges of the actual box.
The top of the foot plate can also be rounded off with it.
Afterwards, the foot plate is firmly glued to the foot of the housing and additionally screwed on with long wood screws.
The next step is to mark and pre-drill (2.5 mm drill bit) the screw holes for the speaker chassis and the connection terminal.
After the case has been cleaned of wood dust (vacuuming/blowing out), one starts with the laying of the cable.
This is most easily achieved through the 35 mm bass reflex opening in the rear wall.
To do this, you push the entire, uncut cable piece by piece through the 8 mm hole in the foot to the terminal opening and let it protrude there by about 30 cm.
In the upper part of the case, the cable is led to the speaker opening and left to hang loosely there as well.
The frequency switch is then prepared and used.
The construction plan of the frequency switch, as well as the corresponding connection plan, can be found in the following document: Assembly instructions for the Solo 15 switch.
Once the frequency changer is installed and the connection terminal is screwed in, the sealing of the 8 mm cable opening inside the box, which is not yet completely closed, follows.
With the 35mm bASSREFLEX opening and some skill, you can drop hot glue onto the opening and seal it.
By opening the B 100 - 6 OHM and using a small lamp, the seal can be checked accordingly.
Now follows the eradication, according to the description.
The B 100 - 6 OHM is then connected and screwed in place with the appropriate screws.
The polarity plays an important role here, so that the positive lead (marked cable) must be soldered to the positive pole of the loudspeaker (larger contact).
Finally, the bass reflex tube is cut to the specified length of 28 mm (total length of the tube) and inserted.
To combat this, a mat of the damping material is cut in two and loosely distributed in the case.
The opening around the bass reflex channel should be kept clear.
Can I place an order now and have it delivered in early June?
> Hello everyone,
> Finally, we can announce that we will also hold the OSCAST this year!
> Unfortunately, for known reasons, it is not possible for us to get more than four people into the studio, which has meant a higher planning effort and explains the short notice of the announcement.
BUT: There will be at least three people on the call, so we'll be watching the 2021 Oscars with at least 7 beans in the stream, and hopefully thousands of you!
> We do our best to avoid delays or other problems.
But hey, it's still a pandemic - we'll do our best to make the Oscars as entertaining as possible.
> It will start at about 0:30.
Get your drinks cold, plan some good food, and get ready for a long, but very interesting night.
