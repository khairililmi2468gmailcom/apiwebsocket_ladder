The goods cost less than 20 euros.
The fee is equal to 40% of the value of the goods.
I'm a #PRS_ORG# big customer, so it's not a problem for me.
I just need a number or instructions on what I should include with the package so that it can be tracked by you as a return.
I ordered the #PRS_ORG# a few days ago... for 249€.
Today it costs 179€.
I find that very annoying, to be honest.
Do I need to cancel the order and re-order for the better price or is there another way to get a credit?
I also find that children should not be expected to take on a parental role for their younger siblings.
However, I find that it is also good for older siblings to take care of the little ones in moderation.
Sometimes look, sometimes help, sometimes bring the bottle, etc.
So they learn responsibility, help in the family and are involved.
As long as they can still be children themselves, I don't see a problem.
If your K1 is able to occupy himself for a short time and it's okay with him, that's good.
You can best judge whether it is suitable for your children.
It's not as if he's supposed to wrap K2 and accompany him for hours while he falls asleep.
Legally speaking, it is probably dubious.
Perhaps that is why the statement of the psychologist comes from.
Because if something were to happen like a fire, break-in, earthquake, alien invasion etc. it would actually be too much responsibility for K1 to take care of K2.
Whether this is a risk you want to take, is of course up to you ;)
Please help me find the title of a book again!
I remember reading a crime/thriller a few years ago and although I can remember almost the entire plot, the title just won't come to me. Maybe someone here knows something about it...
The story was about fear and how to deal with it.
At the beginning of the story, a zookeeper commits suicide by covering himself in food and walking into the enclosure of his big cats.
The case is taken on by a policewoman who, after a short investigation, comes across his therapist, who runs a clinic where he treats anxious patients.
The Commissioner has a little niece who also has a fear (of fire) and ends up with this therapist.
There are more suicides, and there is another protagonist - a photographer who is anonymously commissioned to go to the scene of each suicide and document it, and post the photos on the internet.
In the end it turns out that this therapist is running an underground therapy group where patients are implanted with a chip that suppresses a fear center in the brain, and the patients ultimately face their fear in the most extreme way.
(A woman jumps out of a window and another deliberately drives herself to death)
This is called "the fight" in the book.
In the end, there is a big showdown in the hospital that had something to do with a fire.
That is the rough plot, I'm pretty sure the book was originally written by a French author.
If anyone knows of this action or can even tell me the title of the book, I would be very pleased.
Oh dear, I don't have the password for the Wi-Fi available.
I'll have to contact my husband first.
This can take a while, though.
What steps do I need to take afterwards?
Is it also possible to get the price difference refunded?
4-year-old child, splinter under the thumbnail
Child, four years old, has wood splinters over the entire length under the thumb nail (outside).
I tried to pull him out with a pair of tweezers.
Very difficult to pin down.
Didn't work and it hurt.
Now the child hysterically reacts when we try.
No chance anymore.
Tomorrow I'll go to the doctor.

The LokSound 5 is the most important member of the LokSound family.
By combining the digital decoder and sound module on a circuit board, we achieve dimensions of only 30mm x15.5mm and can thus be installed in almost every H0 and 0 gauge locomotive.
LokSound 5 decoders are available with all common interfaces and always come with an 11x15mm "sugar cube" speaker and a sound capsule kit.
Like all family members, the LokSound5 is a true multi-protocol decoder.
It supports the DCC data format as well as Motorola®, Selectrix® and M4.
14 to 128 speed steps are as natural in the DCC format as 2- and 4-digit addresses and up to 32 functions.
Thanks to RailComPlus® the decoders automatically register with a suitable digital central unit.
It supports all DCC programming modes and thanks to RailCom® the CV values can be read from the main track with suitable central units.
For central stations that can only program CVs from 1-255 there are helper registers.
Motorola® users benefit from up to 28 steps at 255 addresses.
Three additional Motorola addresses enable the triggering of 16 functions.
A built-in programming mode also makes reprogramming possible with the venerable Control Unit 6021.
The M4 protocol allows for automatic registration to mfx®-compatible central units.
The LokSound 5 decoder recognises Märklin® brake lines as well as ZIMO® HLU brake commands or the Lenz® ABC system.
Braking with DCC brake blocks or with direct current is also possible.
In addition, it also stops at a Selectrix® brake diode.
An ABC pendulum train automatic allows automatic pendulum between two railway stations.
The LokSound 5 decoder can be used on analog DC and AC layouts.

Due to Omicron: Johnson wants to push for booster vaccinations
New Omikron cases are causing concern for politicians and scientists in the UK.
All eligible adults in England will therefore receive a vaccination offer by New Year's Day.
London - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to speed up the Corona booster vaccinations in the face of rapidly increasing Omikron numbers more quickly than previously aimed for.
Every adult in England should have the opportunity to receive a booster dose by the end of the year, provided at least three months have passed since their second dose, Johnson said in a pre-recorded video message to his fellow countrymen on Sunday evening.
So far, the target date was the end of January.
The UK Government will also provide additional support to speed up vaccination campaigns in the regions of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
In the face of the Omicron variant, one is facing an emergency, which is why it is urgently necessary to strengthen the protection from vaccination, said Johnson.
The good news is that the level of protection can be increased again with a third vaccine dose.
"Get boosted now!" Johnson said.
A further 1,239 Omicron cases were recorded in the UK on Sunday, taking the total to 3,137.
Compared to the previous day, this was an increase of a hefty 65 percent. dpa
Will the full amount be refunded from the purchase price upon pickup?
I think everyone should introduce themselves with pronouns
I sent off an application.
Today, the invitation to talk came by email.
I want to respond to the email.
Unfortunately, the name is not "Peter", but a slightly more complicated name.
I Googled him and depending on where he's from culturally, it's either a man or a woman.
"I have no idea how to write the email now.
Can someone please help me?
**I'm a foreigner and I don't want to step on anyone's toes either.
Conclusion: Everyone should introduce themselves with pronouns.
I have a total of 5 books on it.
Four of them go.
The only one I bought today doesn't work
Clearly, the chair had an undisclosed fault at the time of sale.
How can such a cushion damage otherwise occur after 9 months?
First attempt on #PRS_ORG#.
However, this has been the case for about
No more than 14 days.
Therefore, I have always bought the last books via the website and then read them on the #PRS_ORG#.
I bought 6 #PRS_ORG# and wanted to buy 8.
But there were none left.
Now they are available again and I would like you to please add 2 chairs to my order and bill me for them.
[CW] The feeling when I can't help.
Content warning: I will be writing about domestic violence in some detail here.
I just need to get something off my chest.
I (21) come into contact with the victims (and perpetrators) of domestic violence more often for professional reasons.
A topic that is really gnawing at me is that many victims don't allow themselves to be helped or think that we can't help them.
I am well aware that we cannot do everything and it is not perfect.
But there are fewer things in my profession that move me more than when I can't do anything in such situations.
I see the bruises, the blood, the desperate eyes...
But even in a conversation behind closed doors, with the perpetrator far out of sight and earshot, I cannot reach everyone.
I do not know what the reason is, perhaps it is fear, fear of revenge, fear of leaving the familiar social environment, fear of taking the children away from it.
What I want to make clear to everyone, sometimes even very close to tears, is that everyone deserves to be able to live without violence.
I want all women to know that they don't have to accept violence.
I often wish I could help in any way... but I know I can't.
However, it will never get easier.
Please, always remember that you are worth living without violence, that is so incredibly important.
"Arcane" on Netflix: What does the series about "League of Legends" have to offer?
A lot of fantasy, a lot of complicated names, a breathtaking presentation: "Arcane", the series from the "League of Legends" computer game universe, was recently released on Netflix.
Why are we looking forward to the already announced two seasons?
Basketball-Bundesliga: Derby disaster for the MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg at the Merlins Crailsheim
At least on youngster Johannes Patrick, you could rely on.
Nothing again: For the second time in less than three months, the Giants lost in Crailsheim - and how!
Before the game, Ludwigsburg's coach John Patrick, when looking back on the cup defeat in early October against the Hakro Merlins Crailsheim, said: "We still have some anger in our bellies."
After the game, however, it did not subside - but rather increased in view of the 61:72 (28:38) defeat in the Basketball Bundesliga.
Where more than the bare result was disappointing was the manner of the performance.
As an example, a statistic is mentioned, which expresses the entire dilemma: The three-point rate was only 13 percent, 4 hits (all from the young Johannes Patrick) at a whopping 31 attempts - any questions?
John Patrick gave the answer: "After the victory in Tenerife, we were just not focused enough and did not implement what we had trained for".
To move the ball.
Sebastian Gleim's opposite number reacted differently: "It was a great game to win against Ludwigsburg for the second time," said the happy coach.
"It felt like 10,000 people were there."
On Saturday, only 750 visitors were allowed in the Hohenlohe Arena, but they got their money's worth.
Not least due to BBL top scorer T.J. Shorts, who marked 22 points and led the game for his team.
"The best playmaker I've ever trained," Gleim praised.
While in Patrick's team even the top players like Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7) failed across the board.
Only in the last quarter (22:15) did the Giants prevent a total disaster and came within eight points, after they had already been behind 39:59.
In addition to Johannes Patrick, Justin Simon scored twelve points.
Fortunately, there's not much time to bicker.
Already on Wednesday (7 p.m.), the Giants will receive the Skyliners Frankfurt, in front of a maximum of 750 spectators in Ludwigsburg.
We used to have a different email address, but I changed it.
Yes, I signed up a few months ago.
Unfortunately, all warranty claims were rejected.
We have sought legal advice again and have written to them again because of this.
We originally signed up half a year ago.
Always like a duck out of water: Max Raabe turns 59
He is able to captivate his audience with new interpretations of songs from the 1920s and 1930s.
Currently, he is on tour with the programme "Guten Tag, liebes Glück" - if he is allowed to perform.
Actually, Max Raabe wanted to celebrate his birthday on the stage in Leipzig this Sunday.
But nothing comes of it.
The planned concert has been moved to May 2022 - "at the request of the authorities", in order to contain the coronavirus.
Other planned performances in the Advent season must also be cancelled for the time being, as it says on the website of the singer, who turns 59 today, and his musicians (www.palast-orchester.de).
From January onwards, the artists then want to make up for the dates already postponed due to the pandemic in 2020.
Born on 12 December 1962 in Lünen in North Rhine-Westphalia, Max Raabe has been singing a lot and with pleasure since he was a youth.
In Berlin, he studied opera singing, in 1986 he founded the Palast Orchestra together with fellow students.
Since then, the baritone has established himself with his repertoire of schlager and chansons in the style of the Comedian Harmonists.
He was awarded many prizes.
His live album from the "MTV Unplugged" series (2019) reached - just like his successful album "Für Frauen ist das kein Problem" (2013) - second place in the charts.
He has made it from the niche to the mainstream.
Always elegantly dressed, with his blonde hair slicked back and mindful of etiquette, Max Raabe is an integral part of the current German-speaking music scene.
Since 2020, he has been on tour with the program "Guten Tag, liebes Glück". dpa
Hello #NAME#, is it also possible to get a small sample of the furniture wood in advance?
It can be added to existing furniture and this way we could check beforehand if it matches in colour
It still does not work, I can only long for the cover page, but cannot turn the pages.
Federal Minister of Construction Klara Geywitz: Expropriation does not create new housing
The new Federal Minister of Construction Klara Geywitz (SPD) has spoken out against the expropriation of large housing corporations, as demanded in a referendum in Berlin.
"Expropriation does not create a single new apartment, it only changes the ownership structure," said Geywitz in an interview with the "Tagesspiegel" (Sunday).
My aim is to give tenants security that their rent will remain affordable for the next few years.
A colourful mix of, for example, private landlords, co-operatives or housing companies, by the way, is the best protection against the formation of a monopoly.
In Berlin, the coalition of SPD, Greens, and Left Party will deploy an expert commission on how to deal with the result of the referendum.
However, if the situation does not ease, Geywitz did not rule out talks with the FDP in the Ampel coalition over further tightening of rental law.
The coalition agreement envisages a rent cap until 2029, a limitation of rent increases in tight housing markets and the expansion of the rent index.
I will speak with the Justice Minister to implement it as quickly as possible.
If the rental market does not ease up, "we will talk to our coalition partners about further steps," stressed the SPD politician.
Hello, I wanted to order something and after a few days I noticed that I have forgotten the last step in payment.
Unfortunately, the product is no longer available.
Do they know when it will be back in stock?
Or if it will ever come back at all?

That is an absolute cheek
At least 100 people killed by tornadoes in Kentucky
A devastating storm system has swept numerous tornadoes through the United States.
Kentucky alone could have more than 100 fatalities.
The images from there are reminiscent of a war zone.
In the night to Saturday, several tornadoes in the USA caused severe destruction and may have claimed up to 100 human lives.
The storms left a roughly 320-kilometer-long swath of destruction, especially in the state of Kentucky.
Its governor, Andy Beshear, said after a visit to the disaster zone that everything was gone where the tornado had ripped through.
Houses, shops, government buildings - just gone.
Parts of industrial facilities, roofs are in the trees.
It is hard to imagine that this is even possible.
He expects up to 100 deaths in the state of Kentucky alone, and the official figures are rising by the hour.
Hello, I just saw that they are sold out of display case #NAME#.
That's very sad.
Is it still being produced?
Or has it been completely taken out of the range?
Is it possible to order this showcase in another country?
When will you report?
If the delivery can't be made to my apartment, I have to cancel the order!
I understand this, but can I now order the ceiling and have it delivered to Germany, which is in the shopping cart?
I had returned an article via the contact form or submitted a return and wanted to ask if it arrived or was being processed, as I had not yet received confirmation.
Firms pay vaccination bonuses, change slogans
While the federal government continues to reject proposals for a vaccination incentive, companies in Austria have taken the initiative and are offering their employees financial incentives to get vaccinated.
In doing so, they are in line with the social partners ÖGB and the Chamber of Commerce, who today called for financial incentives for vaccination.
Also, the transformation of advertising slogans into vaccination calls - following the German example - is supposed to increase the willingness to get Corona vaccinations.
He has switched to a company that he has gossiped about.
That doesn't make his situation any better than yours.
Wait and drink tea.
It's been a year.
He has obviously not stayed at his old place and has been looking for something else.
You can do that, too.
And that he didn't like you back then: eh, doesn't matter.
After all, he didn't like his job either.
There are too many variables.
Please process the cancellation.
This will then become legally relevant.
I take a screenshot.

Help with first own campaign
Cheers, Boron!
I am currently running the adventure Over the Greifenpass for a group of 4 friends and I want to seamlessly transition my heroes into a campaign written specifically for the players.
We are playing DSA 5.
The big arc is done, the villains and their motivations written, the individual acts thought out and now I'm in the process of writing the opening adventure and I'm already stumbling over my own feet with the first encounter.
The premise is that the heroes are to deliver a wagon of grain from Gratenfels to a small village near Thuran Lake.
That's where the further action is supposed to develop.
Some miles from the village, a group of goblins is said to lie in wait for the hero, luring them into an ambush.
I want to give the player characters the ability to solve the confrontation in different ways: Persuading, Acting, Threatening, Anticipating the danger, or whatever the players come up with.
Group size: 8 common goblins, 2 with spears, 6 with bows and sabers
If not noticed, the Goblins wait for the heroes in a hollow path and flank the wagon with three on each side armed with bows, while two stop the wagon with spears.
Should it come to a fight and the heroes lose, I have two solutions
1. The heroes are all knocked unconscious and later found and healed by the village schoolmaster's son, a half-elf.
The cart is of course gone.
2. Should a defeat be inevitable, this half-elf steps in with two of his servants to come to the heroes' aid in battle.
The cart is still there, everything is great.
How appropriate do you find Deus ex Machina for Solution 2?
Is the encounter too much of an introduction to the adventure?
The group of Goblins will later play a crucial role, so they are not just cannon fodder.
EDIT: wow, I didn't expect so many replies, especially not so many great suggestions and tips.
I'm sure I'll take a lot of your ideas on board, and I have more confidence in my narratives now, too.
I took the lamp apart again.
And again stuck together.
Unfortunately, it still isn't working.
That's why I would still like to send them back
Can you then send the returns, then I can pack the lamp and bring it to #PRS_ORG#.

Will everything be collected again, or just the storage part?
I'm fed up with Sky Sports F1
Hello, dear F1 fans, over the course of the season, the quality on German Sky has deteriorated more and more, so I wanted to vent a bit with this post.
First of all, the broadcast was interrupted today in the middle of the F2 race to start the F1 pre-coverage on time.
Granted, the delayed start and the crash at the start meant that the schedule was way behind schedule, but it would still have been possible to show the last (planned) ten minutes, as well as the championship decision (!).
However, it seems that, for legal reasons, the F1 has priority, so everything else has to be restricted, so Sky DE probably had no choice.
Nevertheless, it is stupid, since Sky UK broadcast the race to the end.
Nonetheless, a little praise: the commentator Olivier Zwartyes accompanied the difficult situation surrounding the serious accident well.
Then there was once again rule ignorance among the commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, as both of them did not know that one is allowed to change tires under a red flag.
Although this situation has already arisen in Imola, Baku and Silverstone this year, both only came to the conclusion that Verstappen was allowed to change his tyres when there were corresponding radio messages on this subject to Hamilton.
Both commentators at Sky UK and RTL knew immediately that there was this possibility for Verstappen.
I believe that such elementary rules should simply be known if one comments on the F1 on a pay-TV channel.
It is also not the first time that guessing what is now allowed or mandatory according to the rules is allowed or required, both have just constant uncertainty when it comes to rules.
Generally, I don't like the artificial commenting style of Roos, but I admit that it's a matter of taste.
But I think even Heiko Wasser from RTL is better than that.
In addition to this, there are constant jokes that make both of them seem unprofessional, such as ordering coffee from the (equally clueless) reporter Peter Hardenacke or "UuuuuHD" from Ralf Schumacher.
The latter in particular brings a lot of unrest to the comment, which he apparently does not take seriously.
Not least, the advertisements are just getting out of hand at Sky. In the run-off round, Sky is the only station that goes into advertising, as one can hear on F1TV, where only the German sound track without commentary has to make do directly after the race.
Neither ServusTV nor ORF are doing that.
These two channels also make less adverts during training than Sky, and as free-to-air channels.
It is true that one must praise Glock and Baumgartner for their work, but that alone does not make me turn a blind eye to the drawbacks.
The rest of the Sky Sports F1 programme is also very thin and full of repeats.
Overall, Sky is really the worst German-speaking channel that broadcasts the F1.
Without irony, RTL is doing a better job with the four races they are still allowed to broadcast.
So, at least, the great F1 season is a lot less fun than it would be with a reasonable broadcaster.
I would like to hear your opinion.
Here: #PRS_ORG# pendant light, brass and multi-coloured glass x 1
Hi, I have an article that was supposed to be delivered last week and it still hasn't been delivered.
I've messaged the chat twice and haven't heard anything.
The first lady told me it was going to go out on Monday, the second lady told me yesterday she was going to check and send an email and she never responded.
Hello, I ordered two #PRS_ORG# on 12/12/19.
One of them has already shown a defect after a relatively short time (the material has a hole in the front part of the chair).
I ask for your support.
Air pumps are great for adding extra oxygen to an aquarium.
It is also possible to operate a filtration system with an air lift.
This series is offered by us in three variants.
Check the table at the end of the offer.
There, you can see the services in comparison.
If the pumps are strong enough, you can operate entire plants with them.
If you have a large aquarium, pumps with 2 or more outlets are suitable, so that you can connect multiple outlets.
The MK series has one, two, or four outlets depending on the model, but a fan pump is also suitable for creating an accent in the aquarium, e.g. with an air curtain (available from us in the shop) or with a decoration that turns the air bubbles into a function.
Here, a treasure chest, shell or something similar would be mentioned.
The MK series has a special, sound-insulated construction and thus ensures low operating noise.
The installation is very easy.
The fan pump is connected to a drain or similar via a 4/6 mm air hose...and then it can get started.
The fan pump should be the same or higher than the water level and mounted externally.
If the fan pump is lower than the water level, you should install a check valve between them.
Simply cut the air hose and place the valve in between.
This would prevent the water from running backwards, which would cause the water from the pool to run through the pump...
If the fan pump is installed outdoors, it should be covered like other air pumps and protected from moisture
MK series pumps are pure power packs that require little energy
Even though we state a processing time of 3 days here on eBay, we pack daily and the packages are also collected daily here.
If everything is going well on the way, it goes very quickly.
We just want to prevent anyone from being upset, just because it took a little bit longer.
It's as if everyone doesn't understand all the employees who also work in the shipping industry...of course, Corona doesn't stop here.
Please don't give a bad rating just because the delivery is delayed, this is solely due to the package services.
Of course, we like to complain about these services, even though we're saying right now...they're having a really hard time
This is also very different from region to region.
Don't be angry with anyone, stay healthy and we all hope that there will be better times again.
How long does it take to order the yellow ones with and without armrests?
Can you also order the legs in light here?
Amazon founder Bezos is sending an astronaut daughter and moderator into space
The daughter of the first American in space, a TV presenter and four other passengers took a short trip into space.
On Saturday, they were transported by the New Shepard rocket system from the company Blue Origin founded by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.
The start and landing of the approximately ten-minute flight took place in the west of the US state of Texas.
Under a brilliant blue sky, Bezos personally greeted the freshly-minted astronauts upon their return.
"Welcome back," said Bezos, dressed in a blue space suit, as he opened the hatch to the capsule.
Under the applause of friends, family members and employees of Blue Origin, the six passengers one by one climbed out and hugged the Amazon founder.
According to Blue Origin, they were in the air for 10 minutes and 13 seconds and reached a height of 107 kilometers.
The 74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of the 1961 NASA astronaut Alan Shepard (1923-1998), after whom the Blue Origin rocket system is named, and the 50-year-old TV host Michael Strahan were guests of honor of the company, the other four passengers had paid for their tickets: Space engineer Dylan Taylor, investor Evan Dick, technology entrepreneur Lane Bess, and his son Cameron.
Blue Origin did not disclose how much each person paid for their ticket.
After the short flight, Laura Shepard Churchley remembered her father's mission.
He had to work hard and do everything himself during his missions.
She just went along for the ride, said the 74-year-old with a laugh.
Michael Strahan also spoke enthusiastically.
The moderator said he would like to return to space as soon as possible.
"New Shepard" flies up to 100 kilometers in height
The New Shepard rocket system flies mostly autonomously.
The capsule, which was detached from the rocket during the flight, reached an altitude of about 100 kilometers above the earth, experiencing weightlessness for a time, before the reusable object was slowed down by large parachutes and landed again.
The International Aeronautical Federation and many other experts see 100 kilometers above the Earth as the boundary to space, but there is no binding international regulation.
It was already the third manned all-out flight of Blue Origin: On the first in July, Amazon founder Bezos himself was on board, together with his brother Mark, an 82-year-old former US pilot and an 18-year-old Dutchman.
At the second one in October, the 90-year-old Canadian actor William Shatner was present, who became world famous with his role as "Captain Kirk" in "Star Trek", as well as the former Nasa engineer Chris Boshuizen, the entrepreneur Glen de Vries and the deputy head of Blue Origin, Audrey Powers.
Critics have accused Bezos and Blue Origin of pushing ahead with the space tourism business largely without scientific research interests for the benefit of humanity and without regard for the climate.
At the press of a button, you can easily choose whether your "Smart Stone" will light up permanently in one colour or play through its entire colour spectrum.
When set to colour change, the light stone retains a light colour for around one minute before gently transitioning to the next decorative tone.
The solid construction of the "Smart Stone" light is year-round outdoor-proof.
In snowy surroundings, its light even looks particularly good – only with a shortened light duration is to be expected, as soon as the days become shorter.
In winter, please make sure that no snow affects the function of the solar module.
"Smart Stone" uses a NiMh battery in the common mignon ("AA") format, which can be easily replaced if necessary.
A suitable replacement battery can be obtained through our webshop, allowing you to further extend the life of your decorative light.

Someone who works in or has studied biochemistry
I'm currently studying biochemistry in the first semester and I actually find the subject itself pretty interesting, and I don't mind being in the lab either (I've already completed the inorganic chemistry practicum).
Of course, I had also looked into career prospects before I started my studies, but at the time I also thought that I would definitely like to study until the doctorate.
At the moment, however, I have doubts, especially the job prospects are weighing heavily on me.
On the one hand (Studycheck, etc.), one always hears about great career opportunities and that the profession is very much in demand, but on the other hand, one always hears about unemployed biologists and incredibly low-paying jobs.
Therefore, I would really like to know:
1) What are you currently working on?
2) Are you happy with your work/salary?
3) What did you study/ what training did you do?
4) Would you do it all over again?
Thank you for your answers!
I'm currently really uncertain and am thinking of perhaps dropping out of university in 2022 and doing an apprenticeship as an IT specialist.
If you have any experiences, feel free to share them too :)
Extra stress before the holidays & public holiday weekends
It came up for me last week.
I had to use my long weekend now to relax from it.
That's why it is only now that a post is being added.
Not only before big holidays, such as the Christmas holidays, there is a lot of stress in our business.
As it seems, there are also holidays plus bridge days.
It was like this: Last week was the Feast of the Assumption, which is called "Auffahrt" in Switzerland.
On Friday, most people and businesses make a bridge day, which is semi-official.
Last week, therefore, a long 4-day weekend was in the offing.
So, what happened last week?
Stress everywhere.
There were so many emails that had to be sent out before the long weekend, here an order, there an order, everything *absolutely* before the long weekend.
Because... yes, because?
Because "next week then" sounds like so much time has passed and that must not be the case?
Or because people really want to get as much done in a shortened week as they would in a normal one?
Not only was I stressed on Wednesday, but I was also really annoyed.
What is the point of this self-imprisonment because of holidays?
Why do we even have holidays if we are not allowed to enjoy them properly?!
The stress didn't come from above, the colleagues were all like that on their own.
My question is simply: are we Swiss the only ones like this?
Is this our reformed-evangelical way?
Or do you know it in the north as well?
Yvonne Catterfeld looking forward to Christmas in Thuringia
Yvonne Catterfeld (42) is looking forward to Christmas in her home in Thuringia - but she doesn't have any gifts yet.
"The beautiful thing is, even if there is no snow in Erfurt, you can just drive to Ilmenau in the Thuringian Forest", said the actress and singer at Hit Radio FFH.
She would get into the spirit of the festival by baking cookies and doing crafts with her son.
"I love it," said Catterfeld.
However, until the contemplative days, she still has some things to do: "For the first time I don't have any gifts yet, I have to finally get going now".
NEKTON-Bio supports a smooth moult and feather regrowth.
NEKTON-Bio contains all essential vitamins, amino acids, minerals, trace elements and 200,000 µg of biotin/kg.
NEKTON-Bio makes the bird's plumage smooth and shiny.
The majority of the feather damage that occurs in bird-keeping is solely due to nutritional errors.
As the plumage consists of a protein-rich substance, a particularly rich and well-balanced protein diet for the bird is a prerequisite for the formation of a flawless plumage.
For a functioning metabolism, the daily diet must contain enough vitamins, minerals and trace elements.
A large proportion of animal losses that occur during the moult are due to inadequate or unbalanced protein intake and/or inadequate supply of vitamins and minerals.
In the composition of NEKTON-Bio, the unfavourable ratio of amino acids in most plant-based feeds is explicitly taken into account and balanced.
While using NEKTON-Bio, no other vitamin supplement should be administered.
NEKTON-Bio is water-soluble in cold water and can be easily administered via drinking water or soft food.
Thank you, I found it
Unfortunately, it still doesn't work
DDR-Handarbeitsmodell Altbau E-Lok E 95 03 DRG/ DR, the locomotive was used in Silesia and central Germany, the very rare locomotive probably comes from the model railway enthusiast ME Heft 11/1968 conversion proposal, used with play marks and missing parts see photos, functions well, The E 95 series is a heavy freight electric locomotive of the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft (DRG), which was designed for the traction of heavy coal freight trains in the Silesian network. The kit may also have come from the small-series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN.
A locomotive is located in the DB Museum in Halle (Saale) and is operational
In 1924, Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft commissioned AEG to submit proposals for an electric locomotive that should be able to transport 2,200-ton coal trains and 530-ton passenger trains at a travel speed of 45 km/h on this route.
A maximum speed of 65 km/h was required.
Thus the DRG decided in March 1926 on the delivery as a 1'Co+Co1' locomotive with Tatzlager drive from AEG for the mechanical part, and from Siemens-Schuckertwerke for the electrical part.
From December 1927 to June 1928, six locomotives were delivered, which received the operating numbers E 95 01–06.
Everyone survived the Second World War and found themselves on the territory of the future GDR afterwards.
In 1946, the locomotives arrived in the Soviet Union as reparation goods.
They returned to Germany until November 1952.
At the Reichsbahnausbesserungswerk Dessau, the suitability for refurbishment of all six locomotives was determined.
[4] As the re-electrification of the central German network progressed, there was an increasing need for locomotives for heavy freight train service. In 1959, the three locomotives E 95 01 to E 95 03 were overhauled, with the remaining machines serving as spare parts donors.
At first, the E 04, E 44 and E 94, which were available in greater numbers, were preferred to be built.
Only when it was clear that the E 94 could not be further increased, did the E 95 come into focus.
[4] At first, the locomotives were stationed at the Leipzig-Wahren railway depot.
They arrived at the Halle P depot in 1960.
They were mostly used on their own schedule in front of coal trains from the Geiseltal towards Halle, Leipzig and Erfurt.
With increasing age, the complex controls on the locomotives proved to be problematic.
It often happened that shooters got stuck when changing gears.
Then the fireman, who was constantly riding on this locomotive, had to use a hammer and a wooden wedge to release the brake while the train was in motion.
Damage to the traction motors occurred frequently and led to months-long outages for the locomotive.
[5] Since there were enough new-build locomotives available at the end of the 1960s and a significant expansion of electric operations was not planned, the Reichsbahn was able to do without old locomotives and most of the splinter classes, so that the E 95s were taken out of service.
In addition, the Deutsche Reichsbahn only wanted to operate electric locomotives with a one-man crew, which would have been a problem in train operations due to the difficulties with the machines and the visibility from the driver's cab.
[5] After mid-1969, the E 95 02 and E 95 03 were taken out of service, followed by the E 95 01 on October 5, 1970.
The intended new designation 255 001 was therefore never used.
All the locomotives, with the exception of the E 95 02, have been dismantled.
E 95 02 was set up as a switch heater at the main station in Halle as a replacement for the future museum locomotive E 77 10.
It took some time before the authorities at the Reichsbahn were convinced that the E 95 was worth preserving as a museum locomotive.
In 1979, the initial external restoration of the locomotive began with the goal of being able to present it at a vehicle show in the RAW Dessau.
[5] Since then, it has been part of the Dresden Transport Museum as a non-operational museum locomotive.
In 1986, the locomotive was fully completed on the inside.
The locomotive is cared for in a museum setting at the DB Museum in Halle (Saale).
Since 1995, employees of the Traditionsgemeinschaft Bw Halle P have been working on restoring the locomotive to operational condition.
In April 2015, the locomotive could be presented for the first time at an exhibition in the Museum Bw Arnstadt with new internal and external paintwork, where the transformers were checked and five drive motors were operational.
-The locomotives were used on the Silesian Mountain Railway and its branch lines until 1945, where they proved their worth due to their reliable drive and low maintenance requirements.
In February 1945, the machines were relocated to Leipzig for the central German network.
Its main area of operation was initially Silesia
Handcrafted H0 model in OVP, functioning well, it is necessary to carry out optical work on the locomotive in your own time, dusty, with signs of play, musty smell !!!, very rare handcrafted model, very small edition - possibly the kit also comes from the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN
The packaging may have labels and storage markings.
Yes, it's the F-parts.
I got a bed from you.
However, there were problems with one part.
The middle beam is held up by two feet. Unfortunately, these are too narrow and the beam cannot be mounted on the feet.
What do we do now?
I can't build the bed.
The middle beam is held up by two feet, which are unfortunately produced in error.
The middle beam does not fit into the designated holder.
So I get new ones sent to me.
When will they be sent on their way?
No, no flats.
These are, according to the installation instructions, the right ones in terms of shape, they were just too narrow
But that doesn't matter.
As long as they fulfill their purpose
They are not flat with me
Could I get this sent to me?
Hello #NAME#, shall I explain the problem to you again?
House fire with two minor injuries and high damage
Two people have been slightly injured in a house fire in Upper Bavaria.
In addition, an estimated damage in the six-digit euro range has been caused, as the police announced on Sunday.
The fire had apparently spread from a carport to the adjacent house in Kinsau (Landsberg am Lech district).
According to reports, two residents were taken to the hospital with minor smoke inhalation on Sunday.
The exact cause of the fire was initially unknown, but the police did not suspect arson.
The criminal investigation department in Fürstenfeldbruck has taken over further investigations.
It will then arrive much later
And I have to pay shipping again
To counter fake news - Biontech CEO publishes vaccination photo
Uğur Şahin published a photo of his first vaccination at the beginning of 2021 on the social network "LinkedIn"
So far, Biontech CEO Uğur Şahin had not commented publicly on his vaccination status.
Now the entrepreneur has published a photo that shows his corona vaccination.
The illness of a friend had inspired him, said Şahin.
The CEO and co-founder of the Mainz-based company Biontech, Uğur Şahin, has published a photo showing him receiving a vaccination against the coronavirus.
In social media, false information was spread that I was supposedly not vaccinated.
In fact, my wife and I have received three doses of the Biontech-Pfizer vaccine," wrote Şahin on Friday in a post on the "LinkedIn" network.
"For months now, friends have been urging me to post a photo of me getting vaccinated to counter these false rumors."
So far, he has refused, because the communication shouldn't be about himself.
But a call last week has changed his mind: "I was deeply saddened when I heard that an old school friend of mine is currently fighting for his life.
He is fighting a severe case of Covid-19 and has been on a ventilator for three weeks.
The school friend and his family are not vaccinated, continued Şahin.
He did not ask for the reason.
However, the most common cause seems to be fear, which is often fueled by misinformation and mistrust.
Fear is difficult to combat with facts, sometimes it's better to share personal experiences.
An interview with Deutsche Welle is circulating on the Internet, in which Uğur Şahin says that he is not vaccinated.
However, the video was made in December 2020, as Deutsche Welle itself clarified.
"It is currently not allowed by law for me to get the vaccine myself," said Şahin at the time.
There is a prioritisation of the vaccination of the vaccine in Germany.
Meanwhile, the prioritisation has long been lifted - and according to his own statements, the Biontech CEO has been vaccinated three times.
Fire at substation: Tens of thousands of people without electricity
In several municipalities in North Rhine-Westphalia, the lights went out on Friday evening: no more electricity, and in many cases probably also no heating.
A fire had put a substation out of action.
After a fire with severe damage to a substation, tens of thousands of people in the Rhein-Sieg district in North Rhine-Westphalia had to do without electricity for around 24 hours.
On Friday evening, the lights went out for 41,000 affected residents and residents in several municipalities as a result of the fire.
Westnetz reported that numerous emergency power generators were in operation on Saturday until the large-scale disruption was finally resolved late in the evening.
Firefighters and helpers from the THW provided support in the municipalities.
Authorities offered care places in schools and called for help from neighbours.
The provider thanked those affected for their patience and the helpers for their efforts.
We are very aware that the last 24 hours have brought significant disruption.
We would also like to thank the affected municipalities, the district, the fire brigades and the THW for their tireless efforts," said the Head of the Primary Technology Department, Florian Witt, in a statement on Saturday evening.
Repairing the damage will take a few more days, as the Westnetz fitters were only able to put some of the lines back into operation provisionally, he explained.
According to the company, a technical defect led to the fire.
Electricity is flowing again
According to Westnetz, the fire that broke out at 7:15 p.m. on Friday severely damaged parts of the 10,000-volt switchgear in the Neunkirchen-Seelscheid substation.
There, extensive cleaning and repair work is required.
At the same time, a connection to a 30,000-volt voltage level has been created.
With the help of this bypass, the electricity supply is restored.
Since 6 p.m. on Saturday, more than 21,000 people in Much and Ruppichteroth have had electricity again.
An additional 20,000 residents of Neunkirchen-Seelscheid were gradually connected after 9:30 p.m.
Since 11:15 p.m., those affected by the outage would also have electricity.
More than 80 electricians from Westnetz and partner companies were deployed.
Authorities had also called for help from neighbours after setting up an emergency power supply for important buildings on Saturday afternoon.
"It is now important that the citizens take care of older or single people in their neighborhood and let the local fire station know if help is needed," explained district administrator Sebastian Schuster (CDU) after a crisis meeting.
When setting up and running emergency power generators, the focus was mainly on the residents of nursing homes.
In addition, according to authorities, temporary care places were set up in schools for those people who could not provide for themselves or who need electricity-dependent medical equipment or medical care.
Guten Tag!
Unfortunately the ceiling is sold out in Germany.
Can I buy them from you and pay in Euros?
It is the day blanket #PRS_ORG# in blue-green.
I hope you also have a nice day and please stay healthy ♡
But I can't mount the undercarriage on the table top.
It's Custom #NAME#.
There are 3 versions of it.
We wanted those with table-top diameters of #NUMBER#.
We received 155cm in diameter.
My #PRS_ORG# arrived today, but I can't push them together to shorten them.
Can you help me with that?
Otherwise I would have to send them back because they are not suitable for the purpose.
I'd love to hear from you.
Yes, that's really easier!
Then let's do it that way!
Will you send me the return label by email?
The repair is now complete.
I had already tried this before the chat.
However, I hadn't restarted the E-#PRS_ORG# before the purchase.
Should I do it now?
I find such a low credit almost impertinent.
We do not agree with that
Nordic Combined: Riiber wins
German Nordic combined skiers Fabian Rießle and Julian Schmid have sprinted onto the podium at the World Cup in Otepää, Estonia.
Once again the duo had to give in to the outstanding Norwegian Jarl Magnus Riiber, who had already started with a large lead in the cross-country skiing after the ski jump.
Return for order number #NUMBER#
When will the money be returned to my account?
Yes, we both did a fresh install and are using version 4.5...
It could be that they have already heard of problems.
I just bought a book with my #PRS_ORG#, it seems to be on it.
When I try to open it, I get the message, oops!
This document could not be opened.
If you think the file is faulty, contact customer service.
As far as I can tell it is a #PRS_ORG# epub file.
Can they help me?
The chat connection is gone and now what?
I also have to work in between!
To ensure an even and clean paint finish, you should clean the parts with some soapy water to remove dust, grease, and fingerprints, rinse with clear water, and dry.
Before you apply the brush with a new color to the model for the first time, it is advisable to practice 2 to 3 strokes.
You can do this on the inside of the building parts, which will not be visible later, or on a yogurt cup.
The first mark on the part
Stroke the brush side by side, evenly.
Light overlap of the colour layers later results in a uniform surface.
Avoid swiping the brush back and forth quickly.
This results in areas that look unrealistic.
A model is not a garden fence.
Start with the light colours.
Otherwise, the dark ones could shine through later.
Metal tones and metallic colors come at the very end with a separate brush.
Otherwise, unsightly metal streaks can occur when they are mixed with normal paints.
Let the painted parts dry for a day before installing them.
The models achieve an original look through the decals, i.e. stickers.
From national insignia on aircraft to ship names to trim and badges on car models: the decals give the model the finishing touch.
Apply the decals in the correct order, while the parts are still easy to reach.
It is easier to cover a plane cockpit before it is installed in the fuselage.
Time, patience and a steady hand are even more important than the right tools such as scissors, tweezers and a toothpick when it comes to sticking.
Cut out each needed decal individually and lay them out.
Decals are also called water slide decals because you briefly wet the back with water until the backing paper turns dark from the moisture.
Then you just slide the picture a little bit off the paper and place the piece on the corresponding place on the model (which you have also previously moistened).
While holding the decal in place on the model with a tool, pull the backing paper off to the side.
Warning: Always check that the picture is in the right place before sliding it completely off the paper, so that it does not stick to your finger, crease or even tear.
Suck up any excess water with a household cloth.
Warning: Not suitable for children under 3 years
I can only open a book briefly, once I look for something else then I can no longer read the book and have to log out and log in and reload the book and find the place where I was reading up to.
On Saturday, I have already communicated with you.
Do I get this by email?
Even for all 3 packages?
Because the lamp was delivered to me in 3 separate packages
Okay, thank you anyway!
Then I will shop elsewhere as soon as the money is back.
But can I get it back without any problems?
Fertility treatment with private health insurance / What is a "case of insurance"?
Hello everyone,
We have been in fertility treatment for some time, now, when it comes to billing the private health insurance, they are suddenly standing in our way.
One after the other:
We had applied to the private health insurance for the fertility treatment in advance and received a commitment for 3 attempts.
The experiments were in no way (e.g. time frame, success, etc.) limited.
The first attempt led directly to a successful pregnancy and birth and was billed to the private health insurance.
Some time later, we tried to get a second child, and we had 2 (unsuccessful) attempts, but we hadn't claimed these with the private health insurance yet.
We applied again for reimbursement from the private health insurance, and again we were granted 3 more attempts.
After a few more attempts (we did more attempts than promised, of course the most expensive ones are billed to the private health insurance company), we submitted the bills to the private health insurance company and got the bad surprise: instead of 5 attempts (2+3), the private health insurance company will only reimburse 3 attempts.
The reason: With the pregnancy/birth, the other two attempts of the first promise fall away.
The second child wish is a new insurance case.
According to the terms and conditions, however, "The insurance event begins with medical treatment, and ends when there is no longer a need for treatment."
The questions for the experts in the round here:
* Who is right here, the private health insurance (only 3 attempts will be reimbursed) or we (5 attempts must be reimbursed)?
* Would the private health insurance have to inform us in their promises that further attempts would be lost with a birth?
* Is the desire for a second child really a new insurance case?
The infertility (caused by blocked fallopian tubes) is not cured by the first child.
It would be great if the experts here could give their opinion.
Thanks in advance for your help!
Can you please send me the three options by email and tell me how best to reach you again
Okay.
We will never order from them again.
When they add my sales and my friend #NAME#'s (same address) together, they have obviously lost a good customer.
They are welcome to pass this on to their manager.
That's not competitive.
Yesterday the colleague told me that the repayment was triggered and now you are telling me that I have to send the thing back first.
I can't do anything about the fact that the chest of drawers arrives completely damaged at my place
Please see in the screenshot what the colleague has written
There is clear evidence that a refund was requested and I still have not received a refund from #PRS_ORG#
They can tell their manager that they've now lost two regular customers.
My friend has also ordered various pieces of furniture for our apartment through his account.
We won't do that anymore.
No, the defect only appeared after a few months.
An office chair must be able to withstand normal use.
Otherwise, they are not allowed to sell it as an office chair.
Regardless, the 24-month warranty applies.
No, I'm not able to get a different kind of packaging.
I will take the cupboard apart and make it available to the transport company.
Hello, I have a question about your series from #PRS_ORG#
These products are advertised with additional footstools, but unfortunately, we cannot find these with you.
Can they help?
Theme of the week: The best low budget films
There is no general definition of what a low-budget film is, with exact budget limits.
The Wikipedia has this to say about it:
A **low-budget film** or **low-budget movie** is a motion picture shot with little to no funding from a major film studio or private investor.
You can find plenty of lists of low-budget films online, such as on Letterboxd.com.
Do you know any interesting representatives of this category?
What appeals to you about it?
And what do you perhaps not like at all?
I am a very good customer of yours, I have furnished two apartments completely with your furniture.
Asked for the best price for the gray leather Odelle sofa.
The delivery time has now been extended again, is it now reliable?
Thank you very much
With kind regards,
If there is no phone number, a chat where you have to wait for 30 minutes is not a chat!
Unfortunately, nothing changes in the waiting position... I will soon give up again, because it just doesn't work here.
Hello
"Half win" against Belarus associated with high costs for the EU
According to the political expert, Raphael Bossong, the EU can announce a "half victory" in the conflict with the Belarusian regime.
However, the costs are very high and mean massive violations of the rights of migrants and refugees on the Belarus border with Poland and Lithuania, said Bossong to the Evangelical Press Service (epd).
The EU has not resolved the confrontation in a sustainable way, explained the researcher of the Berlin Foundation for Science and Politics (SWP).
This state of limbo - Belarus is not quite giving in, but the EU feels like a winner - will probably continue for a while.
Bossong ruled that the treatment of people at the border was not in keeping with the European Convention on Human Rights.
Apparently, there is an "increasing normalisation of pushbacks" by individual EU governments.
Since the EU as a whole has not decided to stand up against it, this comes at the cost of fundamental rights.
This development is weakening the cohesion of the Union at the same time.
"She can't apparently assert herself if a member state decides to do its own thing," as is currently the case with Poland, which does not even allow the EU border protection agency Frontex access to the border.
In addition, the EU is paying another price for its policy at the border with Belarus, according to Bossong: A fundamental agreement on asylum policy is being made more difficult as the line "border protection, border protection, border protection" has been strengthened.
Another attempt to cross the border
According to the Polish Border Guard, meanwhile, migrants have once again attempted to enter Poland from Belarus.
Fifty-five migrants were arrested and returned to the border overnight on Sunday, a spokeswoman for the agency said on Sunday.
The Polish officials were pelted with stones by the migrants during the incident near the town of Czeremsza.
A soldier was hit in the face and had to be medically treated by a military doctor, according to reports.
In total, the border patrol registered 52 attempted border crossings within 24 hours.
As early as Friday evening, a group of 28 migrants had crossed the border barriers.
Thousands of people from countries like Iraq and Afghanistan had crossed or tried to cross the border between Belarus and the EU in recent months.
The EU accuses Alexander Lukashenko, the ruler in Minsk, of luring them with the prospect of entry into the EU.
Poland and Lithuania have reportedly sealed off sections of their borders.
The EU has sanctioned Belarus and threatened airlines that bring migrants and refugees into the country.
In addition, EU Commissioners travelled to the people's countries of origin to prevent them from leaving there.
The most effective element of the EU's response was the pressure on the airlines, said Bossong.
"The EU has thrown its market power into the balance and demonstrated its resolve to operate with a heavy hand and extraterritorial sanctions".
Minsk must also consider internal political costs.
Belarusian society is probably not prepared for the fact that the security apparatus regularly funnels thousands of people through the country.
Mercedes protests controversial Formula 1 finale
According to Mercedes, Max Verstappen broke two rules during the race.
Abu Dhabi - After the controversial Formula 1 finale in Abu Dhabi, Mercedes has lodged an appeal.
The Silver Arrows suspect two rule violations in the last Grand Prix of the year.
A protest relates to an alleged infringement by Max Verstappen in the Red Bull in the last safety car phase, when he is said to have made an illegal overtake.
A second protest was lodged against the scoring at the end of the race.
According to Mercedes, the protocol was not followed in accordance with the rules.
Verstappen had passed Lewis Hamilton in the Mercedes on the last lap and raced to his first Formula 1 title.
The manoeuvre took place shortly after the end of a Safety Car phase in which the Dutch driver had overtaken the car in front of him.
I'm going to check it.
I will speak with the bank and get back to you
thank you for the support
Free admission for members: Europa-Park holds SC Freiburg fan day
The Europa-Park, which is the namesake of the Europa-Park Stadium of SC Freiburg, has invited to the SC Freiburg Fan Day.
As the park reports, members and season ticket holders of the sports club from the Breisgau region as well as members of the fan community were allowed to visit the Europa-Park for free on that day.
In addition there were vouchers for drinks and sausages.
The roller coaster cars were lit up in red and white that day.
Füchsle, Ed Euromaus and many red and white balloons created the perfect setting," said the park.
The cooperation between the Bundesliga club and the leisure park in Rust, 40 kilometers north of Freiburg, has existed since the beginning of the 1990s.
The first SC Freiburg fan day at the Europa-Park has once again shown how well the partnership fits.
Seeing beaming fans having fun on the roller coaster together confirms this," says Europa-Park owner Jürgen Mack.
why is it €#NUMBER# and not like the original 1699€?
Stages in the career of the new world champion Verstappen
The Dutchman Max Verstappen is the new Formula 1 world champion.
Max Verstappen has done it.

Judith Hermann read from her novel "Daheim"
As part of the reading series "LiteraTour Nord", author Judith Hermann read from her current novel "Daheim" at the sold-out Blue Note on Friday and also served as moderator.
She is divorced, lives in a house on the coast, and listens sensitively to the nightly sounds at her front door.
I submitted a contact form yesterday to return an item but have not received an email confirmation or anything similar.
My question would be whether my request has been received.
Not everyone has the time for your idiotic chat and cheap goods from China.
Your mistake to fix and not all of us from our household.
Contact Ms. #NAME#.
I can't chat with them every day
We chatted yesterday and agreed that I or Mrs. #NAME# would receive an email with a 60 Euro voucher, a re-order of the #PRS_ORG# bedside table and a return label.
This email has not yet been received.
The package wants to bring it to #PRS_ORG# today.
Please contact me

I'm sorry, but just because he says he's not an antisemite doesn't mean anything.
This is like if an AfD person says they have nothing against foreigners.
Both of them will not admit their i.
But Kollegah is constantly reproducing any kind of antisemitic messages.
If you want to distance yourself, then you should just let it go completely.
Yes wow then you are just as hard to take seriously as Kollegah.
Anyone who seriously questions evolution in general is just completely lost.
According to me, a god set the whole thing in motion.
But once you're a creationist, you have to believe that the Earth is 10,000 years old and that science is just nonsense.
And with that, you are an enemy of science and not to be taken seriously like Kollegah.
To achieve an optimal field of vision, the magnifying glass should be brought as close as possible to the eye.
The specifically aplanatic-achromatic lens system allows you to use the magnifying glass practically free of distortion and colour errors even in the edge zone.
Often, magnifiers are marked with magnification specifications.
These values, however, only apply to exactly defined conditions, which seldom correspond to the conditions of use.
To get the most out of your loupe, please refer to the notes in the "Technical data" table (see user manual in the packaging).
Light reflections occur on the lens surfaces of all optical devices - including magnifying glasses.
These reflections are greatly reduced by an anti-reflective coating.
Under optimal conditions of use - the magnifying glass held close to the eye - reflections on the lens surfaces are less noticeable.

Christmas tree sale in Schönwolde: In the municipality of Krembz, women choose the Christmas trees
Farmer Frank Diers has already experienced many curious situations when selling Christmas trees.
Once, a man even drove home without his partner, because they couldn't agree.
Every year he plants around 2000 of them.
The 56-year-old has already experienced many curious situations.
This makes the pre-Christmas season a bit more fun, he says.
And what about the coupon?
Otherwise, I'm gone as a customer?!
After all, I received a faulty delivery and now I have to pay the full price for it.
Then I will evaluate it accordingly!
We don't need to discuss which is the better dish here, but there are some similarities between the two.
They both consist of meat that is grilled on a rotating skewer.
And both have therefore their name.
In German, an equivalent might be something like the "Dreher", which doesn't sound nearly as tasty.
Problems with fibre optic + Devolo DLan/Magic
We've had a new fiber-optic connection in the house for a few weeks now.
Unfortunately, I now have trouble setting up a stable Wi-Fi network.
Previously, I had a DSL 50 Mbit connection and used Devolo DLan, which received and sent 50 Mbit without any problems, except for a few outages.
The new fiber-optic connection sends 500 Mbit to the FritzBox 7590, and these also arrive at the DLan module, which is connected to the FritzBox.
However, on the other DLan module which sends out the Wifi, I don't get the full 500, but the further away I am from the module in the house, the less I get (so I use an outlet that is 1, 2, 3, etc. rooms away from the other module).
This means that the internet with the new fibre-optic connection is now even slower on the first floor than it was before (\~45 Mbit).
I have also ordered a new Devolo Magic Set, which apparently uses a new technology.
This was slightly better than the DLan, but here too the losses were similarly large.
Could someone explain to me why so much internet speed is lost over the power line with fiber optics?
And is LAN really the only solution?
It would be extremely labor-intensive to run LAN cables in the house.
I am really desperate, which is why I have created a special account here.
For this reason, I would be all the more pleased to receive an answer.
When it's time to switch bank accounts
Those who thought that there would now be a period of calm with regard to the current accounts are in for a surprise.
While many banks have used autumn to have their customers confirm the fee increases of the past with all sorts of tricks, the free limits for negative interest rates are also falling further.
The Deutsche Bank, for example, was long considered relatively generous with a limit of 100,000 euros.
Now, she has halved the tax-free allowance and even quartered it for day-to-day money.
In a first step, the limit was only lowered for customers of the group's Postbank division - to 50,000 euros for current and investment accounts and to 25,000 euros for savings accounts.
However, these lower allowances now apply to the entire Deutsche Bank, as a spokesperson confirmed in response to a request.
And not just for new contracts, but also for "new individual agreements made with existing customers".
The Commerzbank had already gone down to a limit of 50,000 euros, which is still in force, as is the case at ING Deutschland.
The direct bank DKB, which is especially popular with cost-conscious customers, has lowered the free allowances in two stages, first to 50,000 euros, and now to 25,000 euros.
After all: More than 100 banks now have a tax-free limit of 25,000 euros or less, according to figures from the Internet portal Verivox.
Sparda-Bank Berlin has also arrived at 25,000 euros: However, there is still a legal dispute with the consumer centres, which have even been given right in the first instance by the Berlin Regional Court.
Now the banks are already discussing whether the institutes should possibly make provisions – in case the higher authorities also declare negative interest rates to be in principle unlawful and many millions have to be paid back to bank customers.

Jennifer Aniston hires a whole beauty army
She is now officially at the top of Hollywood.
But their lives are like a roller coaster.
Jennifer Aniston (52) was chosen by the US magazine "The Hollywood Reporter" as the most influential woman of the year.
For her, who made a splash in 2021 with the "Friends" reunion and the continuation of her series "The Morning Show", this success is first and foremost the result of a lot of discipline and work.
An entire army of assistants, stylists and trainers takes care of her looks.
After all, so Aniston, she treats herself to a chip a day (yes, read correctly: a single chip from the bag).
The fact that their hearts fly to both male and female fans is actually a miracle.
Maybe she just has bad luck with luck - and is still looking for the great love.
And crossed off the baby wish from the list.
Prior to this, she was constantly asked when she was going to become a mother.
That hurt her.
The people asking those questions have no idea what's going on with me personally, medically, why I can't do it.
It was really hurtful.
It remains to be hoped that success and fame will bring happiness.
Shameful end to a career: Räikkönen has to give up
Kimi Räikkönen's farewell from Formula 1 was even quieter than expected.
Abu Dhabi - The 42-year-old Finn took off his gloves and wiped the sweat from his forehead.
That was it.
After a driving error and a slight collision with a band, Räikkönen had to stop his Alfa Romeo at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix after less than half of the race distance.
It was his 349th and last Grand Prix, the "Iceman" ends his career in the top class of motorsport.
For the farewell, his wife Minttu and the two children had also travelled to the United Arab Emirates.
Raikkonen's greatest success was winning the 2007 World Championship in a Ferrari.
He won 21 Grand Prix, started 18 times from pole and reached the podium 103 times. dpa
Friedrich wins 60th World Cup victory - Nolte wins two-man bobsleigh - Sport
The record of the Norwegian biathlete Ole Einar Björndalen with 94 victories is the goal of the bobsleigh driver.
"I worked it out, I would have to win nine and a half races per season, then I could make it to Cortina 2026," said the double Olympic champion from BSC Oberbärenburg, who achieved two successes in two days at the races in Winterberg.
On Saturday, he fended off an attack from Johannes Lochner by five hundredths of a second, moving up from third to first place.
Then he changed something in the material setting and on Sunday he pulled out a bigger lead of 0.30 seconds.
With his team Thorsten Margis (SV Halle), Candy Bauer (BSC Oberbärenburg) and Alexander Schüller (SV Halle) he beat the Brit Brad Hall.
The Austrian Benjamin Maier came in third.
"We took a bigger risk today and were rewarded," said Friedrich, who also won his 22nd race in a row.
Berchtesgaden's Johannes Lochner, who was driving for Stuttgart, came fifth this time after coming second previously.
Christoph Hafer from BC Bad Feilnbach landed in eighth place after finishing fourth in the first race.
"If I knew what he does differently, then I would do it that way too," said Lochner.
Nolte with home victory - Podium for Jamanka
At the women's race, Laura Nolte won the third season victory on her home track in the two-man bobsleigh.
After finishing fourth in the monobob the day before, she raced with pusher Deborah Levi to victory in the World Cup on Sunday.
Two-person bobsleigh Olympic champion Mariama Jamanka from BRC Thuringia came in second with Germany's fastest sprinter, Alexandra Burghardt from Burghausen.
In addition to qualifying for the Olympics, she recorded her first podium finish this winter.
The Wiesbadenerin Kim Kalicki landed with Leonie Fiebig in third place.
It was supercool for me, my first podium in the World Cup, I'm superhappy that Mariama is taking me along.
I'm super happy with the development.
There is still a lot of potential at the start, but the start times today were okay", said Burghardt and emphasized: "It's not just pushing, there is also a lot to do around it".
Jamanka was a little annoyed about the not quite flawless rides, but said: "It's heading in the right direction".
I had the duvet in my basket and could buy it now!!!
What am I supposed to do?
I did not receive it and therefore could not redeem it, which is why I finally asked about it.
Last year I had completely different problems due to Corona and never had time for it.
And now it was said that he was out-of-date, which made me very angry.
Look in the chat, it was about the Asare bench.
I would like to return it and then re-order as it is on sale right now :)
Why will delivery only start on 16.3?
There was nothing on your website about such a long delivery time
No, only when I tap comes an extra field with the message
It was taken yesterday by your colleague.
Why is this a problem today?
I have also sent you pictures of the incorrectly delivered goods.
But we would still like to have the shelf unit, just a new, undamaged one.
And not to cancel the entire order.
Only this day, only this week, only until XY...
Hello, lovely ladies and girls and women,
I have a lot of things that I just want to write down, and maybe it's the same for one or the other...
I'm 24, I have PTSD, I'm a full-time student, and I'm a dog mom - apart from the fact that my dog doesn't cry or go to kindergarten, he's basically my child.
My boyfriend (of 6 years) is ill, got a 2nd degree burn on Monday and has been depressed for years (but is now in therapy).
Yesterday I visited him because I also have emotional needs, and because I wanted to see and feel him. We cuddled a lot and it was nice.
I helped him take a shower (because his hand is bandaged due to a burn).
He is also under the weather and we are seeing each other less (1-2x a week) at the moment, which is very difficult for me with my needs for affection and love.
My puppy has just got tummy ache, I cooked for him and now he is lying in his cuddly blanket and has relaxed a bit after I was there with the heat lamp and petting him.
I live alone with my sister and mother, and my mother is away for a month.
Now we're also getting homework, which of course we have to divide up between us.
But even cooking is a lot of work for me...
My PTSD is currently well-adjusted, I'm half-way well-treated and coping.
Not great, but I'm coping and I'm almost symptom-free.
My university is currently demanding a lot from me (for me), tomorrow at 3 p.m. I have a written test for which I haven't done anything yet, and the day after tomorrow I have an anatomy class for which I should at least prepare a bit.
And next week I have an oral exam on Tuesday, and what comes after that is in my calendar and not in my head because there is no more room there.
So, my week goes like this: Only until tomorrow, then it's the weekend.
But after that, it goes on, doesn’t it?
Only until his birthday.
Only until the start of the holidays.
Only until the weekend.
Only until...
And so it goes on forever.
I think I'm just so stressed that I need these mental touchstones, otherwise I don't know what to do.
Somehow I feel guilty and "chaotic," but I can't do it any other way...
Do you feel the same way?
Seriously, I'm infinitely grateful that I don't have to work.
I'm really infinitely grateful, I can't even put it into words.
I don't know if I would have survived my kptbs otherwise.
I think that has something to do with the mental load of women, and that's why I thought I would find fellow sufferers here...
I wish you all a restful evening, the week is almost over!
Today I got my order, unfortunately the whole thing is a different colour plus the surface is scratched and the table leg has an imprint.
The first shipment was exactly the same color as on the website.
We are very disappointed!!!!
What can you offer me?
If we exchange the table now, will I get a different color, or what?
The email to cancel was sent on 26.12.#NUMBER#.
By the way, twice.
However, it was not confirmed.
Something completely different: I noticed in school that many religion teachers don't believe in God and for them it's just another subject like maths or geography.
For me it was always a bit strange, maybe also because I was raised Christian and I always believed it somehow.
How do you feel about it?
Maybe you can also talk about colleagues at work or at university with different attitudes.
In principle, I understand the difference between private and professional, and it makes sense to keep them separate.
After all, there is also a curriculum and so on.
But I would also find it strange to have a physics teacher who doesn't believe in the theory of relativity.
What makes someone want to teach religion if they don't believe in it?
To preserve culture or something like that?
I hope your question is not too personal.
Can't it be changed or not? Please write in English, I understand it well.
That has been a very long time ago, then I would advise against it
That's good, thank you.
I expect a response soon, at the very latest by the beginning of next week.
Thank you for your support #NAME#.
Film search help please
Hello dear people,
I'm looking for a film from my childhood (I'm 24).
I think it was a film for young people.
The film has two timelines (or parallel universes).
On the one hand, modernity (the real world).
On the other hand, the past (or the land of the dead) (not sure).
Since I can't really describe it in the real world, there's a young woman.
And in the land of the dead, a young soldier (uniform similar to that of the soldiers from Pirates of the Caribbean).
For some reason, the paths cross, and a plot is created.
The antagonist is also a soldier from the realm of the dead who wants to bring the woman to this realm in order to be able to live himself, I mean.
I think the transition is also the grave of the soldier.
In the end, I think both soldiers are fighting against each other.
If that means anything to you, I'm grateful for any response.
Our little one has only slept on her front from week 1.
Fast forward: still alive :D
Relax.
A child can take a lot more than you think.
Make sure everything else is right, no cuddly toys, go in there more often and take a look, but no minutes of surveillance.
That makes you insane!
Fresh air in the room.
A good mattress.
No pillows.
Oh and ours didn't have a sleeping bag, but always had a blanket.
Observe your child when it is sleeping.
Does it turn its head to the side?
Can it raise itself up from its belly?
Or does it lie face down, directly in the mattress?
You can tell from that whether everything is all right.
We've all grown up and when my husband was born, for example, it was common practice to put kids on their stomachs to sleep.
Also, we are already "regular customers" with you and have already bought a lot of articles
But why are you offering me only 20 euros?
Hello, I have already written to one of your colleagues yesterday and have not yet received a response.
It's about my wardrobe that arrived yesterday (order number: #ALPHANUMERIC-ID#).
The right-hand drawer does not fit in the cabinet.
I ask you to contact me as soon as possible.
The cupboard is currently not usable.
To put it bluntly.
RBTV promised a lot.
And yes, I know myself that not everything can be held.
And I also had a lot of fun with RBTV.
It's just that the policy of this station is now at rock bottom.
Nearly every format is sponsored (ok), but then go on a big begging tour at the same time.
It was said to be an "independent" Internet broadcaster.
Quote from Arno: "We don't want to be a running litfaßsäule."
What are you now?
A 0815 advertising station that is trying to sell its BilloMerch to the elite fan.
And then there are Marah's do's and don'ts.
Naturally, they apply to everyone, except Simon and Etienne.
Of course, they may continue to insult people.
A Krogmann who completely lacks empathy and who, at the expense of the action with the rented rooms that have exploded, is trying to make ashes.
How can one find all of this good?
It's great if you like it, I find it terrible.
I ask for a callback, as my delivered wooden table was delivered defective.

Whether as a comforter for stomach ache or just for cuddling - my little heat buddy is multi-purpose.
Cherry-pit pillows are a traditional home remedy for soothing warmth applications, as cherry pits can absorb and release heat very well.
The removable inner cushion can be easily heated in the microwave or oven.
The soft material makes the application particularly pleasant, so that the little ones feel comfortable, even when they are not feeling well.
The cherry stone pillow with cover is suitable as a heat pad exclusively for the following areas of application:
Before warming the kiss, check for unusual smells, stock or burn marks and dispose of immediately if present.
Please remove the inner cushion from the cover before warming it up!
Heat in the microwave at max. 300 watts for max. 2 minutes (follow the instructions of the microwave manufacturer!)
Immediately after heating, distribute the heat evenly throughout the cushion by shaking it!
Then put the inner cushion back into the cover.
During the first warm-ups, there may be a slight moisture formation on the surface, but this disappears with repeated use.
Make sure to follow the specified heating instructions, as longer times or higher energy levels can cause damage (risk of ignition and burns!).
Check the manufacturer's instructions before microwaving a heating pad to see if heating a grain product is allowed.
After putting the heated inner cushion back into the cover, please check the temperature of the cushion for suitability for babies (max. 43 °C) on your forearm!
Do not use the cushion for acute and chronic, inflammatory or feverish illnesses, circulatory problems, fresh bruises, blood spots and open wounds as well as for people with reduced pain sensitivity.
If you have existing skin, heart, vein, diabetes or tumour diseases or if you are pregnant, please consult a doctor before use.
If seams have opened and loose kernels are escaping, dispose of the product and the loose kernels immediately and out of reach of children.
If the product is used on babies under 1 year of age, the child's temperature should be checked regularly during use to prevent overheating!
All serious incidents related to the product must be reported to the manufacturer and the relevant authority of the country where the user is registered.
The cover is removable and can be washed in the machine at 30 °C.
Please note the care symbols on the product!
Darmstadt in second place after the first leg - Pauli wins in Düsseldorf
Darmstadt 98 is allowed to dream of returning to the German Football League.
In the meantime, Hannover 96 is working its way out of the table cellar.
For Ingolstadt, it's not going well even under the third coach.
There was jubilation in Darmstadt after the late victory in the top game, joy in Hannover over interim coach Christoph Dabrowski, and frustration in Ingolstadt after the unsuccessful debut under the new coach Rüdiger Rehm.
Is the battery broken?
Last night, my laptop (ThinkPad E480 20KQ and about 3 years old) was no longer being charged by my power adapter.
I bought this about 5 months ago, so it should still work.
I thought that the power supply alone was enough to operate.
No luck, the battery is dead and the laptop won't start despite the power adapter being plugged in.
I then removed the battery, but nothing happened here either.
Perhaps you have ideas?
A new battery has been ordered, but why can't I use the laptop in online mode?
Is anything else broken?
Thank you for your help!
I want the delivery of the #PRS_ORG# to my room.
How do I book it?
I am interested in the #PRS_ORG# chair.
But I don't know how high the seat is...
Often on tour and still taking a lot of equipment with you?
No problem with the Peak Design Everyday V2 Backpack!
Its 20-litre capacity can easily swallow larger photographic equipment, which can be safely stored using the padded FlexFold dividers.
And what other everyday items you need, remain thanks to the practical access points in the individually configurable interior, well organised and separate from the photo equipment.
With the "update" of the Everyday Line to Version 2 (V2), the series is also presented in a new look.
The sleek, minimalist design has it all - with the Everyday Backpack series, Peak Design has developed some highly innovative solutions that reliably protect the interior of the backpack, while still providing instant access to the photographic equipment.
This can be done in two ways: Firstly, the conventional way, via the lid flap, which can be closed using the MagLatch closure system, a well-thought-out solution for effective protection, which has already proved its worth with the messenger bags.
A metal closure hook with corresponding anchor bars on the front of the backpack is located in the closure flap.
Unlike most backpacks, Peak Design has thought of different "fill levels": there are 4 anchor bars, stably riveted, into which the closure hook can be hooked.
If the backpack is fully loaded, you simply take the top bar, if it is rather empty, a deeper one.
The clasp and the hook are also magnetic.
This way, the backpack can also be closed reliably without latching the hook.
The second option also fundamentally distinguishes the Everyday Backpack from other photo backpacks: In addition to the flap lid, there is also a zip opening on both sides of the backpack.
This eliminates the biggest drawback of traditional backpacks with top access - you no longer have to rummage through the contents!
At the same time, this clever detail greatly increases the day-to-day practicality of the backpack: if you take not only your camera equipment, but also everyday items or travel luggage with you.
With the Everyday Backpack, you can individually configure the interior (more on this below) and thus store both things separately - and also access them independently through the two side openings.
You can also pull the backpack forward from the right side to access the camera gear in the right main compartment, while the everyday items stay safely in the left side of the backpack and don't get in the way.
Comfortable, easy-to-adjust carrying straps help with this.
And as the outer shell of the backpack is also made entirely from 100% recycled, weather-resistant nylon, the contents will stay dry even if you're heading to Scotland in the autumn.
Unfortunately, I am waiting in vain for the email from their support.
#NAME# sent me an email yesterday confirming the commissioning of the
The freight forwarding company has announced contact to pick up the wrongly delivered table.
So far, I have not received a message.
I request an immediate settlement.
I have already written to the third support employee, and none of them have gone beyond the promise that I will receive an email as a confirmation.
This is the return of the incorrectly delivered Custom #NAME#.
Is it foreseeable when the wardrobe could be delivered again?
Keeping him is not an option for me...
It works.
Thank you very much for your help
I wish you a nice evening.
Hello, my order number is #NUMBER#. When will the item be delivered?
Order and payment was on 12.1.21.
I was sent a completely different lamp to the one I ordered
Please call me
If you extend the voucher, I will place a larger order, but at least I kept the damaged piece of furniture and didn't send it back.
And that last year went differently than expected, I could not have anticipated, and therefore I was not able to redeem and clarify it in a timely manner.
But I suffered the damage as a customer, and I don't accept that.
Rotinger brake discs are designed for the demands of the dynamic driver, who knows how to appreciate reliability and safety when braking even under difficult conditions.
Rotinger brake discs are cast and then machined (drilled and cut).
All tinted windows are produced in short series according to individual technical characteristics, which are specific to certain windows and patterns.
On the basis of the individual technical drawing, a special manufacturing programme is created, which is adjusted to the balancing of the disk according to the characteristics of the original assembly.
The tuned windshields produced in this way ensure high comfort and braking effectiveness.
The additional cutouts increase the effectiveness of cooling the disc, while the slots improve the cleaning of the brake discs and brake pads.
The aesthetic properties of our tinted windows emphasize the character of each car with an attractive and striking appearance.
Coloma is the town where an unexpected event shaped the history of the West Coast.
In the winter of 1848, a man discovered glowing nuggets in the water at the south fork of the American River.
Although he tried to keep his discovery secret, the news spread quickly and triggered the so-called "California Gold Rush" of 1849.
Thousands came from near and far, and made Coloma one of the fastest growing and thriving cities in the country.
Areas were staked out, tents were pitched, and saloons and hotels sprang up almost overnight.
Everyone wanted their share of the country's wealth.
For many, it was "Coloma or Bust" (Coloma or Bust)!
In this game, you're a pioneer looking to strike it rich in the west and make a name for yourself.
You'll search for gold, recruit workers, gather horses, and build businesses.
You will also have the opportunity to explore the surrounding rivers and adjoining areas.
You are not alone - other pioneers seem to have the same idea!
You have to outperform your pioneer colleagues to not go out of business with the rest of them.
Coloma is a quick strategic game with many paths to victory.
You simultaneously choose your actions, have to manage your resources, and build a tableau that "works" for you more and more (so-called "Engine Building").
The buildings on your tableau allow you to become more efficient, to get extra actions, or to use rules to your advantage.
With these buildings and the dynamic bridge tiles, you can develop your individual style of play with fine adjustments.
Coloma spans a period of three years from 1848 (the year gold was discovered at Coloma), through 1849 (the year of the California Gold Rush), to 1850 (the year California achieved official statehood).
A year in Coloma consists of five rounds.
During each round, players secretly and simultaneously select a location on the game board where they can perform actions.
Afterwards, their selection is revealed and they place their Pioneers on suitable locations.
If a location has the most pioneers, it will be blocked!
This disables one half of the site - reducing the possible actions there.
Then players take turns performing actions, such as winning resources, moving wagons, setting up tents, exploring rivers, building bridges, opening stores, and positioning gunfighters.
When all the actions are completed, the Pioneers return.
The announcer turns to a new location at the start of each round, changing the available actions.
This continues until the spinner has moved five times, i.e. covered each location once, and the year has ended.
There's a shootout in which players must defend Coloma from an attack by angry bandits.
If the players have contributed enough gunslingers and outnumber the bandits, they earn rewards.
However, if they fail, they receive lower rewards or end up in the graveyard.
The game ends after the third shootout, and then the final score is determined.
The player with the most victory points wins!
For free shipping, I take up to the dimensions of 35 x 25 x 4.5 cm the shipping method, goods shipment (games wrapped).
For everything else, I usually use DPD, insured and with tracking (games wrapped in film, wrapped in tiles and packing paper).
If you are a collector, I can also send the box in a box for an additional charge of 2 euros, so that 100% there are no pressure points.
"Why children are not tyrants" documentary, ARD Mediathek
CW psychological violence, sexual abuse, abuse of power
The ARD documentary appeared in my Twitter timeline today, and I watched it straight away.
>The child psychiatrist Michael Winterhoff is a regular guest on talk shows and gives lectures across Europe.
With his book "Why Our Children Become Tyrants" (2008), he sparked a heated debate about education.
Former patients and guardians are now making serious accusations against him.
Please look after yourselves, the film is difficult to watch.
And I am very grateful that many people now think and act differently.
As parents and other responsible persons, it must never, never, never be about power over the child.
Our goal should always be to give the child space for its development and to make the framework for the child as large as it is sensible and possible in the situation.
Brrr, I still shiver.
Holetschek: Countries are discussing the removal of the test requirement for triple vaccinated people
The health ministers of the federal states want to decide on a nationwide abolition of the testing requirement for triple-vaccinated people at their next meeting.
“We countries need clarity quickly on whether and from when the test requirement can be waived for those who have been vaccinated three times”, said Klaus Holetschek (CSU), chairman of the Health Ministers’ Conference, to the “Bild am Sonntag”.
The removal of 2G plus for triple-vaccinated people is "not only medically sensible, but also provides an additional incentive to get vaccinated," said Holetschek.
Federal Health Minister Karl Lauterbach (SPD) has promised that "he will make a proposal to the Health Ministers' Conference as early as next Tuesday." − afp
So I want to send the lamp back
How should I go about it?
Hello, I think the #PRS_ORG# chair is very nice, but I can't see how high the seat is.
Can you help me?
I can no longer shop through my #PRS_ORG#.
Notice: Oops, an error occurred.
Shopping via the #PRS_ORG# website on a computer works.
I have updated my account details.
What could be the reason for this?
What you are describing is referred to as "awareness," or sensory perception while under general anesthesia.
These occur with a frequency of approximately 1 in 1000.
Most commonly, this involves hearing noises/voices, less commonly seeing images, and very rarely experiencing pain.
Relevant to this topic: Caesarean sections are operations which come with an increased rate of awareness as a very deep anaesthetic is avoided to protect the baby until the umbilical cord is cut.
Any previous episodes of awareness should be mentioned during the pre-anaesthetic assessment.
Certain anesthetic techniques, such as total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA), come with a slightly increased risk.
**EDIT: Dear all, this comment of mine describes awareness correctly, however u/Nitemarex by definition had none.
I misread her comment.
But the chair is broken.
Unfortunately, the 20€ doesn't help us either.
These are legal warranty claims.
The absolute minimum would be that they take back the broken chair.
In addition to the legal requirement, this is also standard in the e-commerce sector.
Please check again to see if they will at least take back the broken chair.
We will then sell the second chair privately.
We also lose a lot of money.
I have already sent you an email, which you have not answered.
The question again.
The order and invoice state that the goods will be delivered to a room of my choice.
The freight forwarder is Company #NAME#.
I just called there.
I was told they only deliver to the front door - due to #PRS_ORG#.
Is that so?
If so, I must cancel the order because I do not know anyone who can carry the heavy furniture up to the first floor.
Why won't they call me then?
I had asked a question
Theater historian Günther Rühle has died at the age of 97
He has established himself as a theatre critic and as a director.
Later, he wrote a monumental history of the theater.
On Friday, Günther Rühle died at the age of 97.
The new book is still on the table, hot off the press: "An old man gets older".
The disturbing diary of a slow farewell from the world, which the theater historian and journalist Günther Rühle kept until April 2021.
And in the middle of reading, the news comes that the author has died.
The last sentence in the book reads: "I already give my life thanks here."
There are different types of pallets.
One of the most common are europallets, standardized wooden pallets that are mainly used as cargo carriers in Europe.
They are certified by the European Pallet Association (EPAL)
According to data from Statistics Austria, more than ten million units of pallets were produced in Austria in 2020.
The production value was around 79 million euros.
The number of pallets imported to Austria every year is not recorded
New York win first MLS title
New York City FC has won the Major League Soccer title for the first time.
After the 1-1 in regular time against host Portland Timbers, the team from the Eastern Conference decided the final in the penalty shoot-out with 4:2.
In the Eastern Conference final, New York had beaten Philadelphia Union, the team of German Kai Wagner.
Rouladen Tips & Tricks
I got a lot of great tips here a week ago for the perfect goulash.
It was at Christmas and it was unbelievably delicious and melt-in-your-mouth!
So thank you again for that :)
Now I've got a taste for it and I want to cook rouladen for the first time on New Year's Eve.
Tomorrow, I will make a beef stock for it.
Do you have any other tips for me?
Note: I don't have an oven, just a big pot.
What happens now?
What about my books, or how do I get them back on my #PRS_ORG#?
My English is not as good as it was, but I can manage
It is about a refund of €#NUMBER#.
I was informed by email on 18.01. that the refund had been made.
But to this day, the money has not been paid to me.
Would you please check that?
Where there are still Christmas roasts in the Lübeck area
For many people, goose or duck is as much a part of Christmas as the Christmas tree and presents.
You haven't got your poultry yet?
Now the time is short.
We will tell you where you can still get a Christmas roast in the Lübeck area.
The "drive" of a tube power amplifier contributes significantly to the warmth and "fatness" of the guitar amplifier sound.
These features are perfectly implemented by the Valve Reactor circuit.
With the VOLUME, GAIN, and MASTER VOLUME controls, you can dial in the desired level as well as the amount of distortion in your sounds.
In addition, the VT+ series amps feature a unique POWER LEVEL control that allows you to reduce the sound level without changing the "gain" or the distortion.
Further up, it was already mentioned that with the POWER LEVEL controller, you can even make a power reserve available quickly, if it gets unashamedly loud.
Thanks to the POWER LEVEL adjuster, the full potential of the VT+ series can be used in every situation.
The headphone jack can also be used as a line output.
The signal attached here is processed with a speaker simulation, so that you get an eminent "acoustic" sound impression even when using headphones or direct recordings.
A CD or MP3 player can be connected to the AUX port, so you can jam to your favorite songs.
A tuner function is also on board - so you don't need a separate tuner.
Anyone who adds a VFS5 footswitch can also call up the sounds conveniently by foot, switch the effect blocks on/off, and "tap" the tempo of effects that are compatible in this regard.
This is actually indispensable for live use.
With its new power packages, VOX is taking another step into the future!
But I had seen that with others.
Is there then the possibility to return the lamp?
Because it is too low to hang over a dining table?
So, I'd like to send them back.
Can you help me with that?
And what about the chest of drawers?
Will we get another update on the exact delivery date in the coming weeks?
Hello, have you ever sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs?
If it doesn't work, I'd also be happy with a discount or a voucher.
In some cases, I find a buyer for the furniture.
Over 1,000 euros for goods that I don't need is a bit much.
I just received my delivery and would have liked to know if screws were included as part of the delivery.
I would like to install the #PRS_ORG# mirror (door) on the designated hook.
That is not a satisfactory answer and the wait was not worth it
Do you have a premium customer status?
Iran sees progress in talks on nuclear deal
According to Iranian sources, progress is being made in the negotiations over the revival of the international nuclear agreement.
"Both sides are on the verge of reaching an agreement on the issues to be on the agenda," Iran's chief negotiator Ali Bagheri told the Iranian news agency Irna on Sunday.
This is a "positive and important development" because at first there was not even agreement on the topics to be negotiated.
The agreement is supposed to prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons.
On Thursday, the Vienna talks to revive the agreement were resumed after a nearly one-week break.
Representatives from Iran, Germany, Britain, China, France and Russia are taking part in the talks.
A US delegation is also present in Vienna, but is only indirectly involved in the negotiations.
Thuringia surpasses Saxony - Free state now federal state with the highest Corona incidence
Thuringia has taken over from Saxony and currently has the highest incidence rate in the country.
As the only federal state, the value is above the mark of 1000.
Thuringia was the only federal state to have an incidence rate of more than 1000 on Sunday.
The Robert Koch Institute gave the seven-day value with 1,025 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants.
In Saxony, which has always had the highest incidence rate in the country, this value was 990.5 on Sunday.
On Friday and Saturday, the incidence in Thuringia was slightly reduced, but was also above the value of 1000.
In Thuringia, 2242 new infections with the Sars-CoV-2 virus and 16 additional deaths in connection with an infection were reported within one day.
On Sunday, 200 people severely ill with Covid-19 were being treated in hospitals in intensive care units.
On weekends, there may be delays in registration.
In addition, health departments have been overwhelmed for weeks and can barely keep up with the registration of new cases.
I understand that.
As the delivery is not until the beginning of March, it might be possible by then.
I have to print it and stick it on the package and drop it off at the post office, right?
Do I have to click/specify/fill out anything else here?
That is exactly what I want to avoid, which is why I am writing to you.
I would like to pay for the return at my own expense, please.
In my opinion, the €8 return fee is an insult.
It's time for change
###Greetings Bundestag, I'm u/StratorDE in the plenary hall in the heart of Europe on a fantastic day!
#Why is the post here?
If one takes a look at the activity of the Bundestag in the past few months, one thing becomes clear: it does not exist.
We have entered a winter slump and extended the summer lull for a few months.
#Where is the problem?
Yes, what was the reason?
Mostly, it's probably just down to the dissatisfaction with how some things have gone here and how we stand in general.
In recent days, there has been a growing impression that many people here really still want the Bundestag.
#What we need to change
At this point the community around the German Bundestag is being asked, which wants to keep it alive.
The impetus came from u/edizVEVO, who became aware of this project in the last few days and found, to put it simply, a mess.
After some back and forth writing, several people from the community have found each other who are interested in rebuilding the project.
However, I would also like to call on all of you once again to participate, only in this way can this project continue to exist in the future.
To this end, we have created a discussion platform in the form of a Discord server, where we can exchange ideas with each other, as well as work out concrete things.
You can join the server via this link.
Goals:
* How should the Bundestag function in the future?
* What existing orders need to be changed/amended/removed?
* How do we want to present ourselves to the outside world in the future?
* How will new members be recruited?
* How do we create a fair voting system?
I'm pretty sure I've forgotten some things, but that's okay, we have the Discord at the end.
If you have time and are interested, come to the Discord, work with us and let's decide democratically about the future.
I have ordered a lampshade from you that is yet to be delivered.
Now I see that the article is too large/clumsy for it and not suitable for my taste.
For this reason, I have already ordered a different suspension from you.
I put it together and then noticed it when I took the soft foam.
Very sad about it.
I hope that this is returned and I get a full refund.
This is also quite sad, as the #NAME# is much darker than expected.
I have another question: the day blanket #PRS_ORG#, does it also come in a larger size, such as 240/240 for example?
#PRS_ORG# must be able to guarantee that the faulty cupboard will be picked up in a timely manner.
And I ask you to make that happen now.
I don't have suitable packaging, but I will disassemble the cupboard as far as possible for pick-up - they must clarify with #PRS_ORG# how this can work.
#PRS_ORG# can call me at any time to arrange a collection date.
Is there an installation guide?
How long would I have to get them or decide to return them?
How do you answer the question as to why you are vegan?
Today, I had a conversation with a colleague that I like.
She herself used to live as a vegetarian for a while and probably only eats meat very rarely now.
I myself was also a vegetarian for several years.
When asked if I had always wanted to be vegan, and if vegetarianism was a planned interim step, I answered honestly, without much thought.
That I thought for a long time that by being a vegetarian, I would be supporting animal welfare, but at some point, I reflected and understood that I was ultimately also supporting animal abuse.
Therefore, my decision to become vegan.
In that moment I had the impression that discontent was arising on her side, she then defended vegetarianism and said she knew where her meat came from and that as a vegetarian you reduce animal suffering.
Now I wonder if my answer was too "blunt"?
How does she answer the question?
I feel like as a vegan, you're quickly put into a corner and conflicts arise without you wanting them to.
A harmony-loving vegan greets you (;
This is clearly not an exception under section 312d of the German Civil Code.
Your #PRS_ORG# does not exempt you from the legal requirements for distance selling.
I am not at the designated date #PRS_ORG# is picking up my return.
Since I cannot be there because of a funeral, this cannot be changed, unfortunately.
I would like to be assigned an alternative pick-up date, please.
As of 01.02.#NUMBER#, I will once again be available on an ongoing basis.
Lahnsteiner Wehr equipped for water rescue: 45,000 Euro grant from the state
Recently, the Rhineland-Palatinate Minister of the Interior, Roger Lewentz, presented a grant in the amount of 45,000 euros for the new water rescue vehicle of the Lahnstein Volunteer Fire Department to Mayor Peter Labonte at the Lahnstein Town Hall.
The total cost of the vehicle, which has been in use since November 2020, was €135,000.
A good and important investment in security.
I am pleased that the state of Rhineland-Palatinate is supporting us here," says Lahnsteins mayor, Peter Labonte.
The appliance wagon is used by the Lahnstein diving squad, one of a total of seven units in Rhineland-Palatinate.
Above and below the water, they perform tasks in water and ice rescue as well as technical assistance.
In Lahnstein, people are permanently expecting more and more calls: The boom of hotel shipping on the Rhine and Mosel, as well as the further increasing use of the Lahn as a leisure river, contribute to this.
I bought a book that I could only read 10% of and then the problems started.
I can't open the book.
I have followed their recommendations but have synchronised, removed and re-loaded the app - NOTHING has worked.
I'm a bit frustrated because the whole thing has already cost me a lot of time, and now I'm hoping for help.
Okay, that's how it is.
I would like to order 3 items from the #PRS_ORG# collection for June.
Can I enter a date in the ordering process?

Thank you first of all for standing up to the whole thing here, I have also spent almost a decade in public service in a similar role, i.e. we were also armed members of the executive, I don't want to go into that any further!
I always find the question of right and left to be very simplified.
Generally speaking, one should say that, of course, the state servant comes from the liberal to conservative spectrum and not from the revolutionary left, which should be clear to everyone.
Of course, it should also be clear to everyone that these people will naturally have a hard time dealing with the lived reality if they are attracted to the right of conservative magic. This is clear, because, in addition to the average white person, there are now many Germans with a migration background, women, and also homosexuals (and by this I do not mean the over-the-top feminine stereotype of a gay person, because there are hardly any of those in the executive, but rather normal men and women who do not show it unless they tell you about it) and I can and must also rely on these people, because in doubt, they will save your life or put it on the line for you.
But even these fringe groups represent a conservative attitude, in my experience, i.e. they are proud of Germany and feel less included by exaggerated left-wing politics, even though this politics is supposedly on their side or claims to do so. They just want to be treated normally.
Going back to the right-wingers, since, of course, the police and armed forces are also a cross-section of society, you will also find extreme right-wingers there. However, the fact that these people are allowed to openly express their opinion or even openly plot any state-endangering plans is completely exaggerated by the media and also annoys me.
Of course, it happens that even police officers and soldiers, who have often been deployed abroad, start to generalise and sometimes say things that are controversial or politically incorrect due to negative experiences.
It also happens that right-wing sympathizers meet and have a lively exchange of ideas.
However, I think that this kind of thing is well fought against, and political education and enlightenment are used against it!
Germany is so deeply international, and I think that's a good thing that we can't afford to have real racists and Nazis in our ranks!
Yes, what I don't understand is that I also ordered the other basket on the German side.
Why should it come from England?
When I ordered, it wasn't sold out.
I ordered in November already.
but it was confirmed to me in your order confirmation
It is still about my order, which is no longer available.
I was chatting with #NAME# before.
Alternatively, one could have the other #PRS_ORG# basket for #NUMBER# euros in black delivered to Germany, or is this basket also available somewhere in Germany.
I can only ever find you as a partner company.
but at the top edge of the wooden part, there are two deep grooves which have been filled with something yellow
And there is a small scratch on the mirror itself.
Normal for a child?
Hi, I (w32) have been concerned about something for a while.
I'm very disciplined and organised at work (I'm self-employed, with very little leisure time), but for as long as I can remember, I've struggled to keep my home permanently clean and tidy.
There are always phases in which everything remains as it is, and then every now and then it gets to me and I tidy up and clean.
But it's actually never "that someone could drop by spontaneously."
My husband is also (unfortunately) not better, it bothers me somewhere but usually the household simply loses out against work and lack of enthusiasm.
The kitchen is cleaned most regularly because we like to cook.
Now to my question, have you managed to be more orderly with your child?
We don't have one yet, but we're working on it and this question has been on my mind for a long time.
Because for me, I have no motivation, it simply doesn't bother me that much, as long as there are no visitors and, for example, there is always fresh clothes available and the kitchen is usable.
Does having a child give you a greater incentive or do you stay sloppy?
I look forward to your answers.
An exclusive, new, high-quality and anatomically pre-shaped cut offers maximum comfort, a perfect fit and thus almost unrestricted freedom of movement.
Pre-shaping with special, further pressing at the joints for improved freedom of movement (for arm and knee bends)
For the Focea Comfort 4, the area covered by the Flex System 2 was more than doubled to further increase comfort.
Seamless stretch panels at the joints reduce friction (armpits, arm and knee bends)
High-quality pre-shaping in the lower back area and in the crotch provide a close-fitting, perfect fit.
Elaskin 8.8 stretch panel in the lumbar area increases flexibility around the back zip to improve comfort, especially when bending and when donning and doffing equipment on the surface.
The Free Flex Zone around the shoulders and back guarantees increased flexibility when moving your arms and back.
Fireskin is a heat-insulating, water-resistant material with a special surface structure that provides a high degree of cold protection.
When placed on the chest, it brings warmth to a sensitive area of the body.
Seamless, thin (-2 mm) sealing at the face on the hood increases comfort, seal, and durability (separate head hood)
A soft, collar-based zone improves the seal with a fine-adjustable width adjustment by means of a flexible, gentle hook-and-loop fastener, which does not stick to the lining or to the seams
Zippered double cuffs at the wrists and ankles connect a fold-back inner cuff to a soft, fleece-lined neoprene outer cuff.
45° notch at the end of the inner cuff for increased elasticity and durability when putting on.
Long zip at the back of the neck with an elastane reinforcement, for an anatomical cut with increased comfort on the overall without a hood
Long G-Lock P back zip (overall without hood) with metal slider and integrated Water Dam System for improved waterproofing (Beuchat patent)
Zippers on arms and legs
Neoprene reinforcement at all ends of the zips to prevent ripping if too much force is applied.
Neoprene panels butt-welded with outer and inner overlap
Edges of the outer cuffs lined for greater durability
Edges of the inner cuff are notched for increased flexibility
The original Beuchat system was designed to fix the computer in place, especially during deeper dives (the system is compatible with all common wrist-mounted computers)
A career in social work - as someone with an insecure personality disorder?
I did a training in software development and I have been qualified for about a year now.
Unfortunately, I'm increasingly realising that this job isn't right for me, which is why I've been thinking for some time about starting again and studying social work.
The problem: I have a self-conscious (or anxious-avoidant) personality disorder (SCPD).
That means roughly speaking that I have no self-esteem and am therefore shy.
I have no problem talking to people on a professional level, but it is very hard for me to have casual conversations and I've been told many times that I come off as unapproachable (which I think I've gotten better at).
Can I become a social worker this way?
I don't want to work as a streetworker or in an open youth centre, but rather in, for example, addiction counselling or family assistance.
But I do not know if the actual working day is really like I imagine it to be, and it is difficult to find anything about it on the Internet.
The AVPS is already causing me problems (for me, emotionally) in my job because it drags me down every time there's something to complain about my code ("messed up the simplest things again") and it's hard for me to ask more experienced colleagues for help ("I should really know how to do this by now"/"I'm holding him back from his work with my stupid questions"/"he must think I'm really incompetent" etc.).
I'll probably have problems in every job, but I wanted to mention it here.
But you did get the sofa back, didn’t you?
Because there was no confirmation for that either.
I'm waiting for an appointment for collection
What do they mean by please return!
If I download a book on the #PRS_ORG# I get the message Your #PRS_ORG# doesn't authorize this book
Is there a problem with that?
I was in chat with #PRS_ORG who asked if I had a delivery confirmation for my cupboard.
The protein from the food is broken down in the bird's digestive tract into individual protein building blocks (amino acids), which the bird then uses to build its own body proteins, which it also needs for feather formation.
The formation of plumage in nestlings and the regrowth of feathers in moulting birds are extremely complex processes and are associated with a particularly high strain on the overall organism of the animal.
Please note that NEKTON-Bio should not be administered during breeding, as this can lead to disturbances in the hatching process.
Following this course of treatment with NEKTON-Bio, the daily vitamin supply with NEKTON-S (multivitamin supplement) and NEKTON-MSA (mineral supplement) should be resumed.
The bird breaks down the protein taken in with the feed in its gastrointestinal tract into the individual protein building blocks (amino acids) and builds its own body proteins from these, which it also needs for feather formation.

Following this course of treatment with NEKTON-Bio, the daily vitamin supply with NEKTON-S (multivitamin supplement) and NEKTON-MSA (mineral supplement) should be resumed.
1 g of NEKTON-Bio to 250 ml of water or 100 g of soft food.
Only as much drinking water/soft food should be prepared as the bird consumes daily, and water/food should be changed daily.
A painted measuring spoon (included) equals 1 g of NEKTON-Bio.
In the case of severe feather damage, double or triple the dose of NEKTON-Bio can be given at the beginning until the start of new feather growth is visible.
After that, the normal dose is given until the feather regrowth is complete.
Storage: NEKTON-Bio should be stored dry, out of direct sunlight, between 15° and 25°C.
Please excuse us, but the chair is sold as an office chair.
How can an office chair break after 9 months?
Warranty claims in Germany are 24 months.
That's really bad service.
Hi, I sent an email on Monday to let you know that my order arrived damaged and pictures were attached.
Did you receive this email?
Statement of a community worker in opposition to the statute
Hi r/LegaladviceGerman,
I have the following problem.
A walnut tree is to be cut down on our property.
So they filed a felling application to the municipality.
An employee writes to me that cutting down fruit trees, and thus also the walnut tree, is not part of the regulations.
However, in the by-laws the walnut is explicitly specified as a tree to be protected.
Can I rely on the employee's statement or not?
On the one hand, I must be able to rely on an expert opinion.
On the other hand, the by-laws are clear.
Thanks for the answers
We understand that.
Then we'll use the new packaging for it.
I have not received a message
Well, then I still have a sofa without use.
Could you offer me a discount or a voucher?
What was more expensive?
Yes, I believe so, but the question is, whether I can pay in Euros and have the blanket delivered to Germany.
Can you check that?
Breaking news: Heavy traffic accident in Selb
Recently, a serious traffic accident occurred on the St 2179 between the Selb-Nord junction and Plößberg.
According to the current police press release (14:03), a car came into the oncoming traffic while overtaking.
There are injured people.
Ah, okay, I understand.
That's good, so thank you again for making it so easy!
Advice and ideas for further professional life
First of all, Merry Christmas to you!
My Christmas is unfortunately not very good, because my dear head is currently destroying everything that one can think about.
Before I go on now ... in short: I need advice and preferably from people who somehow know my situation - so from you.
I'm currently doing the Ref as a late starter.
I originally studied and worked in a different field (to remain at least somewhat anonymous, I won't mention anything more specific here).
However, the whole thing was too boring for me, and I looked for alternatives that would be more fun for me.
At some point, I ended up teaching, and I was sure that it was it - even though the framework conditions are significantly less flexible than in my previous job, but I didn't care.
I am now at the third "I Google other job postings".
And it has only been half a year.
I always decide to keep going with the Malen before, and at least end the Ref, then I can always switch later.
But right now, I'm absolutely exhausted.
I've had so little free time this month that I'm completely run down.
Now it's the holidays, but there is still a lot of work waiting for me.
Before the referee, I always thought I was stress-resistant, but there my weekend was my weekend and my evening off was my evening off.
I was free at that time.
And the stress at work didn't matter in those moments.
Now, even a family celebration is too much stress for me.
And then there are these rigid structures that get on my nerves even more.
Basically it's fun, and from the outside, it looks like the ref is doing a good job, in terms of feedback and so forth.
But I'm completely exhausted and wonder how much stress my body can take before it completely shuts down - if it isn't already doing so.
I wonder whether I want to have this for the rest of my working life - especially when I read some of your posts here - or whether I should go back to the old area, where I was valued, could take time off when I needed it, and even though I found the work a bit boring, I was paid adequately and worked together in a team, rather than as a lone fighter, as is the case most of the time now.
But then I wonder if I'll be back in the same place a year from now and unhappy.
You can tell that it is all a bit of a mess, but maybe you, as an outsider, have some advice or ideas on how I can get out of this situation, where I'm completely finished and start to cry at the mere thought of it.
I'm not going to make decisions emotionally now, that probably won't lead to anything good.
But perhaps your views will help me to at least see some light at the end of the tunnel - or to be able to enjoy Christmas, which is enough for me for now.
Thanks for reading, and sorry for the whiny undertone from me.
I hope my situation has at least become a little clearer.
Since its introduction in 2001, the VOX Valvetronix series has evolved steadily, including the combination of the advanced modeling technology with the "Valve Reactor" circuit, which perfectly imitates the behavior of a tube amplifier.
With the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X amps, we introduce a brand new modeling engine, which is absolutely state-of-the-art in terms of sound.
Thanks to the VET (Virtual Element Technology), which is based on the analysis of the parts and the amp circuits, the VTX amplifiers offer an authenticity that is absolutely impressive.
Of course, these amps also contain the multi-stage Valvetronix valve preamp.
This is partly based on real analog circuits, because these get the sound variations and nuances of a tube amplifier simply better than any simulation.
In addition to this sophisticated circuit, the VTX amplifiers offer a closed cabinet and a bass reflex system from which the natural resonances just flow.
With the VOX "Tone Room" software, you can even correct and distort historical facts on a virtual level, until the amp and effects sound the way you've always imagined them.
The perfect combination of tube sound with modeling technology is first and foremost due to the VOX Valve Reactor technology introduced in 2001.
Of course, it has been refined several times since then to meet new sound requirements, which in 2010 again led to a performance boost of the VOX Valvetronix series - with more dynamics as well as numerous and significantly improved amplifier models.
From the handy VT20+ up to the VT120+ with two speakers, the new VT+ Valvetronix series has been designed so that all guitarists looking for maximum sound variety will find what they are looking for.
All guitarists dream of the pressure and dynamics of a tube amplifier: they expect a fat sound, a nuanced reproduction of playing dynamics and string attack, and a prompt response.
During an in-depth analysis, VOX engineers discovered that the power amplifier in particular determines the tube-like character of an amplifier and developed the VOX Valve Reactor technology based on this finding.
Each VT+-amplifier's Valve Reactor circuit, which is equipped with a 12AX7 tube, perfectly recreates the behaviour, subtle nuances and sound character of a tube amplifier.
NBA: Despite 20 points from Wagner: Magic lose at Clippers
The Orlando Magic's losing streak in the NBA continues.
The Wagner brothers can shine - but it's not enough to win against the Los Angeles Clippers.
Despite 20 points from Franz Wagner and seven points from his older brother Moritz, the Magic lost 104:106 to the Los Angeles Clippers on Saturday.
The large main compartment is also adaptable: with three individually placed and foldable Velcro dividers, it can be adjusted to suit your photographic needs and is suitable for all types of cameras - from mirrorless system cameras of all sizes to full-frame DSLR cameras.
What ultimately fits in the backpack depends, of course, on the size of the camera and the lenses.
A possible loadout would be a DSLR camera with a mounted lens, two to three interchangeable lenses, and a hot-shoe flash.
Larger DSLM cameras like the various models of the Sony a7 series or a Fuji X-T2 leave room for additional lenses.
In addition, you can store a lot of accessories.
And if you have a small DSLM camera (MFT cameras from Olympus, Fujifilm X-A or E-series) you can use the backpack for your equipment and for non-photographic things.
Drone pilots are also making an optimal choice with the Everyday Backpack 20L, as the backpack offers enough space for a DJI Mavic Pro including remote control and accessories.
Volcano eruption on La Palma: probably the longest in history
In the just under three months since the outbreak began, the lava flows on the Canary Island have caused great damage.
Is an end in sight?
With a duration of now 85 days, the volcanic eruption on La Palma has been the longest in the known history of the Spanish Canary Island since Sunday.
So far, the eruption of the Tehuya volcano in 1585 with 84 days was considered the longest on the Atlantic island off the west coast of Africa.
There are no reliable data on previous eruptions.
Although the activity of the still unnamed volcano in Cumbre Vieja has decreased in recent days, volcanologists still did not dare to predict when it could end.
The indicators point to a slowdown.
The best news is that they are stable," the president of the island council, Mariano Hernández Zapata, told the state TV channel RTVE.
Damage in the millions
In the nearly three months since the outbreak began, more than 1,000-degree-hot lava has destroyed almost 2,900 homes and other buildings, RTVE reported.
Just under 1,200 hectares were covered by a meter-thick layer of lava.
That is almost equivalent to 1700 football fields.
More than 7,000 residents had to be evacuated, and the damage is estimated at more than 900 million euros.
Two new land protrusions were created off the coast by cooled lava, with a combined size of about 50 hectares.
Banana cultivation, which is immensely important for the island and from which about half of the approximately 85,000 inhabitants live directly or indirectly, was particularly hard hit. It was already in a crisis before the volcanic eruption.
225 hectares of banana plantations were destroyed, and further areas were heavily affected, wrote the newspaper "El País".
Christmas and the presents
Christmas is just around the corner and especially the children will hardly be able to wait for the heavenly festival.
The many colourful gifts under the Christmas tree, combined with the spiritual atmosphere and the crackling tension, have something alluring about them.
Christmas is one of the few traditional occasions that can still hold our increasingly divided society together.
It is all the more important to be aware of the Christmas tradition of giving, so that the act of giving, which, according to the French sociologist and ethnologist Marcel Mauss, was a peace-promoting "social contract of primitive peoples," can escape the rigid routine and be brought back to life in the context of this tradition.
How St. Nicholas became the Christ Child
Strictly speaking, it was the Protestants who linked the Christmas days closely with gift-giving.
Earlier, on St. Nicholas' Day, gifts were exchanged in one way or another.
The background to this still popular custom is that Saint Nicholas, as Bishop of Myra, secretly threw gold into the windows of three women one night to save them from a life of sin.
This unconventional way of giving rise to the popular German practice of filling children's boots with gifts.
Protestants found this practice offensive, because they reject the veneration of intercessors between God and men as "idolatry".
For these reasons, they are opposed to the institution.
Martin Luther turned Saint Nicholas into the Christ Child and thus founded a new tradition.
The focus of gift-giving thus shifted to Christmas Eve.
Since most Protestants do not see such detailed questions in such a narrow way, it only annoys the fewest people that the custom of Saint Nicholas, like the Martin custom with Martin songs and Martin's procession, is still an integral part of the pre-Christmas season.
Today, you can find everything from socks to coveted luxury watches in front of the door and under the Christmas tree.
Diversity of traditions in Christian countries
Sources indicate a tradition of gift-giving on the day of Saint Nicholas since the 13th century.
With the Reformation, the day of giving shifted to Christmas Eve.
In all Christian countries, however, there is a happy muddle over the question of who brings the gifts to the children.
In Germany, it depends on the region whether Christkind appears on Christmas Eve or Santa Claus, who in principle is a kind of St. Nicholas, to whom some characteristics have been assigned over time.
These include his white beard, which has little in common with the more strict Assyrian beard of the historical figure, his sleigh pulled by reindeer, and his preference for the chimney to gain access to the houses.
In the Netherlands, Saint Nicholas remains the central figure on Christmas.
In Spain, it is the Three Wise Men who give the gifts, while in Italy, it is the witch Befana who is said to have guided them to the baby Jesus.
In Scandinavia, it is sometimes mythical creatures that bring the gifts, while in Russia, Father Frost brought some fame.
Here it is not reindeer, but three horses that pull his sleigh as a troika.
In the Czech Republic, the motherland of the Reformation in the course of the Hussite Wars, the Christ Child is responsible for delivering the gifts.

Police shoot suspected bank robber near King's Palace
An armed man was shot dead by police on Saturday near Kensington Palace in London.
Police said callers reported a man walking into a bank and a bookmaker's shop with a gun.
The man fled in a vehicle, according to authorities, which was stopped by officers a short time later.
Shots were fired and the man was hit.
He was pronounced dead at the scene.
The police did not assume a terrorist background.
There are several embassies in the area around Kensington Palace.
The palace is the official London residence of Prince William, his wife Catherine, and their three children.
Other members of the royal family also live there.
Which ones?
No matter where I click, I am immediately directed to your page.
The decorative light fits harmoniously into every bed, garden area or rock garden.
The light is simply set up and can be anchored in the ground with two earth spikes.
Integrated and powerful 0.4 watt solar module for optimal charging of the built-in battery.
Burning time max. 10 hours.
- The robust plastic construction is suitable for outdoor use all year round.
In Hollywood spectacles, it is usually threatening objects from distant galaxies that glow with internal colours.
"Smart Stone", on the other hand, is completely harmless: the sun alone ensures that this solar light shines fascinatingly - optionally in white or coloured light (in six different colour tones).
The edge-less, amorphous design is deliberately chosen: Like a naturally formed large pebble, this modern light object presents itself during the day.
Its organic curves fit in every natural environment - whether on the edge of the terrace, in the lawn or in the rock garden.
It also does well in the company of larger pebbles and boulders, where its size allows it to hold its own.
You can save yourself a lot of preliminary work: As a solar light, "Smart Stone" does not need a connection or batteries.
Place the 'beacon' in any sunny place during the day.
Two included earth pegs ensure a firm hold if necessary.
The matt-white plastic shell itself is robust and weather-resistant.
Its solar panel discreetly hides the "Smart Stone" inside, along with its battery and two LEDs - one for white light and the other for colored light.
The battery charges when sunlight hits the case.
At dusk, "Smart Stone" begins to light up on its own; in which color, you decide for yourself: In addition to daylight white, you have six attractive light colours to choose from.
Switching off also happens automatically as soon as the battery charge has dropped to a predefined minimum or it gets light again.
Once the sun shines again, the charging cycle starts all over again the next day.
I've done this multiple times and it doesn't work.
It's a shame, I would have liked to continue ordering from you, but if the voucher is not credited to me, then I will not order from you out of principle.
If you change your mind, let me know.
Otherwise, today was the last contact.

The motor control of the LokSound 5 has been fundamentally improved once again.
A variable PWM clock frequency from 10kHz to 50kHz ensures super-quiet operation, especially for bell-armature motors – the typical "humming" is a thing of the past.
The load regulation can now be adapted to difficult cases with up to 10 CVs.
The unique "Autotune" feature allows the decoder to automatically match the motor.
The LokSound 5 decoder delivers up to 1.5A of motor current, which is enough juice even for older motors.

The pill problem
Hello dear ladies,
I hope I'm doing everything right here, it's actually my first post after a year on reddit.
To my problem: About five years ago, I reluctantly started taking the pill again, mainly because I had incredibly bad pain during my period and terrible PMS before my period.
Now I would like to keep it that way, because I already have to take enough medication for my chronic illnesses, which I cannot choose myself.
My main problem, surprisingly not the pain, but my skin.
I went from 0 to 100 with explosions of acne during my last two-year break and it was everywhere.
So far so superficial, but it really got to me and I didn't feel comfortable.
In the two-year pause, things have never really normalised.
Maybe someone has some tips to avoid this time.
My cosmetics are already fragrance-free and without frills, but perhaps there is something that someone can recommend to me.
Unfortunately, my gynecologist didn't take me seriously, and I still haven't got an appointment with a dermatologist.
Many thanks to everyone who read the novel!
Yes, skin is such a thing.
Had a bad case of atopic dermatitis, then a time of peace, then a large-scale nodule lichen, and the acne issue.
I have also tried all kinds of things in relation to my chronic illness, and I have settled on a diet low in sugar, milk and meat, because nothing else has worked very well.
It could also be that hormonally the worm is in there, but if you have a construction site everywhere like me, you don't really want to go and look for what else is wrong.
I already had everything of her colleague semina, etc.
Written and now I have lost the conversation and don't know what was replied to my request.
I have to work in between and answer the phone, and suddenly everything was gone...
what is there to check, if the money was there, I would have seen it
Please check my bank details, maybe there was something wrong
but does it exist at all in large sizes?
because it is widely available in black.

In the name of the people: Lay judges pass sentence
In the courtroom, they are sitting on the judge's bench in everyday clothing.
But a lot depends on their judgment, even if they don't wear robes: Juries, together with professional judges, decide whether and for how long someone goes behind bars.
Two of them speak to the "Oeffentlichen" about their time at the Bad Kreuznach District Court: Sascha Wickert from Boos and Ruth Ertz from Bad Kreuznach are two of the 125 lay judges at the District Court on John F. Kennedy Street.
Hello, unfortunately I can't get into my customer account.
Could you please resend the invoice for order number #NUMBER# to the email address above?
Can we get rid of the packaging material?
We have no means to keep them for so long.
We would use the table as offered, as if it were ours.
Yes, I had already ordered and received the same chair in blue in November. Since they are so beautiful, I would now like to have one in grey.
Does the cupboard have to be completely dismantled for collection and return?
and when would it be picked up?
The 110-kV underground cable will be newly built in 2022
The approval for the relocation of the new high-voltage cable in Tann is legally binding.
The plan approval decision of the government of Lower Bavaria clears the way for construction, which is scheduled to begin in 2022.
This was announced by the network operator Bayernwerk.
The approximately seven kilometre long underground cable will connect the Tann switching station in the north of the municipality and the existing 110-kilovolt line between Simbach and Pfarrkirchen.
The cable will be connected to a pylon of the high-voltage line near the town of Edermanning near Reut.
Good morning,
My order from 03.01.21 with the order number #NUMBER# has only arrived in part.
The blue Betsell number #PRS_ORG# with the delivery number #NUMBER# was returned by #PRS_ORG# with the note "Delivery not possible".
The other three packages have arrived, so delivery is definitely possible.
Can you tell me what the next step is?
Have a great start to the week!
You can forget that, I explained that several times yesterday!!
This is a glass chest of drawers and the whole side has burst open, so there's glass everywhere and the box is broken.
The chest of drawers is in my apartment and #PRS_ORG# refuses to come into the apartment because of the #PRS_ORG# regulations
This means the chest of drawers cannot be collected as no-one is allowed into my flat
Thank you for the message
But why only 20 euros?
The original value of this chair was #NUMBER# EUR
No, it is with all books, that's why the request to #PRS_ORG#, as it seems to be a general problem.
Ref: planning lessons (EK)
Hello dear colleagues,
I've been in the ref since the summer; I enjoy teaching, but I'm currently having a lot of trouble planning my geography lessons in an efficient way.
Unfortunately, my school is not technically well-equipped at all, so I can basically only use the blackboard, the school book, and an overhead projector as a medium.
In school, I can only copy s/w for free (which is annoying for geography).
I currently need a lot of time to plan my hours.
For example, we're currently working on the topic of geofactors, and for me, each hour stands on its own.
In essence, the methods are always repeated, but on the other hand, I also don't want to spend too much time on simple lessons (which I also need for UBs, etc.).
I actually always start my planning with the learning goal (what do I want to achieve) and then think about how I can build it up (usually I create a worksheet with texts from books that my school doesn't have).
We have the book Terra, and with most of the problems in the book I am rather dissatisfied.
This is why the worksheets as well.
Maybe a geography teacher can tell me how to work efficiently with the book.
I'd be really pleased.
I would like to return the #PRS_ORG# from order #NUMBER#.
I have actually already decided on a new one at #PRS_ORG#, but I would like to process the return as soon as possible.
The trade is concerned about Christmas business due to the 2G regulation.
Only those who have been vaccinated or have recovered can enter most shops.
The trade considers this unnecessary and complains of sales declines.
He also has a possible solution ready.
From the perspective of the German Trade Association (HDE), the 2G regulations are ruining the important Christmas business for the retail sector.
When it comes to business with items of non-daily necessity, there is a drop in sales to be lamented, criticized Stefan Genth, CEO of the HDE.
According to a recent HDE survey of 1,100 merchants, more than 70 percent of companies had a negative outlook for the rest of the year.
Many had already written off the Christmas business.
"What was actually supposed to be the positive highlight of the year is now often a bottomless pit," said Genth.
Dealers with 2G access restrictions lost around one third of their pre-crisis sales in the past week.
Things are only going well in the food retail sector as well as in the online area.
The association demanded consequences from the dramatic development.
Shopping with mask, distance and hygiene concept is a safe matter, said the chief executive.
"2G when shopping does not help us in the fight against the pandemic," he stressed.
The current regulations deterred customers and required a lot of manpower.
He called for a nationwide approval of the wristband regulation.
After that, each customer would only need to be checked once for 2G (vaccinated or recovered) and would have access to all shops on that day with the bracelet they received.
In addition, random checks should be sufficient in retail - as is already the case in public transport with the 3G rule (vaccinated, recovered or tested).
The real estate group Deutsche Euroshop, which specializes in shopping centres, also spoke of a difficult Christmas business.
The frequencies last stood at around 75 percent of the pre-Corona level without 2G, and the turnover at around 90 percent.
These figures will now certainly fall in the middle of the all-important Christmas business", said CEO Wilhelm Wellner to "Wirtschaftswoche".
Due to the high personnel and administrative effort, solutions are being sought and approved for the centres.
This includes the so-called wristband solution, in which "visitors, for example, provide their 2G proof at a central point in the centre and then - equipped with a wristband similar to that in a club hotel - can visit all the shops without interruption". dpa
I recently ordered and received the #PRS_ORG#.
The mirror has a scratch, and the frame also has a mistake, which was attempted to be covered up with a yellow filler.
It looks ugly.
I would like to return the mirror and have already put it back in the package and sealed it.
How do I proceed now for the return?
The lamp is designed for dual-balance, based on new, flat, high-power, high-CRI SMD LEDs.
A modern microprocessor with exceptional capabilities is responsible for setting the colour temperature and brightness of the lamp.
In addition to adjusting the brightness, there are two standard colour temperatures: daylight and artificial light.
It is also possible to set and save the color temperature manually within the range of 3100 - 5650K.
Use the current settings in Flash memory.
A special feature of the controller is that it is easy to use and intuitive.
The luminaire generates a very high light output with soft light of high quality, entirely flicker-free.
The 120-degree beam angle, which allows you to light up large areas from a relatively short distance, is excellent.
Incidentally, also in reporter situations in small rooms or at short distances.
They can adjust the brightness virtually without changing the colour temperature.
It's a great tool to work with whether you're on a film set or in a studio.
The optional DMX512 controller allows for remote control of the light in television studios or when the light is mounted in hard-to-reach places.
The control panel is at the back of the light, it consists of buttons and a backlit display.
The display shows the current brightness setting in percent and the current color temperature in Kelvin.
Furthermore, there is a slot for the NP-F batteries (not included)
User memory The memory has up to three panel settings for brightness and colour temperature.
To set the individual settings on the memory slots, simply press and hold one of the memory buttons and that's it.
The memory controller stores the current state of the lamp when it is turned off, so that when it is turned on again, the familiar situation is restored - very practical for studio work when, for example, the camera is set to specific colour temperatures.
Working with a battery, one of the major strengths of the DL3120 functionality comes from the ability to operate with inexpensive NP-F batteries.
These are often already owned by photographers and camera people (and women) - so you can tap into existing equipment.
The DL3120 can also check if the batteries have enough power before you set it - it has a built-in battery tester - for each of the two battery compartments a value in the two display indicators (the left battery upper display, the right on the lower display).
In addition, it is of course possible to continuously supply the headlight with power using the supplied power supply.
The construction of the headlight is very simple.
They have a 16mm sleeve for fastening, so you can attach them directly to your camera tripod.
The angle is reliably set using stops on both sides.
Care was taken to ensure that the mechanical components are also of extremely high quality, and therefore designed for durability and heavy use.
In addition, a tilt joint is included in the package.
Great that a bag is also included in the package.
This way, you can transport or store the light with all the accessories that you may want to buy without any problems.
It's a pity, I got it as a gift and it's too small :(
"The party we wanted to throw": Frankfurt celebrates after a goal-rich comeback against Leverkusen
What a spectacular reaction from Eintracht Frankfurt.
After 22 minutes, the last two times in a row, the last two times in a row, the last two times in a row, the last two times in a row, the last two times in a row, the last two times in a row, the last two times in a row, the last two times in a row, the last two times in a row, the last two times in a row, the last two times in a row, the last two times in a row, the last two times in a row, the last two times in a row, the last two times in a row, the last two times in a row, the last two times in a row, the last two times in a row, the last two times in a row, the last two times in a row, the last two times in a row, the last two times in a row, the last two times in a row, the last two times in a row, the last two times in a row, the last two times in a row, the last two times in a row, the last two times in a row, the last two times in a row, the last two times in a row, the last two times in a row, the last
But then the SGE turned things around, shooting the frustration of a mediocre start to the season out of their system within a good hour and winning 5:2. "It's crazy what the guys did today," jubilated coach Oliver Glasner on DAZN and spoke a "general praise, to each and every one of them who was there".
Initially, it looked like another setback for the now ninth-placed Frankfurt, which is still behind its expectations.
Patrik Schick had put the Leverkuseners in the lead with 2:0.
What then happened also impressed the SGE coach.
"How the players then came back and showed a fantastic performance," continued Glasner.
I am insanely happy with the performance we showed and of course with the result.
Even defender Christopher Lenz, who was able to stand on the field for the first time since the fourth game and his recovered muscle injury, emphasized the morale of his teammates.
"I believe that our attitude is incredible," said the 27-year-old and was particularly pleased for the spectators with a look at the result.
That was the party we wanted to throw today.
Glasner wants to keep the focus on himself for the upcoming tasks, but is also well-positioned in terms of the personnel situation.
It's unusual that we have all the players fit in December, that all the players are physically in top shape.
It's top-class work in our medical department, but the players also live a highly professional life.
Now they want to "move forward step by step and stay modest" and carry out the tasks until the end of the year "at this level".
Next up is an away game at Borussia Mönchengladbach on Wednesday as part of the English week (6.30 p.m., Sky).
Just now I received an email that my package is coming back to you due to an error on my part.
I've tried to call #PRS_ORG# and have it redirected, no chance.
Can it be sent directly to me again or do I have to wait until the money is refunded and place the order again?
That would mean for me that I will not order again, because it has already taken a very long time.
Have you ever sat in a #PRS_ORG# chair?
A damper for the handball women before the quarter-final against Spain
Germany's handball women slinked off the court after the humiliation against Denmark with their heads hung low and blank looks on their faces.
To conclude the main round of the World Championships, the DHB team suffered a heavy defeat with a score of 16:32 (8:13) in front of 800 spectators in Granollers, and must now take on host Spain in the quarter finals.
"We were too scared and we had too much respect for the opponent," said national coach Henk Groener.
Against Spain, we have to play differently.
After their first defeat in the tournament, Germany finished the main round group III with 8:2 points in second place behind the Danish team (10:0).
It's a shame that we couldn't take the flow with us.
It was a bad game from all of us that we have to erase," said captain Emily Bölk.
In the fight to make it into the semi-finals, a significant increase is needed against the 2019 World Cup runner-up on Tuesday to keep the delicate dream of the first medal since 2007 alive.
The best German thrower in the duel with the three-time Olympic champion Denmark was backcourt player Alina Grijseels with six goals.
"We just weren't there - neither in the attack, nor in defense," admitted backcourt player Xenia Smits and called for: "Now we have to look ahead quickly."
Not up to it from start to finish
Unlike in the previous five tournament games, the German team was not up to par at the start.
Missed shots and technical errors in the attack and gaps in the defence were responsible for a quick 0:4 deficit after seven minutes.
Only goalkeeper Dinah Eckerle was immediately up to speed and prevented worse with some saves.
The first goal was scored by the DHB team after 9:30 minutes, when Grijseels successfully completed a quick counterattack.
The hoped-for spark was not this, however.
Against the aggressive defence of the Danes, the German women could hardly make an impression - and when they did, they mostly failed against the strong Althea Reinhardt in the goal of the Scandinavians.
So the match was over early at 3:10 after 20 minutes, especially since backcourt player Mia Zschocke was soon shown red for a hard foul on her opponent.
In the quarter-finals, however, she is allowed to take part again.
It was only in the final phase of the first half that the DHB selection played a little better and at least came within five goals of the break.
The already faint hope of a comeback after the change was gone after seven minutes at 9:19.
Again, the Groener-Schützlinge sinned in all areas and made it easy for the well-prepared opponent, who is among the medal candidates in the final round.
As a result, the German team was unable to muster a performance boost and left the court as a clear loser.
DACH Advent Calendar Day 6: Family Christmas traditions
As part of the Reddit advent calendar, we've nabbed St. Nicholas' Day, and are using it as an opportunity to talk about family traditions during the pre-Christmas season, Advent, St. Nicholas' Day, Christmas Eve, and the Christmas holidays.
What was it like at your house back then?
How about with your partner\*?
Do you want to pass on your traditions to your children?
What do the children like best?
What about the boot shining?
Baking Christmas cookies?
Decorating trees?
Is music played?
Is it Santa Claus, the Christ Child, or is the gift from Grandma and Grandpa?
Regardless of how they do it, everyone makes an effort to make it as nice as possible as a family around Christmas.
Whether it's long-standing traditions, or even something different every year, tell us how it went or is going in your family!
Please send me any transaction number... or anything else that could help
Transfer confirmation... etc
I would like to gift a voucher code
just like #PRS_ORG# gift vouchers
How does it work for them?
The title exists, I work as a vaccination doctor in mobile vaccination teams, in which (so far only) the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine is mainly administered in nursing homes.
Since these are soon to be completed for the most part, I will go to a vaccination centre after that.
I am happy to answer questions without time limit on organisational and human aspects and also medical questions as long as they are not personal (e.g. "I am taking medication X, is it compatible with the vaccine...").
In my area of responsibility falls the information about the vaccination, the indication (the person has the right to a vaccination according to the Corona vaccination regulation and has no reasons that speak against it), the medical documentation and, if necessary, the emergency care for allergic reactions (which has never happened to me yet).
The vaccination itself can be delegated to qualified personnel, such as medical assistants.
In vaccination teams, however, we often don't have them, but "only" (in God's name, no lack of appreciation!) pharmaceutical-technical assistants for vaccine preparation, who, however, cannot carry out vaccinations (are allowed to?) so that I also do most of the vaccinations myself there.
Serious "Huidlerer"-question: Amberger knows the solution
What the hell is a "Huidlerer"?
With this dialect word, sent in by an Amberger, the BR television program "Wir in Bayern" has caused intense thought.
But unlike on many of the preceding days, the term in the series "Host mi?" this time remained unknown to the callers.
No, it was not a "man who is nervous."
And no one who "has to have everything done quickly".
This, the people heard from the TV presenter, was completely wrong.
To which the man from Amberg communicated the solution, and thus probably also caused surprise among many Upper Palatinates.
"Der Huidlerer", the viewers learned, "is a rag, with which someone wipes the oven".
Dialect researcher Antony Rowley, who has been questioned as an expert by Bavarian television for years, confirmed this.
With the remark that this is a typical Upper Palatinate term, somehow derived from the more well-known dialect word "Houdern".
Closing a gap in education - probably also for many people who have lived in the Amberg area for a long time.
I haven't been able to buy books for 2 weeks.
After confirmation, the following error message always appears: oops - something went wrong - try again later.
I have rebooted the #PRS_ORG#, connected to the PC, synced and repaired.
Nothing helped.
Tire choice for racing bikes - really so puncture-proof?
This morning, I woke up full of energy because I wanted to do at least a little bit of training in preparation for my cycling tour next week.
Said, done, and I set off on my racing bike, which I bought yesterday on eBay.
The first 40km were also really nice - but then something happened, which lurks in every city center (this time: thanks Krefeld!).
Glass splinters on the track.
Zack, loud hissing and my back wheel didn't want to do the rest of the track at all.
Since I had no real possibility to get a replacement jacket and a replacement tube due to the day of the week, I had to turn around with a semi-bad mood and take the first train home.
Then, in terms of mood, it wasn't so bad. Maybe it's even better if I practice changing the tyres again before the bike tour.
Now, however, I stand in front of a question and hope that you can help me.
Since I have a relatively long journey over several days ahead of me, I would not like to have this problem more than once.
Now it wasn't really bad, because the old tyres from the previous owner (a very nice old man, who had ridden 120km on the day I came to collect the bike until 2pm!) and who had also described them as sub-optimal, because he had been riding on rollers for several years with them.
But if I think about the fact that I have to change a tyre after 80-90km of driving, then I'm really in a bad mood, I think :D
Now, I got into a conversation with an older man at the platform who asked me in surprise why I didn't have Marathon Plus tires; they are supposed to be puncture-proof, after all.
Now, of course, it all sounds very enticing.
But are they really indestructible?
I'm not in the mood to spend 40€ per tyre now, only to be disappointed in the end.
I also wonder: I currently have 25x622 on my racing bike.
There are some (apparently?) with Marathon Plus tyres, but most of them are already wider.
Is this a problem?
Or would you advise me to get different tyres for a racing bike in general?
The Schwalbe page seems to recommend the Durano DD over my absolute layman's knowledge?
Thanks in advance for the help and kind regards!

Following the release of our new high-end wideband speaker B 100-6 OHM, it was only a matter of time before our SOLO series would get new offspring.
SOLO 15 is the new kid on the block and looks like the big role models with the B 200 - 6 OHM.
However, this construction proposal includes a suitable designed foot, to raise the speaker to the correct listening position.
This has no effect on the acoustics and can therefore be adjusted in length according to the circumstances at home.
The SOLO 15 is very well suited to people for whom the maximum volume plays a rather subordinate role, but who want to achieve an exceptionally high level of sound quality.
A 10 cm speaker is simply not capable of producing nearly unfiltered such high sound pressure levels.
However, this does not mean that the SOLO 15 sounds weak.
On the contrary, she comes across as impressively mature and for her size, extremely impressive and accurate.
The SOLO 15 was tuned tonally with a slight treble boost.
This is common for broadband to optimise the increasing bundling of high frequencies.
Perfectly oriented to the listening position, the SOLO 15 impresses with a very clear and fine sound.
Slightly turned outwards, the high-frequency range can be reduced and thus the sound image can be made warmer.
Thanks to the point sound source, the location of the individual components of a musical piece in the optimal stereo triangle is razor-sharp and surprisingly precise.
The reference-worthy extremely low mechanical losses of the B 100 - 6 OHM result in a sound dynamics that is second to none.
The SOLO 15 not only supplements our SOLO series, but also expands it in terms of resolution and accuracy.
As with all our kits, it's a good idea to think about the final look of the speaker before you start building, so you can make changes as you go.
If you want to veneer the case, for example, the lowering of the speaker needs to be adjusted accordingly, since the veneer adds material.
After all the plates have been cut (e.g. at the DIY store), one should first drill an 8 mm hole in the base plate at the corresponding location to be able to pass the cable through there later without any problems.
Now with the help of a router, the loudspeaker opening in the front is followed, so that the B 100 - 6 OHM can be installed flush later.
On the back, this opening should be provided with a 45° chamfer to make the opening area of the loudspeaker chassis inside as large as possible.
The four fastening points of the B 100 - 6 OHM get a phase break, as shown in the image "Detail Phase".
After that, you start building the actual box and place one of the two side walls on a flat surface in front of you.
The back, the lid, the front and the bottom will now be glued onto this.
The three stiffeners should also be used and glued.
The stiffeners themselves can be varied in material thickness as needed, for example if you want to use ready-made strips from the hardware store instead of making them yourself from 16 mm MDF.
In the next step, the second page is attached.
Afterwards, all the plates of the foot follow, i.e. the two sides as well as the front.
A suitable hole-saw or Forstner bit will make it easier to attach the openings of the bass reflex tube, as well as the connection terminal on the back wall.
Afterwards, one uses a round cutter to round off all the edges of the actual box.
The upper side of the foot plate can also be rounded off with it.
Afterwards, the footplate is firmly glued to the foot of the case and additionally screwed on with long wood screws.
The next step is to mark and pre-drill (2.5 mm drill bit) the mounting holes for the speaker chassis and the connection terminal.
After cleaning the case of wood dust (suck/blow out), one starts with laying the cables.
The easiest way to do this is through the 35 mm bass reflex opening in the back wall.
To do this, you push the entire, uncut cable piece by piece through the 8 mm hole in the foot until it reaches the terminal opening, leaving about 30 cm of it sticking out there.
In the upper part of the case, the cable is led to the speaker opening and left to hang loosely there as well.
Next, the crossover frequency is prepared and put into use.
The construction plan of the frequency switch and the corresponding connection plan can be taken from the following document: Assembly instructions switch Solo 15.
Once the frequency switch is installed and the connection terminal is screwed in, the sealing of the 8mm cable opening inside the box follows, which is not completely closed yet.
With the 35 mm bASSREFLEX opening and some skill, you can drop hot glue onto the opening and seal it.
By opening the B 100 - 6 OHM and using a small lamp, you can check the seal accordingly.
Now follows the eradication, according to the description.
Afterwards, the B 100 - 6 OHM is connected and screwed down with the corresponding screws.
The polarity plays an important role here, so that the plus cable (marked cable) must be soldered to the plus pole of the speaker (larger contact).
At the end, the bass reflex tube is cut to the specified length of 28 mm (total length of the tube) and inserted.
To combat it, a mat of the damping material is cut in half and loosely distributed in the case.
The opening around the bass reflex channel should be kept clear.
Can I place an order now and have it delivered in early June?
> Hello everyone,
> finally, we can announce that we'll also be hosting the OSCAST this year!
> We are unfortunately not able to get more than four people into the studio for known reasons, which means higher planning effort and explains the short notice of the announcement.
BUT: There will be at least three people on the call, so we'll be watching the 2021 Oscars with at least 7 beans in the stream, and hopefully thousands of you!
> We are doing our best to avoid delays or other problems.
But hey, it's still a pandemic, so we'll do our best to make the Oscars as entertaining as possible.
> It will start around 0:30.
Get cold drinks ready, plan some good food, and get ready for a long, but very interesting night.
