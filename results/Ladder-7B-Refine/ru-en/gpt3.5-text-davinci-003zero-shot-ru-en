From my point of view, the literature program was formed by middle-aged ladies based on their interests.
From 19th-century Russian literature, we preferred Danilevsky and Volkonsky.
They wrote fiction, of course, from the point of view of those very ladies of a certain age.
And the psychology and the suffering of Tolstoy's and Turgenev's heroines are not so interesting for teenagers.
Teenagers are rarely interested in the psychology of the heroes.
Thank you very much, it was very interesting.
Perhaps the roses were made of plush to represent a specific variety of them?
There are roses of this colour and with this petal structure, resembling velvet, usually deep red or burgundy tones.
And light-colored roses look different, with petals having a satin or silk-like shine.

The Promtex Micropacket Prestige 105x195 mattress.
The "Micropack Prestige" model: comfort and natural ingredients.
The mattress has different sides of varying firmness: the medium-firm surface is formed by latex-coated coconut fibre and natural latex, and the medium-soft side is formed by a natural latex slab.
The 1000-spring-per-square-metre spring unit quickly adapts to the sleeper's body, preventing the "wave" or "hammock" effect.
Among the advantages of the model, it is worth noting the breathable materials.
Latex, perforated for breathability, is naturally well-ventilated, as is coconut coir.
This maintains a healthy microclimate in the sleeping area.
In addition, the mattress is covered by an extended warranty.
The manufacturer's official guarantee period is 5 years, but in fact the life of the mattress is longer.
Protection from dust and dirt is provided by a removable jacquard cover provided with the set.
Pair your mattress with an orthopedic pillow - it is recommended to maintain the optimal position of the spine during sleep.
The filling determines the purpose of the sides - coconut serves as an anatomical support for the back, latex relaxes the muscles.
Use your brain and get rid of such relatives!
It's better not to have any at all than ones like these...
Either find an outside driver, or one who is willing to invest and work with you as a partner.
If it doesn't work out, sell the car, even at a loss, don't regret it.
Next time, think better...
Andrey, you have been clearly explained that pensioners work in schools, they will not work in the command line.
The IT teacher won't be able to help either, he wasn't taught this, the kids are playing games on Windows.
So there is no support.
I remember with horror those banquets and guests at my parents' house.
The guests are at the door, and the cutlets are still sizzling on the stove, and mom is frantically mopping the floor.
Lord, I was already too weak to sit at the table.
And then wash the dishes, clean the house.
For a week before the holiday you drag products, two days of cooking, and one day of cleaning afterwards.
What about the guests?
They are doing well, and they always bring a cake with them.
Ever since then, I don't like holidays and guests.
Even for my family, I set the table according to the minimum wage.
As for the treats, I make them for them, I bake a lot just for the fun of it.
Germany: A fourth COVID-19 vaccination is inevitable
A fourth vaccination will be required in the summer or fall of 2022.
According to the expert’s opinion, the current vaccination in Germany will not be final and will continue with renewed vigour.
Despite an intensive vaccination campaign in Germany, two or three doses of the corona vaccine will probably not be enough for full protection.
This is the belief of the head of the Association of General Practitioners, Ulrich Weigelt.
This was reported by Die Welt on Saturday, 11 December.
“We expect that a fourth vaccination will be required by summer, at the latest by autumn”, the expert believes.
In addition, Wiegeldt hopes that the fourth corona vaccination will be able to be carried out "in combination with the flu vaccination".
This will help to achieve the best results.
In addition, intensified vaccination can help in the fight against the spread of the new "Omicron" strain of the coronavirus.
Moreover, the new variant is especially dangerous.
Thus, the likelihood of reinfection with "Omicron" is three times higher than with the Delta or Beta strains.
This is evidenced by the results of a preliminary study conducted in South Africa.
Based on this, the BioNTech/Pfizer manufacturers plan to provide an Omicron-adapted vaccine by March 2022.
The companies stress that two doses of the vaccine do not provide sufficient protection against infection with the new Omicron variant of the coronavirus.
The study by BioNTech and Pfizer showed that with two doses of the vaccine, the effectiveness is significantly lower: "the neutralizing potential is reduced by more than 25 times".
"This indicates that two doses of BNT162b2 do not provide sufficient protection against infection with the Omicron strain," said BioNTech and Pfizer.
That's why a third dose is needed.
Experts insist on accelerating the pace of vaccination in the country.
For example, the chairman of the German Society for Infectious Diseases, Bernd Salzberger, advocates reducing the interval between the second and third vaccinations.
Moreover, according to Salzberger, accelerated vaccination will have an impact on the spread of both the delta virus and the omicron variant of the coronavirus.
"Israel's experience shows this very convincingly," the expert emphasized.
Pontoon21 wobbler, Bet-A Vib, 54 Silent, 54 mm, 8.5 g.
The Bet-A-Vib series is a special branch of the Bet-A family from Pontoon21®.
It (along with the Kalikana Vib series) differs from many other vibes in that it was originally designed to be used for ice fishing as well as trolling.
These vibrations have a greater specific weight than similar-sized analogues, which, without a doubt, has a positive effect on the nuances of using these interesting lures.
Another distinctive feature is the top fin, made of durable and elastic plastic, creating additional shades of vibration during both vertical and horizontal retrieves.
As a "winter bait," the Bet-A-Vib demonstrates a fairly aggressive game.
Often the most productive is simple monotonous animation, that is, the movement of the lure up and down almost without pauses.
When planning, the deviation from the vertical axis is not very large, which is convenient when fishing in a limited space that is cluttered with underwater plants, snags and other obstacles that can cause a snag.
In addition, a slight deviation is relevant when fishing for pike and large perch in winter, and especially in the middle of winter, when a pinpoint and aggressive presentation of the lure is required.
Reaching the end of its trajectory, Bet-A-Vib instantly reverses and returns to the original vertical.
Bet-A-Vib is no less successfully applied for winter fishing for pond trout.
To cater to her whims, you can choose from two modifications: with a sound capsule (NS – NanoSound) or without it (SL – Silent).
It is also noted that Bet-A-Vib can provoke a reaction from a passive pike that does not even react to a live bait.
When casting the Bet-A-Vib demonstrates distance and accuracy.
This lure is easy to understand and not finicky, works well with both monofilament and braided lines even of large diameters.
For catching pike, pikeperch, bream, or perch, in addition to the uniform, the "step" is also relevant, sometimes with "clicking" on the bottom.
If you are fishing in snaggy areas, you can change the front treble hook for a double hook, which reduces the chances of snagging.
Among lures in its class, the Bet-A-Vib is one of the most durable and, as a result, one of the most effective.
It can be used with equal success in both relatively shallow and quite deep areas.
All models are equipped with Owner ST-36 hooks.
How many young freeloaders sit on the necks of old parents.
"The Golden Youth" are clearly indolent layabouts, who know nothing and can do nothing.
A life of plenty leads to idleness.
Perhaps Mishustin was referring to this substantial part of the population.
You must be joking.
I have never seen any shoes in this store that I wanted to buy.
What kind of long-term wear are you writing about?
These shoes are made of artificial leather.
It will be good if it lasts for one season.
"Zenden" is on the same level as "Karri".
Go in a couple of times, take a look and understand that there's nothing to do there.
7,000 Russian mercenaries reported in Libya
More than 7,000 mercenaries from the private military company (PMC) Wagner are in Libya.
This was announced on Sunday, 12 December, by the Chairman of the Supreme State Council of the Republic, Khaled al-Mishri.
"Currently, there are more than 7,000 Wagner Group mercenaries in Libya.
They also have airplanes.
They are also digging trenches in Sirte and Kufra.
They have 30 fighter jets at the Garabuli air base (which is also used as a civilian airport in Sirte)," the Anadolu agency quotes him as saying.
Khaled al-Mishri also pointed out that Russian mercenaries are "trying to capture" the central part of Libya, stretching from Chad to the Mediterranean Sea, after "bringing their man to power" in the Central African Republic.
Keep a presence
According to the source, Moscow was looking for a country to maintain its presence in North Africa, and “settled on Libya”.
"Wagner" has been in Libya since 2019, using the airbase and port in Sirte, as well as the airbase in Jufra, the agency's publication notes.
Russian authorities officially deny that the Wagner PMC has the support of the Kremlin.
Where else could the mercenaries be?
According to the agency, “Wagner” is reportedly active in nine African countries: the Central African Republic, Libya, Sudan, Mozambique, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Madagascar, Zimbabwe, and Angola.
The company provides military training for local forces, personal security for leaders, and protection for energy facilities.
In return for these services, Wagner’s subsidiaries receive certain privileges and licenses to use mineral resources and natural resources, as well as for the supply of weapons, technologies and military services to these countries”, the article states.
According to the media, the “Wagnerites” allegedly fought in Donbass, Syria, Mozambique, Sudan, and the Central African Republic.
This group is not registered with any of the law enforcement agencies or in the registry of legal entities, and its fighters are absent from the official lists of personnel.
This company is under U.S. sanctions.
Recall that earlier the ambassadors of 27 EU countries approved restrictions against “Wagner”.
This decision is expected to be approved by the Council of the European Union on December 13.
The situation in Libya
The Supreme State Council of Libya is de facto the second chamber of parliament with consultative functions, dominated by Islamists, writes TASS.
This body has repeatedly called for the postponement of the single day of voting for the election of members of parliament and the head of state from 24 December at least until February 2022.
“Less than two weeks remain until the election, and the chances that it will take place on time are rapidly decreasing”, the material notes.
Against this backdrop, the Libyan High Electoral Commission has indefinitely postponed the announcement of the final list of candidates, Sky News Arabia reports.
Foreign policy as seen by Russians
38% of Russians see more successes than failures in the country’s foreign policy, while 29% think that there are more failures.
"Examples of success: "protected and restored peace in Syria", "decision on Nord Stream 2", "frightened the whole world with powerful weapons", "we took back Crimea".
The main failures are “conflict with Ukraine”, “confrontation with Western countries”, and “isolation from the world”, according to research by the Public Opinion Foundation.
The government of Dubai has completely abandoned paper-based record-keeping - all government services have also become digital-only
The Dubai government has announced a complete rejection of paper-based administration and a shift to digital technologies.
All public services for citizens will also be provided exclusively in electronic form.
This is reported by the Emirati news agency WAM.
"Today marks the beginning of a new phase of digitising all aspects of life in Dubai - we have completed the transition to a fully paperless government," the Crown Prince of the emirate, Chairman of the Executive Council of Dubai, Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, said on Saturday.
Now, the internal and external documentation in all Dubai government establishments will be carried out only in digital form through special information platforms.
The innovation has affected all sectors without exception: health care, utilities, the police, municipal authorities, courts, and so on. Many commercial structures have also joined the government’s initiative.
The transition to e-government and digitization of document management began in Dubai in 2018.
Over this time, the authorities have calculated that 336 million sheets of paper have been saved, which is equivalent to 14 million hours of human labour and $353.8 million in monetary terms.
Earlier, Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin stated that electronic services save citizens two days a year.
Dana, well, about dates of birth and how old the child is, that's already dementia, about the class and group in kindergarten, too.
I just don’t believe that people like this exist.
And if they do exist, they clearly don't care about anything, including family.
My mother, her two brothers and her grandfather and grandmother lived at 3 Vladimirskaya, there was the first floor without bars.
They first knocked on the door, then on the window, then they decided not to be polite, broke the window and came in, but the grandfather had a baseball bat, which they received.
These people knew for sure that there was someone in the house...
Turkey's car production, exports fall below 2020 level
Turkey's car production and exports fell sharply in November amid lira devaluation.
As a result, the industry's figures for the first 11 months were worse than last year's figures, Bloomberg reports, citing data from the Turkish Automotive Manufacturers' Association.
According to the association, 115,000 cars were released from factories in Turkey in November, which is 20% less than a year earlier.
Around 75,900 cars were exported, which is more than 25% lower than last year’s figure.
And if, according to the results of the first 10 months of this year, the Turkish automotive sector demonstrated positive dynamics compared to the previous year, then, according to the results of 11 months of 2021, car production turned out to be already 0.3% worse than last year's figure.
The cause of this fall was a sharp depreciation of the Turkish lira, which in November fell by 29% against the dollar.
This led to a fall in economic activity across all sectors.
More than 500 MSMEs received credit payment relief in 2021
The First Deputy Prime Minister Alikhan Smailov spoke about the situation with the provision of benefits for small and medium-sized businesses, a Kazinform correspondent reports.
“According to information from the Republic of Kazakhstan Agency for Regulation and Development of the Financial Market, in the current year, the order of the Chairman of the Agency dated 9 April 2021 No. 127 “On approval of the procedure for granting a payment deferral on loans to small and medium-sized businesses” has been adopted in implementation of the instruction of the Head of State dated 1 April 2021”, wrote Alikhan Smailov in his response to the deputy’s request.
He reminded that the procedure for the deferral of loan payments provided for banks and organizations engaged in microfinance to provide a deferral of payments on loans issued before April 1, 2021, to SMEs, including individual entrepreneurs, during the period from April 1 to June 30, 2021.
The deferral period was from 30 to 90 days at the discretion of the SME.
The borrower's statement may have indicated a different payment deferral period.
During the deferment period for the borrower, claim and legal proceedings were suspended, notification of the need to pay off the overdue debt, as well as the collection of commissions and other payments by the creditor, were suspended," the deputy prime minister noted.
In 2021, second-level banks received applications for loan payment deferrals from 603 SME borrowers, of which 553 SME subjects received deferrals in the amount of 9.7 billion tenge.
131 SME subjects applied to the MFIs for a deferment, of which 95 subjects were granted a deferment in the amount of 105.8 million tenge," A. Smailov concluded.
The pulmonologist Puryasev suggested that people with a weak immune system are able to easily tolerate the “omicron” strain.
A doctor suggested that people with a weakened immune system may be able to handle it better than those with a strong immune response
The pulmonologist Sergey Puryasev explained why the omicron variant of the coronavirus could be dangerous.
The reason can be found in the conditions in which the virus originated.
Scientists believe that the “okmiron” was born in the body of an HIV-infected or immunodeficient person.
That is, in the event of a mutation, it did not meet any resistance from the immune system.
This makes him more aggressive.
Because there was no immune response, it became very fast.
Apparently, there are more of these spike proteins, which are like thorns, than there should be, and their antibodies have not been reduced during mutations, says pulmonologist Sergey Puryasev.
The doctor suggested that people with a weakened immune system may be able to tolerate "ocmiron" better than those with a strong immune response.
It turns out that a strong response by the body to anything, any infection, is not always a good thing.
In such cases, the body can kill itself.
This is what happens with pneumococcal infections, when young people in their 30s die, but old people in their 60s survive it like a sneeze.
The immune response is out of control in young people, it’s completely inappropriate: where you could only wave your finger, it’s like firing a cannon at a sparrow, Sergey Puryasev concluded.
The doctor also reminded that the coronavirus has dangerous side effects, and the most unpleasant of them is pneumonia.
Pneumonia can be bacterial or viral.
If the first one is treated very successfully and quickly, in the second case it is often only possible to treat the symptoms – all hope lies with the body.
The first sign of developing pneumonia will be the beginning of intoxication of the body - this is a fever, weakness, malaise.
Then come the respiratory symptoms: shortness of breath, a sore throat, a cough.
Pain on the right or left, as well as abdominal pain, can also indicate a developing problem.
In the meantime, in Russia, they may start vaccinating the younger generation, aged 12 to 18, by the end of the year.
Virologist, head of the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology genome engineering laboratory Pavel Volchkov noted that this category is very actively suffering from COVID-19.
For teenagers who go to school, the number of contacts is at its maximum.
This is the most socially active group, just like children in kindergartens, said Pavel Volchkov, a virologist and the head of the Laboratory of Genomic Engineering at the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology, to Moscow 24.
A huge thank you to the author of this article.
It was a pleasure to refresh my memories...
Teath-In.
In those distant 1970s and 1980s, no dance floor could do without the music of this group.
And at home, when they gathered with friends, they would dance to their music.
Immunologists have put forward a hypothesis as to why people with obesity become victims of Covid-19
The authors of the study examined the fatty tissue left over from bariatric surgery and found that fat cells known as adipocytes can be infected by the coronavirus.
The immune cells located in the fatty tissue, the macrophages, were also infected, and showed a strong inflammatory reaction.
Scientists also examined the fatty tissue of patients who died from COVID-19 and found particles of the coronavirus in the fat surrounding various organs.
It is known that HIV and influenza viruses can hide in fat tissue, using it as a reservoir, in attempts to evade the immune system's response.
It is likely that SARS-CoV-2 is also capable of this.
The biologist spoke about the causes of dementia
The candidate of biological sciences, Semen Golosheikin, named the causes of dementia and spoke about ways to prevent it in an interview with the Sputnik radio station.
According to WHO, more than 55 million people are affected by this disease.
The syndrome manifests itself in a gradual loss of cognitive functions - over time, a person with the syndrome finds it difficult to orient themselves even in familiar surroundings.
Golosheykin noted that the most common causes of dementia are neurodegenerative disorders, head injuries, certain infections, metabolic disorders, and a lack of certain vitamins.
Some factors increase the risk of developing the condition.
This includes hypertension, diabetes, high cholesterol, obesity, depression, and alcoholism.
At the behavioural level, factors such as social isolation and lack of active cognitive engagement may play a role," he said.
Dementia can also be affected by harmful habits - smoking, alcohol abuse, sleep disorders and a sedentary lifestyle.
Among the first signs the expert noted forgetfulness, inability to concentrate, and a decrease in the level of abstract thinking.
"There is a debate whether hearing loss can be an early sign of Alzheimer's or a risk factor for it," the biologist added.
To prevent the onset of the disease, WHO recommends maintaining a sufficient level of physical activity, training cognitive skills and abilities that require the involvement of memory and logic.
Previously, the professor of the Department of Neurology, Neurosurgery and Medical Genetics of the Federal State Budgetary Educational Institution of Higher Education Russian National Research Medical University named after N.I. Pirogov.
N.I. Pirogova, head of the Department of Cognitive Disorders at the Federal Center for Brain and Neurotechnologies, Anna Bogolepova, spoke about the causes of memory problems.
Egypt has returned around 30,000 artifacts illegally taken out of the country
In the last 10 years, the government of Cairo has managed to repatriate about 30,000 artifacts that were illegally smuggled out of the country.
This was reported on Saturday, December 11, on the Al-Hayat TV channel by the chief inspector of the returned antiquities department of the Egyptian ministry of tourism and antiquities, Shaaban Abdel Gawad.
Since 2011, the Egyptian state has managed to return 29,300 artifacts.
Just this year, 5,300 artifacts of ancient Egyptian civilization were discovered at the Bible Museum in Washington," he said.
Abdel Gawad clarified that all the smuggled artifacts are registered in the archives.
The department's staff are currently working on their return to Egypt.
In particular, experts “track auctions all over the world and online sales” through foreign and Egyptian websites, as well as social networks.
The chief inspector said that upon their return, the cultural treasures are restored and then put on display in museums.
According to him, one of the returned artifacts was an ancient human skeleton discovered in Belgium, which is now part of the collection of the National Museum of Egyptian Civilization in Cairo.
In 2020, the Egyptian authorities appealed to Interpol to help find a bust of the Pharaoh Tutankhamun sold at an auction in London.
The auction house Christie's held an auction on 4 July, at which the 3,000-year-old bust was sold for $5.97 million (about 680 million roubles).
This has led to discontent from Egypt.
The Egyptian side also claims that the artwork was illegally taken out of the Karnak temple in Luxor in the 1970s.
The head of Tutankhamun, depicted as the sun god Amun, had been in a private collection and had not been on the market since 1985.
It is unknown how the relic came to Europe.
In recent years, Egypt has actively sought the repatriation of antiquities that were illegally taken out of the country at different times.
According to the authorities, 95% of smuggled antiquities is the result of archaeological excavations by "black diggers".
"The Crimean Tatars are not taken into account" - and this is correct, because the Crimean Tatars (232,000) are a separate people (close to the Turks).
If you want to add something, then only 42 thousand people - that's how many Kazan Tatars live in Crimea (see the census).
The Crimean Tatars are a separate people, and the name of this people consists of two words!
The only thing that unites them is the Turkic language group.
FT: Credit Suisse wants access to employees' personal mobile devices
Credit Suisse is requiring its employees to give the bank access to their personal mobile phones, the Financial Times reports.
The fact is that in Europe and the United States, the Swiss bank does not issue its employees with corporate communications devices, instead offering a discount on the purchase of a mobile phone or smartphone from a partner - a telecommunications operator.
Under current rules, the bank can view information on corporate devices issued to its employees as they are used to conduct business with colleagues or clients.
The bank has the right to inspect mobile devices in extreme cases - for example, if an employee used it to conduct a meeting with a client that was not approved by Credit Suisse.
Now, with many employees working from home, the bank wants to extend this rule to all devices used for work.
According to the newspaper, the bank's management has set a deadline by which employees must familiarize themselves with the new rule.
Credit Suisse has not officially commented on the new requirement.

Part 4
The last year of Sergei Yesenin's life - 1925 - was fruitful in terms of creativity, but the most difficult for the poet's earthly existence and his "ego".
He is already beyond any literary associations, he has broken away from imagism, he is on his own, but he is well known, in demand, sometimes harshly criticized by critics, even spitefully, but the reading public is ready to carry him on their hands.
More than 60 poems were written in a year, many of them are real masterpieces, the "Persian Motifs" cycle was completed, the poem "Anna Snegina" was written, 8 books were published, and the collection "Soviet Russia".
And the main success was at the end of June 1925, when the State Publishing House signed a contract with Esenin for the publication of his works in three volumes.
None of the modern-day poets honored Sergei Alexandrovich, he was the first!
Moreover, it promised very good money – according to the contract, the salary was 1000 roubles per month for 20 months (the factory director, for example, received 300 roubles per month, an engineer – 200).
Money was needed that year more than ever.
Yesenin married the granddaughter of Leo Tolstoy, Sofya Tolstaya, and he had to arrange family life, support his sisters Katya and Sasha, as well as his mother.
It seemed that life was settling down, there was something to be happy about, but for him everything was mainly in dark tones, as if the nightmare from the poem "Black Man" (written in November 1925 and published after Esenin's death) materialized:
My friend, my friend,
I'm very, very ill.
I don't know where this pain came from.
Either the wind is whistling
Over an empty and deserted field,
Is it like a wood in September,
Alcohol clouds the brain.
Many acquaintances noted that Yessenin had become very weak, looked bad, and was clearly ill.
More and more people are experiencing meltdowns and nervous breakdowns.
And the reason is probably not just alcoholism...
However, if such a diagnosis of alcoholism was made to Sergei Alexandrovich by someone, there are no reliable documents left.
For example, related to the month of May 1923, when, at the insistence of his fourth wife, the American Isadora Duncan, Esenin was recovering his health in a clinic near Paris under the guidance of Professor Pyotr Gannushkin (Esenin will return to him two years later, already in Moscow).
However, there is no shortage of evidence of the poet's drinking bouts, scandals on this subject, and arrests - they are scattered across dozens of memoirs.
Since the early 1920s, the terrible romance between the poet and the green snake has been developing rapidly.
At the end of the summer of 1923, Yesenin lived for a short time with his friend, the imagist Ivan Starcev.
Amazingly, despite having a pretty good income, Esenin never had his own home in either Moscow or Petersburg; he lived in rented apartments, hotels, or with acquaintances.
Starcev remembers:
"He would only come to sleep, and most of the time in an incoherent, drunken state.
Once, returning at four in the morning, Yessenin fell on the landing...
Falling, I scratched my face and wheezed.
After coming to, he began to cough continuously, spraying the entire sheet with blood..."
Even Esenin himself, after a tour of Europe and the USA (there was a dry law in the States at that time, but Duncan took a decent supply of alcohol with her) admitted:
"I didn't see anything there, except for pigs and streets...
By the end, I stopped remembering people...
Well, and he drank, of course...
But I drank because I was overcome with longing."

Promtex-Orient Duet Latex Econom 100x195 mattress
Promtex-Orient Duet Latex Econom is a modern version of the budget model in the premium class line.
The mattress is based on a block of independent double Duet springs.
Inside the large spring is a smaller, softer spring.
This allows for an even distribution of weight on the mattress.
Both sides of the mattress are filled with a filler - artificial latex.
It is an alternative to natural latex, but it is denser and less expensive.
The flexibility and elasticity of this material increases the comfort effect of the mattress.
Artificial latex is hypoallergenic, it doesn't absorb moisture or dust.
The mattress is perfect for a couple with a large difference in weight (up to 30 kilograms).
Thanks to the "smart" springs, there is no wave effect here, when the light partner slides to the side of the heavy one.
The pleasant, soft-to-the-touch Sense jacquard cover is lined with a layer of synthetic wadding.
Natural fabrics do not retain static electricity.
It is possible to manufacture this mattress model in a rolled-up version (vacuum roll-packing).
Now his son is almost 16, and he has long been no longer tormented by the desire to mess around.
All the energy is focused on choosing what he will make a living doing.
He's much more responsible than I was at his age or my husband, who had periodic run-ins with the law up until his wedding.
A father cares for his young daughter.
And it loves, as Lermontov wrote, "in a strange way".
Why did the girl cry during the exam when she hadn't failed it yet?
Why didn't he tell his daughter that it wasn't school.
Well, it will have a tail.
So what?
They will retake it.
This is known to millions of students.
What is it even about?
Poland's foreign ministry believes Belarus is using migrants as 'weapon' against EU
Poland’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs considers that Belarus is using migrants as “weapons”
The Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of Poland, Pawel Jablonsky, expressed the opinion that the President of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko, used refugees as a "weapon" against the European Union and intends to resume such an "operation" next year.
The deputy head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs made the corresponding statement in an interview with the Australian Financial Review newspaper.
According to Yablonsky, the sanctions against Belarus temporarily "stopped Lukashenko", but he is "actively looking for new ways".
Also, the Polish official is sure that now illegal migrants will be used as a weapon "in many parts of the world."
As the kp.ru website wrote, earlier, the European Union implemented the fifth package of sanctions against Belarus.
It touched 17 individuals and 11 organizations.
Europe has announced its readiness to continue to expand restrictive measures against the republic “if the situation in the country does not improve”.
In response, Minsk imposed a food embargo on a wide range of goods from countries that had previously decided to impose sanctions against Belarus.

"Not for Senya's cap": when a velvet jacket makes a man a laughing stock
Velvet jackets dominated the social scene in 2021.
Perhaps the first to declare his new fashion choice was Daniel Craig.
Back in September, at the premiere of the film “No Time to Die”, he appeared in a velvet raspberry jacket and a traditional “Bond” bow tie.
Following his example, Prince William has twice broken the royal dress code, first by wearing a green velvet jacket to the Earthshot Prize awards ceremony, and then choosing a more classic option for an event in support of the Royal Variety charity.
A couple of weeks ago, Lionel Messi also joined the trend.
The football player came to pick up his seventh “Golden Ball” in a velvet Dolce & Gabbana jacket.
By the way, his sons were dressed the same.
AliExpress is already noting a growing demand for velvet men's jackets in Russia.
According to data from the service’s analysts, received by Gazeta.Ru, they are being purchased 1.4 times more often.
The most popular are warm velvet blazers with a lining and a fitted silhouette, the main colours are dark beige, burgundy, dark blue and, of course, black.
The average price of such models is from 3,000 to 6,000 roubles. At the same time, men prefer to buy only jackets; they choose sets of velvet suits less often.
You can buy them not only from online retailers.
Budget options are available at H&M, Mango, Next and Zara.
In the luxury segment, velvet blazers are present in almost all brands this season - Brioni, Paul Smith, Etro and Saint Laurent.
The most sought-after model is said to be the one worn by brand ambassador Jared Leto at one of the premieres of the film "House of Gucci".
When choosing jackets from expensive brands, you can be sure that the velvet is made from silk.
Thanks to a special weaving technology, a dense fabric is obtained with a furry outer texture and a smooth inner side.
More budget-friendly options are made from cotton or polyamide, but they don't last as long as a result.
The Lamoda fashion expert Ilya Vakhoshkin warns that when it comes to velvet jackets, the most important thing is not its model or style, but its appropriateness.
"Velvet requires an evening light, so such a jacket is ideal if you're going to a party or a formal event," explains Vakhoshkin. "It will also be suitable for those occasions when the invitation specifies a "Black Tie" or "Creative Black Tie" dress code.
Another important criterion that makes it possible to choose a velvet blazer is the status of its buyer.
“A man in a velvet jacket, first of all, should get hold of the right up-to-date set of people with enough money,” the authors of the Telegram channel about men’s fashion “Handsome Brammell” believe. “The owners of velvet jackets, as a rule, belong to the caste of those people who rarely buy tickets.
They are simply invited to the social events that are always associated with a dress code.
Ilya Vakhoshkin suggests combining the velvet jacket with similar dressy items: classic trousers with creases, plain shirts, silk ties, tasselled loafers, and cufflinks.
Too simple and everyday things will look out of place.
The fashion experts from "Beau Brummell" are sure that it would be inappropriate for an ordinary employee to appear in a velvet jacket at a corporate event, but if we are talking about "a leader among those who are in charge of this event, then - yes, such a thing would be suitable for him".
If the lower-ranked employee's goal is to move up in the company's complex hierarchy or earn financial bonuses, it's better not to wear a velvet jacket.
The management will definitely appreciate the phrase "not a hat for Senya", say the editors of the Telegram channel about men's fashion.
I have very mixed feelings about the voice.
It's an unnatural timbre, so strained.
And it has absolutely nothing to do with the sweet face of a young girl.
To be honest, I don't understand the admiration of those around me.
But from the bottom of my heart, I wish you good luck in life!
It all comes down to money - alternative energy is well-lobbied, i.e. bribed.
Billions of dollars of investment.
Are they sad?
No, the price of electricity has gone up.
Traditional energy is also not a problem - both gas, oil, and coal were bought cheaper than they are being sold now.
There's wild demand for fuel.
A penny is dripping.
And who is in the gap, then?
As usual, he was just a regular customer.
Do the sheriff care about the problems of the Indians?
Therefore, one should not consider western politicians idiots for “sleeping through” the energy crisis.
They did their job.
For a reasonable fee.
I didn't see any beautiful people in the photos in the article.
It's just mediocrity among average passengers.
Perhaps, if such characters are so confident in their beauty that they decide to show it to the entire train, then they probably won't be approached.
But only because of the mental disorder and ignorance of such "beauts", but not because of their appearance.

The slave who does not realize his slavery and wallows in a silent, unconscious, and wordless slave life is simply a slave.
The slave who drools when he smugly describes the benefits of being a slave and praises his kind and good master is a lackey, a sycophant."
An immunologist stated that revaccination in 4-5 months will help protect against the "omicron" strain of the coronavirus
Revaccination after four to five months can protect against the new omicron strain of the coronavirus infection.
This statement was made by immunologist Nikolai Kryuchkov, who called the vaccination six months later, taking into account the emergence of a new strain, "a very long period"
“With the previous strains, such a time frame was normal, but now it’s best to conduct the procedure after five months, and for people with chronic diseases, after four”, the expert stated, calling for revaccination in parallel with the vaccination campaign.
Kruglov also noted that early revaccination provides a good titer of neutralizing antibodies.
"If a person has had two vaccinations and a booster, or has recovered and has been vaccinated, or has been vaccinated and has recovered, then they have "hybrid immunity", that is, there are a lot of antibodies and enough neutralising ones," the expert clarified.
G7 warns Russia of 'severe consequences' in event of Ukraine invasion
The G7 countries (the United Kingdom, Germany, Italy, Canada, the United States, France, and Japan) published a statement following the meeting of foreign ministers in Liverpool.
It emphasises that "military aggression" by Russia against Ukraine "will have huge consequences and will be very expensive" for Moscow, but no specific measures are described in the document.
"We, the foreign ministers of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States of America, and the High Representative of the European Union, are united in our condemnation of Russia's military build-up and aggressive rhetoric towards Ukraine," the statement said.
Next, the ministers called on Russia to "de-escalate, use diplomatic channels and respect its international commitments on military transparency," as U.S. President Biden said during a video call with Russian President Putin on December 7.
"We reaffirm our support for the efforts of France and Germany in the Normandy format to achieve full implementation of the Minsk agreements in order to resolve the conflict in eastern Ukraine," the G7 foreign ministers also stated.
The use of force to change borders is strictly prohibited under international law.
Russia should have no doubt that further military aggression against Ukraine will have massive consequences and severe costs," they warned.
We reaffirm our unwavering commitment to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine and the right of any sovereign state to determine its own future.
We welcome the restrained position of Ukraine.
We will intensify our cooperation on our common and comprehensive response," the statement also said.
Earlier in the day, British Foreign Secretary Elizabeth Truss said Russia would face "serious consequences" in the event of an invasion of Ukraine.
According to her, this meeting showed the "united voice of the G7 countries, which account for 50% of the world's GDP, and which have made it very clear that the invasion of Ukraine will have enormous consequences for Russia".
Pfizer vaccine found to be 32 times less effective against Omicron strain
The effectiveness of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine against the omicron strain of the coronavirus is 32 times lower than against other types of the disease.
Scientists from the University of Hong Kong and the Chinese University of Hong Kong came to this conclusion, according to the South China Morning Post (SCMP).
The vaccine was found to be less effective on the basis of research into the antiviral activity of people who had received two doses of the COVID-19 drug.
"We see that most people had high levels of antiviral activity against the original variant of Sars-CoV-2, however, this ability was greatly reduced against the omicron variant," said Professor Malik Peiris.
At the same time, scientists emphasized that vaccination remains the most reliable way to protect against a severe course of the disease when infected with the coronavirus.
Earlier, researchers from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine predicted the development of the coronavirus pandemic, taking into account the impact of the omicron strain on it.
The authors of the study concluded that the omicron strain could cause a new wave of virus circulation and an increase in mortality if additional measures are not taken.
Ukraine’s defense minister has accused Germany of blocking NATO weapons deliveries to Kiev
The head of the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense, Aleksey Reznikov, accused the government of former German Chancellor Angela Merkel of blocking Kiev’s acquisition of lethal weapons within the framework of NATO.
In an interview with the Financial Times on December 12, Reznikov recalled that last month Germany vetoed the purchase of anti-sniper systems and rifles to defeat drones by Ukraine.
At the same time, it is noted that later Berlin softened its position on rifles, recognizing them as non-lethal weapons.
According to the defense minister, Kiev intends to acquire the aforementioned weapons as part of bilateral agreements with allies.
In particular, this includes the United States, the United Kingdom, Lithuania, and France.
Meanwhile, the FT notes that the position of the new German government led by Chancellor Olaf Scholz on the issue of supplying weapons to Ukraine remains unclear.
Earlier on Sunday, Ukraine’s ambassador to Germany, Andrey Melnik, expressed the opinion that Kiev should not expect arms deliveries from Berlin under Chancellor Scholz.
According to him, the previous German leadership explained its refusal to provide weapons as a risk of a military escalation of the conflict in Donbas, despite the "Russian occupation" of part of Ukrainian territory.
The diplomat is sure that Germany will maintain the same “illogical” position with the new chancellor.
In August, the Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky said that Kiev was waiting for assistance from Berlin in equipping the naval fleet.
In Ukraine, they hope that Germany “will be a partner of Ukraine in a technical sense”, added the president.
It was also noted that in the spring of this year, co-chairman of the German Green Party Robert Habeck visited the republic, where he spoke out in favor of selling Kiev defensive weapons.

Mercedes lodged a protest against the result of the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix
The German team Mercedes, whose driver Lewis Hamilton finished second at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix behind Red Bull driver Max Verstappen, has filed a protest against the final result of the race, according to the Formula 1 press service.

According to the second, Verstappen overtook Hamilton before the allowed "restart" zone.
We will add that now the results of the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, according to which Verstappen was ahead of Hamilton by 2.256 seconds and won the Formula 1 world championship, are preliminary, as it is not known when the Mercedes protests will be considered.
G7 warns Russia of accountability for Ukraine invasion
G7 foreign ministers warned of "serious consequences" for Russia if it continues military aggression against Ukraine, according to the final statement of the parties.
The participants of the meeting also noted that they condemn the reinforcement of Russian armed forces near the country's borders.
"There should be no doubt in Russia's mind that further military aggression against Ukraine will have massive consequences and severe costs," said a statement published on the UK government website.
The G7 ministers and EU High Representative said they were "united in their condemnation of Russia's military build-up and aggressive rhetoric towards Ukraine."
British Foreign Secretary, Elizabeth Truss, at a press conference in Liverpool, warned of "serious consequences" for Russia in the event of an invasion of Ukraine.
We have made it clear that any invasion will have massive consequences...
The G7 wants Russia to stop its aggression against Ukraine," she said (quoted by TASS).
Earlier, at the summit in Liverpool, G7 foreign ministers agreed that in order to resolve the crisis due to the build-up of Russian forces on the border with Ukraine, the parties need to return to the negotiating table.
This was about negotiations in the “Normandy format”.
The North Atlantic Alliance also spoke out in favor of a dialogue on Ukraine in the “Normandy format”.
Russian Foreign Ministry representative Maria Zakharova stated that, by calling on Russia and Ukraine to return to the negotiating table, the G7 countries "have signed off on their inability to take responsibility for their own mistakes".

Ways to return money stolen through online stores have been revealed
There are several ways to get your money back when it's stolen through an online store and not become a victim of fraud in the future.
Experts in information security revealed them in a conversation with RBC.
For example, to reduce the risk of major losses in the event of a bank card falling into the hands of a criminal, it is recommended to keep the main funds on a card or bank account that is not used for online shopping.
Part of the savings can be put into a savings account and withdrawn as needed.
Experts also recommend getting a separate card for online purchases.
If the money was stolen during shopping in stores that do not use the 3D Secure protection technology, a refund procedure can be initiated.
“In accordance with the rules established by the payment systems for unauthorized transactions conducted without the use of 3D Secure, responsibility lies with the participant in the payment chain who does not use this service”, clarified a representative of Promsvyazbank.
Expert from international payment provider Ecommpay Arthur Zaremba emphasized that the buyer has the right to submit an application to the bank to challenge the fraudulent operation no later than 120 days after the purchase.
In addition, if the criminal used the card on online resources that do not require two-factor authentication, the transaction can be disputed and the money can be returned.
It is noted that in some cases, online stores will themselves return the money to the customer if the order has not yet been shipped.
On November 19, a member of the Public Chamber, Director of the Safe Internet League, Ekaterina Mizulina, reported that, in 2021 alone, 11,000 complaints were received on various cases of fraud: from the sale of counterfeit documents to the theft of personal data.
According to her, a single window for complaints about online fraudsters may be an effective solution in the current circumstances.
Scholz arrived in Poland to discuss "Nord Stream 2" and EU legislation
The newly elected German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has arrived in Warsaw for talks on the migrant crisis on the border with Belarus, judicial independence in Poland, the build-up of Russian troops on the borders of Ukraine, and the situation with the Russian Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline.
While Scholz stated his desire to maintain good relations between Germany and Poland for years to come, the two leaders expressed unambiguous expectations of each other.
Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said he would call on Scholz to speak out against "Nord Stream 2," which is expected to deliver Russian gas to Germany bypassing Ukraine.
According to Moravec, Russia can use the gas pipeline against Europe as a means of political pressure.
For its part, Germany supported Poland's efforts to stop the flow of migrants trying to enter the country from Belarus.
Berlin has stated that it will help Warsaw and Brussels to resolve this crisis.
The judicial system of Poland, however, remains one of the reasons for disagreements.
The European Court has fined Poland, finding that judicial reforms carried out by the right-wing Law and Justice party violate EU law.
Poland has refused to pay the fine and its highest court has ruled that national law takes precedence over EU rules.
Germany's new government, sworn in on Wednesday, has not publicly committed to halting the Nord Stream 2 project in the event of a Russian invasion of Ukraine, despite demands from Poland and the United States.
U.S. officials have told members of Congress that they have reached an understanding with Germany to halt the Nord Stream 2 pipeline if Russia invades Ukraine, a senior congressional aide said on Tuesday.
German officials have not confirmed the reports, but Scholz warned of consequences if Russia crossed Ukraine's border on Wednesday, a position endorsed by G7 representatives on Sunday.
Dmitry, look more carefully.
The view out the window is the same, and the size of the window has not changed.
The wall between the kitchen and the room was removed, so the second window is partially visible.
In general, those who are not familiar with the initial plan are in doubt.
And I know such apartments very well and I can see very well how it was remodelled.
Let everything be well with them.
It always amazes me when people write about ways to clean sinks, toilets, windowsills, and faucets.
You wash them once a year on Easter, or something like that, so you have to really scrub them clean.
Just don't let it get dirty.
The Ministry of Digital Development wants to give writers residencies
The future fund for the support of Russian writers will receive federal property that has been inherited from the Union of Writers of the USSR and the Literary Fund of the USSR.
Writing residencies will be created on its basis, the Ministry of Digital Development, Communications and Mass Media, which will be the founder of the fund, reported to "Parliamentary Newspaper".
The Ministry of Digital Development, Communications and Mass Media is preparing a draft presidential decree on the creation of a fund to support Russian writers.
The explanatory note clarifies that the fund will be entrusted to take care of, including, the targeted use and preservation of buildings and structures that once belonged to the Soviet Union of Writers and Litfond.

The draft decree requires that the Charter of the Fund reflect that it is “established for the purpose of promoting literary activity by creating the necessary conditions for the creative work of writers”.
“By ‘creating conditions for creative activity’, it is meant creating writer’s residencies based on the transferred property in different regions of Russia, where there would be comfortable conditions for creativity”, the Ministry of Digital Development, Communications and Mass Media explained to our publication.

Doctors warn of the dangers of long-term use of blood thinners after COVID-19 and before vaccination
Doctors Irina Yartseva and Sergey Tokarev warned of the dangers of uncontrolled use of anticoagulants after coronavirus infection with COVID-19 and before coronavirus vaccination.
The internist and immunologist, Irina Yartseva, said that self-prevention of the possible formation of blood clots after COVID-19 can provoke a stroke.
Yartseva explained that blood thinners are not for everyone, only if the patient was hospitalized, was in a hospital, and had complications.
The doctor prescribes anticoagulants (blood thinners that prevent excessive clot formation) as indicated.
She reported that now there is a dark age - everyone is drinking anticoagulants for a long time and getting complications in the form of hemorrhagic strokes (bleeding in the brain) as a result.
The chief health resort specialist of the Ural Federal District, the scientific supervisor of the Society of Preventive Medicine Specialists, Doctor of Medical Sciences Sergey Tokarev told URA.RU in an interview that Russians are now often taking anticoagulants indiscriminately and before vaccination against the coronavirus infection.
According to Dr. Tokarev, citizens are trusting dubious advice on the Internet and starting to self-medicate.
There are citizens who, by their own decision, start taking anticoagulants one week before vaccination.
And the doctors notice the bruises during the pre-vaccination examination.
He stressed that it is extremely dangerous to take any medication without determining the cause of any symptom.
Potatoes have been named a superfood for protection against high blood pressure

She was extremely dissatisfied because there was no "fancy" kitchen and "fancy" balcony.
The aunt, it would seem, has nothing to do, so she's looking at other people's apartments, and people are wasting their time.

The plumber who found money in the church wall will be paid $20,000
The plumber who found the money in the wall of the church in the US state of Texas will receive a reward.
This is reported in a press release from the non-profit organization Crime Stoppers of Houston.
The incident took place at Lakewood, a large evangelical church where Pastor Joel Osteen preaches that the faithful will be rewarded with wealth and prosperity.
In November 2021, plumber Justin Cooley was repairing one of the church's toilets and found, under the insulation, thousands of packets of cash and checks.
He turned the find over to the church and, according to him, didn't even get a thank you from Austin.
"I wanted to hear him say, "You know, Justin, you did the right thing.
We understand what you did and what you could have done," KPRC-TV quoted him as saying.
The discovery appears to be related to a theft that occurred at Lakewood Church seven years ago.
Then about $200,000 in cash and $400,000 in the form of checks that were stored in the church safe disappeared.
The money was insured, so the church did not suffer a loss.
However, a reward of $25,000 was offered for information about the criminals.
Justin Cooley could not claim the sum as the reward had already expired.
Despite this, the non-profit organization Crime Stoppers of Houston, which had initially offered a five-thousand-dollar reward and later received an additional twenty thousand dollars in a gift from the Lakewood Church, decided to reward the plumber's honesty.
He will receive $20,000.
Earlier, it was reported that the police questioned pastor Joel Austin about the money found in the wall of the Lakewood Church.
Tanya, her words, her actions - this is her characteristic "as a real person."
That is why there is such a negative attitude towards her.
It’s not that “she is financially significantly richer than all the writers,” as they write here.
There are people who are richer, but not all of them behave so brazenly, so provocatively as this lady.

A new case of human infection with bird flu virus has been recorded in China
A new case of human infection with the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus H5N6 has been recorded in China.
The RTHK radio station reported this, citing a notification from Hong Kong's health authorities, according to TASS.
The 68-year-old resident of Huaijzhou district in southern Guangdong province was infected with the disease, who kept poultry at home.
Doctors have assessed his condition as critical.
The world's first human case of the H5N6 virus was recorded in May 2014 in southwestern Sichuan province.
Since then, the number of such cases in the country has risen to 53.
In Brazil, citizens have been required to present vaccination passports when entering the country
In Brazil, it has been made mandatory for those entering the territory of the state to present a COVID-19 passport, in accordance with a decision by the Federal Supreme Court of Brazil (STF) judge, Luis Roberto Barroso.
This was reported by CNN Brasil.
Citizens with contraindications to vaccination are exempt from presenting a vaccination certificate.
The list of exemptions also includes people who have come from countries where the vaccine has been proven to be absent.
"The situation is even more serious considering that Brazil is a popular tourist destination for New Year's, pre-Carnival and Carnival parties, as well as other events, which suggests an increase in tourist traffic," said Barros.
Earlier, the Brazilian authorities imposed a five-day quarantine on tourists who have not been vaccinated against the coronavirus.
Scheme for full protection from COVID-19 revealed
In an interview with Ura.ru, virologist, doctor of medical sciences and distinguished Russian scientist Anatoly Altshtein revealed the scheme for complete protection from the coronavirus infection.
According to him, this can be achieved by an injection and the use of a nasal vaccine.
When given intranasally, large amounts of IgA are produced. When the vaccine is given by injection, this does not happen.
Immunoglobulin A protects the mucous membranes, so the virus cannot get into the body.
Inside, after vaccination, our bodies produce the most G (antibody) immunoglobulins.
And if you take both vaccines, you will get a lot of IgA and IgG immunoglobulins. But there is no decision yet on double vaccination," the doctor explained.
The head of the health resort for the Urals, Doctor of Medical Sciences Sergey Tokarev, in turn, stated that the main advantage of using intranasal vaccination in conjunction with injection is the possibility of no longer being a carrier of COVID-19.
He added that this would help, as the body's defences, supposedly, should be maximised in such a case.
Earlier, the Minister of Health of Nizhny Novgorod Region, David Melik-Guseynov, stated that the new wave of the COVID-19 pandemic will be caused by the spread of the new coronavirus infection among children.
According to him, this is exactly what is happening in other countries where the next wave of the pandemic arrived earlier.
Inna, hmm...
I spoke to the male dog (he died a long time ago) like this - if you are ready to exchange a warm house, food, affection, love, and games for a wet bitch, then go ahead.
But the piglet was trained and was generally smart.
I chose my company and went home.
In the video is a method that works 90% of the time.
It's not made up, believe me.
I stopped many of the owners from running after the dog, even though they kept saying that there were 200,000 of them running away (pooches), I took them by the hand and led them in the other direction.
In the end, the “200,000” chose the owner, and not the dog that was running somewhere there.
Mass protests by anti-vaxxers continue in Europe
In the Austrian capital, Vienna, more than forty thousand protesters took to the streets.
They have expressed discontent with the restrictive measures and the government's plans to make vaccination against COVID-19 mandatory.
From February next year, unvaccinated people will have to pay a fine of €3,600.
Spaniards outraged by the government's health policy held a peaceful march in Madrid.
Some held placards reading "This is a false pandemic" and "I will not be vaccinated."
A large-scale protest against sanitary passports took place in Barcelona, the capital of Catalonia.
In the autonomous community, the Covid-19 certificate is mandatory for access to bars, restaurants, gyms, care homes and nightclubs.
The decision to introduce sanitary passports was taken by the authorities of several regions of the country against the backdrop of an increase in the number of cases of infection with the coronavirus.
In Luxembourg, more than a thousand protesters demonstrated against the tightening of restrictions and QR codes.
The demonstration began peacefully, but then escalated into clashes with the police.
A group of protesters began throwing stones at the police.
In response, law enforcement officers used water cannons.
Nikolai S., even in Wikipedia, there is no consensus on this matter.
Kashcheva-Rudneva is also referred to as "the first Russian doctor, doctor of medicine," probably because she began her studies earlier.
Let's just not argue, I think they both deserve the title.
The only thing I agree with Zakharova on is that the Americans brought nothing but death and plunder to any country they appeared in.

WHO has already detected “omicron” in six dozen countries
The World Health Organization (WHO) announced that the new coronavirus strain "omicron" has already been detected in 63 countries.
A number of experts have already said that the spread of the new strain could have catastrophic consequences.
WHO reported on the rate of spread of the strain.
According to the organization on 9 December, the strain has already been identified in 63 countries in all six WHO regions.
This is despite the fact that it has only begun to spread actively since the end of November.
The WHO is also concerned about the rapid spread of the new coronavirus variant.
WHO experts express concern that, according to preliminary data, the new variant may be more widespread than the "delta" variant, also known as the Indian version of the coronavirus, which is currently leading in all countries without exception.
Prior to this, the Director-General of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, stated that the omicron strain is capable of having a significant impact on the course of the coronavirus pandemic.
The UK has also come to a similar conclusion.
Experts from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) believe that "omicron" will displace "delta" in the coming months.
And the number of those infected in the UK alone will amount to about 1 million. This is despite the fact that officially, "omicron" is currently infecting several hundred people in the Kingdom, and according to estimates, up to 10,000.
British experts are predicting tens of thousands of deaths from the “omicron” strain, and at the peak, more than 2,000 people will be admitted to hospital daily.
Something the British healthcare system will not be able to cope with.
The situation is complicated by the fact that, according to recent research, the effectiveness of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine against the “omicron” strain is 32 times lower compared to other types of the disease.
It is not yet known how the Russian Sputnik V will respond to “omicron” – this will become clear in the next few weeks.
The Gamaleya Center has just begun testing the Russian vaccine on the “omicron” strain.
Why do we need to see the stages of aging?
It would be better to SEE in more detail the performance of your exercises.

Or hands on the hips?
The curious squirrel, you are right, communication on the Internet is a completely different thing, it is easy and relaxed to communicate, and when you meet in person there is nothing to say.
And meeting a person in real life may not be what you expected, it didn't strike you - and that's where the attitude comes from.
When they meet their person, their attitudes will change.
And again, the Soviet period is called "the time of devils".
Then, people believed in God much more honestly than they do today.
And they were raised practically according to God’s laws (love your neighbor, don’t steal, etc.).
What is the ideology today? Money at any cost.
People like Globa don't have much faith (or none at all), but even if they do, the time of the devil came in the 90s...
Our St. Petersburg, or rather Leningrad, communal apartment on Bolshaya Zelenina is still in touch.
Of course, we are not the closest of friends, but we try to maintain a warm relationship with the older generation.
Perhaps this is connected with the fact that there were no guests in the apartment, rooms were not rented out, and the blockade brotherhood was not cancelled.
Unfortunately, we see each other more and more at funerals.
Lara Angelskaya, forget it!
Human babies, especially males, are strong, active, energetic, squealing, pushing, wrestling, fighting, just like their little "cousins" in the wild!
It's a shame that they aren't as soft as puppies or kittens, so bruises, bumps, and scratches are common, and not at all like a boomerang!
And why should they?
Did the brother push him, miscalculating the force?
And you have always been so dexterous that you have never accidentally hit anyone and you have never injured yourself?

Israeli Prime Minister Bennett announced the start of vaccinations in schools
Israel's Ministry of Health on Sunday began an emergency program to increase vaccinations.
As of the morning of December 12, vaccination against the coronavirus is taking place in schools throughout Israel.
Prime Minister of the Jewish state Naftali Bennett reported at today's cabinet meeting that the issue of vaccinating the fourth dose to citizens in the risk group will also be examined.
In Israel, mass vaccination of the population against COVID-19 began on December 20, 2020.
Israelis are being vaccinated with the Pfizer drug.
From 10 January of last year, those who had been vaccinated began to receive the second dose.
Vaccination of 12-15 year olds in the country began in early June this year.
Currently, more than 5.78 million people have received both doses of the vaccine, while more than 4.12 million citizens have received the third dose.

Seven people were killed in Brazil as a result of downpours
At least seven people died and 175 were injured as a result of heavy rains that hit the northeastern Brazilian state of Bahia and neighboring Minas Gerais.
TASS reports this, citing emergency services.
A subtropical cyclone has been raging on the border of these states since mid-week, causing the amount of rain in the region to reach 450 mm. A state of emergency has been declared in 25 municipalities of the state of Bahia, with some of them experiencing the most destructive floods in 35 years.
Several bridges, two river dams, and three roads have been destroyed by the element.
According to the rescuers, about 5,700 people were left homeless, and another 6,700 were forced to leave their homes.
The damage caused by the natural disaster affected more than 85,000 residents of the region.

$135 billion went to apps - Hi-Tech
In 2021, user spending on apps grew by 25% worldwide, and the number of downloads - by 8%.
The most popular in the world turned out to be various video services.
The most downloaded app was the video editor CapCut, and the most money was spent on YouTube.
Both the number of app downloads and user spending in them showed a significant increase in the period from January to November 2021.
The number of downloads increased by 8%, reaching 140 billion. User spending in apps has grown even more significantly: by 25%, to a record $135 billion.
Such data was published by the analytics company App Annie, which presented a report on the mobile app market in 2021.
In 2021 the global economy emerged from lockdowns and began the post-pandemic recovery.
“Will such a ‘return to the physical’ slow down the growth of the app economy? Not at all”, the report’s authors believe.
India is leading in terms of the number of app downloads, accounting for about 20% of all downloads.
It is followed by the United States (9%) and Brazil (8%).
As before, iOS gadget users spent more than Android users: 65% of all app spending was on iOS.
In 2021, the video editor CapCut topped the list of the most downloaded apps.
It is followed by two Indian applications: video service MX TakaTak and e-commerce app Meesho.
Telegram is also in the top 10 by number of downloads.
In general, according to the number of downloads, the most popular services among users are VPN services (two of them are in the top 10: VPN Master and NightOwl VPN) and services related to creating and broadcasting video (in addition to CapCut and MX TakaTak, two more such services are in the top 10: Moj and SnackVideo).
"Users spent the most in live streaming and online streaming apps," the authors of the report note.
YouTube is in the lead here, TikTok video service, Disney+ and HBO Max streaming video services, and the Japanese manga subscription service Piccoma are also in the top 5 in terms of user spending.
Telegram, Instagram, Zoom and TikTok occupy the first four places in terms of the number of monthly active users, and the fifth place is taken by the mobile version of Microsoft Office.
In Russia, the leader in the number of downloads for the year turned out to be the shopping app AliExpress.
Behind it are the Zenly service, which shows the location of friends, and the same old CapCut.
Also in the top 10 apps are: online karaoke StarMaker, online clothing retailer Shein, the Maps for Minecraft PE app, the DiDi online taxi service, the Pure Tuber YouTube client, the Dixy retailer app, and the Samokat online store.
People all over the world adapted to the pandemic by moving to a mobile life, which can be called one of the main conclusions.
The most successful sectors were those that helped people to be closer, both virtually and in person," said Lexi Sydow, head of App Annie's marketing research department, commenting on the results of the report.
The mobile gaming sector brought in $90 billion in 2021. The leaders in terms of number of downloads were casual and hyper-casual games, in which there is either no or almost no plot, and the video presentation is minimal.
Count Masters, Project Makeover, and Bridge Race made it into the top three most popular games in the world.
In Russia, the most popular games are DOP 2: Delete One Part, Going Balls, and Phone Case DIY.
Earlier, App Annie presented its forecast for 2022.
Among the main trends for the next year, the company's analysts named the growth in the number of TikTok users to 1.5 billion, the growing popularity of Generation Z financial applications, for example, the Robinhood investor application, as well as the further increase in the popularity of metaverse mobile games.

Russians have been warned about a new scam scheme
Criminals have begun to look for new methods of fraud in video messages.
Izvestia writes about this, citing experts.
According to Ivideon's Director of Products, Zaur Abutalimov, the main danger associated with the distribution of video communication tools is deepfakes.
In this case, the scammers create a fake video based on real recordings involving the victim.
Thanks to this, the neural network is able to exactly reproduce the peculiarities of the behavior of a particular person.
Abutalimov added that using deepfakes, criminals can call the victim's acquaintances via video call or create a video with a copy of the person for distribution with the purpose of extortion.
"Such fakes can easily provoke bullying, since a well-versed offender can place people in ridiculous, dangerous or compromising pseudo-scenarios," the expert said.
Varonis lead systems engineer Alexander Vetkol, in turn, noted that people psychologically trust others more when they see them.
He pointed out that this could create specific risks in the case of video-based technologies.
David, I'll add.
In what I wrote above, I emphasized that I bought all of this in a small town, where the local mentality did not allow me to wear a lot of makeup and wear short skirts, to show my stockings and tights on my legs.
It's a province, but the store HAD such an item.
In large cities, Muslim women were wearing make-up, and were showing off their behinds.
It's the same in Dushanbe, it's a big city, the capital of the republic.
There are many fashionistas, but there is no same cosmetics.
Five actions to help avoid diabetes listed
Problems with blood sugar are some of the most common in the world.
But some people don't give it much thought, and that's a mistake.
Diabetes can lead to serious complications and even death over time.
Preventive measures play a major role in preventing the formation of diseases.
For example, doctors recommend changing the drinking regimen - reducing the number of different drinks and switching to plain water has a positive effect on metabolism.
Sugary products raise blood sugar levels to dangerous levels when consumed in excess.
Therefore, the first step towards a healthy lifestyle is to stop buying sweets and keep them at home.
The appearance of the disease is not only affected by improper nutrition, but also by habits.
To reduce the risk of diabetes, you need to move a lot.
Specialists advise following a low-carbohydrate diet.
Such a diet not only helps to lose weight, but also protects against sharp fluctuations in sugar levels.
In order to protect against the disease of diabetes, it is necessary to eat a lot of fibre.
Dietary fiber fills the stomach and therefore promotes the feeling of satiety, the release of digestive juices and increases the absorption of food.

Doctor Pavlov spoke about the “weekend headache” suffered by workaholics
There are several factors that can lead to worsening health over the weekend
The reason for feeling worse after working days is often “weekend migraine”, explained well-known endocrinologist, candidate of medical sciences, senior research associate of the Faculty of Fundamental Medicine at Moscow State University, and head of the Systemic Medicine Clinic Zukhra Pavlova in her Telegram channel.
According to her, workaholics are most often affected by this, who experience headaches, fatigue and weakness on their days off.
Dr. Pavlov noted that, in addition to the fatigue accumulated over the week, there are plenty of objective reasons for the negative reaction of the body to a change in conditions.
On the weekends, our lives change dramatically.
"We sleep a lot, lie on the couch all day, probably eat more, and drink less," the doctor argued. "Because of the lack of coffee, a minor withdrawal sets in.
Overeating and not drinking enough water will cause heaviness and fatigue".
The late rise plays an additional role.
For example, if you get up three hours later than usual, you will experience a reaction called jetlag.
It occurs in travelers who cross multiple time zones.
In order to determine which of the factors is playing a decisive role in the deterioration of her well-being, Pavlova recommended keeping track of what changes the most on the weekends.

SA scientists say Pfizer vaccine has low efficacy against 'Omicron'
South Africa has reported low effectiveness of the Pfizer vaccine against "omicron"
Researchers in South Africa conducted a study and reported on the low effectiveness of the Pfizer vaccine against the omicron strain of the coronavirus infection.
According to estimates, it (the level of "omicron" neutralization) corresponds to (the level of) vaccine effectiveness of 22.5% against symptomatic infection, which... calls into question the ability of the vaccine to protect against infection, the text of the study published on the MedRxiv portal says.
At the same time, specialists clarified that the drug can save from a severe course of the disease.
Earlier, the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine predicted that the omicron variant of the coronavirus could cause a new wave of the pandemic in the UK with more hospitalizations than a year ago.
How much hidden sugar is in common products?
Sugar is not the best source of beneficial nutrients.
Its excess in the diet can lead to type 2 diabetes, as well as heart and cancer diseases.
Consumers should be aware that an unfamiliar word in a product's ingredient list may indicate a hidden sugar - an ingredient similar to sugar in terms of calories, composition, and glycemic index.
The label may list several dozen names, all essentially meaning sugar.
Some of the most common and frequently encountered names are glucose and fructose.
There may also be other types of added sugars such as dextrose (sugar made from corn), levulose (fruit sugar), molasses (black treacle), agave syrup, etc.
These are all the simple carbs that fall under monosaccharides and disaccharides, and they can be found not only in pastries, but also in ketchup, in hot dogs, in bread, and so on.
According to Rospotrebnazor, the most effective way to reduce sugar consumption is to eat whole and unprocessed foods, and to pay attention to the label and the many different names for sugar.
Different types of sugar vary in taste, but no matter what the ingredient is called in a product - syrup or nectar, processed or unprocessed, brown or white - it's still sugar.
It's not easy to calculate the exact amount of sugar as you have to take into account not only the amount of sugar listed by the manufacturer on the package, but also the fact that vegetables, fruits, etc. originally contain a certain amount of sugar.
Thus, the total amount of sugar can be significantly higher than indicated on the label.
German Chancellor Scholz: Gas will lose importance for FRG in 25 years
New German Chancellor Olaf Scholz stated that gas imports are losing importance for Germany, as the country continues its transition to a decarbonized economy.
According to him, Germany plans to completely abandon gas, oil and coal by 2045, and become a climate-neutral country.
"That is to say, in 25 years, the world will be such that the issue of transporting gas to the Federal Republic of Germany and Europe will play a different role," said the chancellor.
Scholz noted that Germany continues to be committed to transporting Russian natural gas through Ukraine in the future, as this resource is currently important for the energy transition.
He recalled that Germany and the United States made a statement in which Berlin's support for Ukraine's energy transformation was recorded.
Previously, German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock stated that the certification process for the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline continues.
According to the minister, it was stated in the course of the coalition negotiations and the discussion of the coalition agreement that European energy law should be applied to energy projects.
The diplomat also pointed out that the pipeline is not "in compliance with regulations" of the European Union.

Hackers break into Twitter account of Indian Prime Minister
Hackers have broken into the Twitter account of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
The perpetrators managed to publish a fake message.
It was reported that India supposedly recognized Bitcoin as a legal means of payment, as well as that the country had already purchased the cryptocurrency.
Modi's office asked that the new messages be ignored.
Representatives of the prime minister stated that Twitter responded quickly - access to the account was restored.
The Indian Prime Minister's page was already hacked in 2020, calling for donations to a fund using cryptocurrency.
In a referendum in New Caledonia, the majority voted against independence
The third referendum in New Caledonia, which took place on 12 December, ended with the same result as the two previous referendums.
According to the first partial results announced on Sunday, December 12 at noon, the majority of residents of New Caledonia voted during the referendum against the independence of their territory.
At the same time, the level of participation in this third vote became significantly lower than in the two previous ones.
According to the preliminary results published by the local authorities, 3.51% (2,755 people) voted "for" the independence of New Caledonia from France, while 96.49% (75,762) voted "against".
Turnout was 43.90%, with more than 80,000 residents of New Caledonia taking part in the election.
The France-Presse agency comments that "the outcome of these elections left no room for doubt", as supporters of independence called on voters not to take part in the vote.
As the initiators of the referendum, they opposed its holding on 12 December, considering that the new outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic on the archipelago prevented a full and "honest" election campaign.
Thus, this abstention opened the way to a third victory for the supporters of French New Caledonia, after the referendums conducted in November 2018 and in October 2020.
In 2018, 56.7% of residents voted against independence, in 2020 - 53.3%.
The separatists say they do not recognize the results of the last vote and will challenge them at the United Nations.
The French president, Emmanuel Macron, was due to speak on the outcome of the referendum at the Elysee Palace on Sunday, December 12.
The issue of New Caledonia's independence has dominated the final weeks of the French presidential campaign.
Several presidential candidates have spoken in favor of the territory remaining part of France, as it is "the last region of the European Union's presence in the Pacific Ocean".
"New Caledonia must definitely remain French," Eric Zemmour said repeatedly.
The same statement was made by the Republican candidate Valérie Pécresse, who in late October published a column in Le Figaro, calling on the Caledonians to remain French.
On his part, Emmanuel Macron announced in May 2018 that he would not take a position "because it is not his responsibility."
However, the president added: "France would be less beautiful without New Caledonia."
Prime Minister Jean Castex, for his part, expressed a "strong desire for the choice of the Caledonians to be the choice of France".

I insulted you a little bit, I'm still embarrassed, I'm ashamed.
Thank you for not turning your back on my channel.

Turkey tested the world's first drone with a laser weapon
The first drone in the world with a laser weapon was successfully tested in Turkey.
The "Eren" UAV was tested at a distance of 100 to 500 m, reports MIR24.
The device is capable of neutralising explosive objects at a distance using a laser.
The maximum flight height of the new product reaches 3,000 m.
After successfully passing the necessary tests, the drone will be put into service with the Turkish military, which will use it to destroy explosives without the involvement of sappers.
The agency emphasized that Turkey is among the six countries in the world capable of developing and producing its own drones.

WSJ readers criticize article on Russia-U.S. relations
Readers of The Wall Street Journal criticized an article by Professor Christopher Hartwell, in which he described his vision of relations between Russia and the United States.
The author of the material expressed concern that the West was allegedly sacrificing Ukraine to Russia.
In the article, he convinced readers of the danger emanating from Moscow, and made a series of insulting remarks about the Russian president, Vladimir Putin.
At the end, Hartwell called on Western countries to "stand as one front against Russia."
Readers of WSJ expressed their disagreement with the position of the American professor.
"There's a lot of false information in this article," RIA Novosti quotes one of the readers as saying.
“Europe is not ours to “lose”, and Ukraine is not our land.
The United States and NATO allies will never engage in a nuclear war with Russia for the sake of Ukraine," another noted.

A 5.2 magnitude earthquake occurred in the Kuril Islands region
An earthquake with a magnitude of 5.2 occurred near the Kuril island of Shikotan.
It is noted that the epicenter of the earthquake was located 231.8 km north-east of the city of Severo-Kurilsk.
The epicenter was located at a depth of 92.5 km.
Earlier, seismologists recorded a 7.5-magnitude earthquake in Peru, which injured ten people.

Ukraine will begin to produce new-generation jet drones
A new Ukrainian-Turkish plant will begin to create unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) of the ANKA type.
On December 11, the non-staff advisor to the head of the Ukrainian president's office, Aleksey Arestovich, reported this.
That is, they are able to act against air objects, against other drones.
Even against piloted aircraft.
They will have Ukrainian engines and the rest of the Turkish avionics: the body and so on," Dialog.ua quotes him as saying.
Discussing the main features of the ANKA drones, Arestovich explained that they are jet-propelled, not piston-propelled drones.
According to him, this is a new generation of drones after the Bayraktar, which exceeds it "in all characteristics".
The first batch of UAVs should be produced by the factory at the end of next year, concluded Arestovich.
The ANKA unmanned aerial vehicle was created by the Turkish Space Agency in February 2014.
Development of the drone has been carried out by the Turkish authorities in cooperation with a number of private companies since 2010.
The day before, the Ukrainian General Staff classified data on the use of Bayraktar drones and Javelin missile systems in the military operations of the joint forces in Donbass.
On December 6, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky announced that the construction of a factory for the production of modern military unmanned aerial vehicles had begun in the country.
According to him, Ukraine intends to use drones.
On September 29, the company Bayraktar Savunma and the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense signed an agreement to build a center in Kiev region, where staff will be trained, as well as tests and maintenance of the Turkish UAVs Bayraktar will be carried out.
The press service of the office of the Ukrainian leader called this memorandum a "big real step forward".
Two lions escaped from a container at the airport
Lions escaped in Singapore's Changi Airport.
This was reported by The Straits Times.
Two predators managed to get out of the container with seven lions, which arrived on one of the planes.
The publication notes that it remains unknown from which country they were brought to Singapore, and where they were headed.
One of the escaped lions lay on the roof of a shipping container.
The animals were unable to move away from it because of the protective netting installed nearby.
The stand-off ended after the arrival at the airport of staff from the Mandai Wildlife Group, which oversees all of Singapore's zoos.
They immobilized the lions with tranquilizer darts and plan to transport them to a quarantine facility.
Earlier, it was reported that in Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia, a lion escaped from its owner and wandered the streets of the city.
On the same day, the animal voluntarily returned home, people were not hurt.
Experts warn of cancer risk from vitamin B9
Studies suggest that an excess of vitamin B9, also known as folic acid, can lead to cancer.
The Daily Express warned about this.
According to specialists, there is strong evidence that people who do not have a folate deficiency are less likely to get certain types of cancer, in particular, colorectal cancer.
However, exceeding the necessary dose, on the contrary, promotes the growth of cancer cells.
University of Alabama at Birmingham professor and dietitian Beth Kitchin advises keeping track of the amount of folate consumed throughout the day.
The optimal dosage is 400 micrograms per day.
The risk of cancer increases only if one deviates significantly from this figure in either direction.
Kitchin recommends not taking B9 in tablet form without a doctor's recommendation, to be sure to monitor the dosage, and to avoid breakfast cereals with milk and other food products that contain folic acid.
Earlier, nutritionist Rachel Fine called folic acid a substance that slows down aging.
Since it is, among other things, found in avocados, Fein recommended that men over 50 eat the fruit more often.
In the UK, up to 75,000 people could die due to the omicron variant by April
British scientists predict that due to the spread of the omicron strain of the coronavirus, up to 75,000 people may die in England in the next five months if restrictions are not tightened in the winter.
The Guardian newspaper reported this, citing a study by experts from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), TASS reports.
According to the most optimistic forecast of experts, who are members of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies at the British Cabinet, by April 2022 the country will record no less than 25,000 deaths due to the omicron strain, and a total of about 175,000 patients will be hospitalized.
At the peak of the epidemic, hospitals will admit more than 2,000 infected people a day.
"Serious COVID-19 control measures may be needed to prevent overwhelming the NHS if the Omicron variant is more infectious than the Delta variant and the current vaccines cannot prevent infection," said mathematician Rosanna Barnard from LSHTM.
Previously, the UK Health Security Agency reported that if the spread of the omicron strain continues at the current rate, about 1 million cases of infection will be identified in the country by the end of the year.
At the same time, the omicron strain could become dominant in the United Kingdom by mid-December.
There are currently 1,898 cases of the Omicron variant of the coronavirus detected in the UK, of which 633 were identified in the last 24 hours.
Meanwhile, on December 9, the head of the British Ministry of Health, Sajid Javid, noted that in reality this figure may already be reaching 10,000 cases.
I wanted to write a smart comment, but I read up to this point:
"A fur coat obtained as a result of the unimaginable suffering of an unfortunate animal and its employment in a second job".

Demand for superyachts has grown by a quarter worldwide
This year's construction of superyachts and orders for next year are breaking world records, despite calls to reduce carbon footprints and combat climate change.
According to the world ship registry, the number of ordered yachts is 1200 units - a quarter more than last year.
In an era of climate change adaptation, it is hard to imagine that the number of people with the desire and the means for a £50m-plus floating fortress will not decline, says The Guardian.
However, there are more and more of them.
This year, 25% more ships have been ordered than in the previous year.
Brokers say they have not seen such a frenzy in the market in 20 years.
The first reason is that many people who can afford a yacht are afraid of getting infected on land and prefer to hide from the pandemic on board their own ship.
The second reason is also related to the coronavirus.
If before all these people went to the office and met with business partners in person, now the absolute majority of them work remotely and conduct negotiations via Zoom.
Broker Will Christie told the paper that shipyards are taking orders for new yachts for 2025 and beyond.
This means that customers are willing to pay more, just to have their yacht ready a year or two earlier.
"People just want freedom, and the super-rich could afford it," he says.
In the Western society, many people criticize such behavior of the rich and call it decadent.
The rich, say sociologists, do not want to understand that in times of deprivation, trips to space, life on yachts or flights on their own airplanes cause indignation in society, since the elite does not want to share the responsibility for climate change with the rest of humanity.
Economists are calling on governments to act and are proposing new taxes and rules for the super-rich, although they recognise it will be extremely difficult to implement given the mobility of money.
In the meantime, it is only the number of ordered superyachts that is impressive, but also their characteristics.
Of the 1200 ships, 27 have a stern length of more than 100 meters.
The Norwegian billionaire Rekke is building the 183-meter yacht REV Ocean.
Once launched, it will be the largest yacht in the world.
The yacht is equipped with a “lunar pool” as well as a submarine designed to explore the depths of the sea.
On existing superyachts, helicopter pads, open-air cinemas and, on some of them, like boxer McGregor's yacht, a platform for mixed martial arts have become commonplace. Professor of economic anthropology at the American University of Indiana, Richard Wilk, says that compared to the overall amount of greenhouse gas emissions, the carbon footprint of the super-rich is negligible.
But it has a symbolic significance, given that there are just over 2,000 billionaires in the world.
It's just another example of over-consumption by a very small group of people.
Scientists have found that the emissions footprint of billionaires is thousands of times larger than that of the average person on the planet.
If one person produces an average of 5 tons of CO2 per year, then the biggest polluter of the planet, Roman Abramovich, is responsible for 33.9 tons of greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere in 2018.
At the same time, two thirds of the emission trail came from his 162.5-metre-long yacht, Eclipse.
Even if the owner is not on board, the crew continues to pollute the planet.
The owner can call the captain and tell him to bring the yacht, for example, from the Mediterranean to the Caribbean.
Superyacht owners do not elicit sympathy from others when they, like Australia's wealthiest woman, Gina Rinehart, who owns mines on the continent, complain via YouTube that there is no place to dock their giant vessels.
It is also difficult to understand her call to build marinas for ships with a length of 50 meters.
Dangerous weekly alcohol dose linked to bowel cancer risk
American scientists have determined the amount of alcoholic beverages per week that increases the risk of developing cancer.
Daily Express writes about this.
Experts concluded that the consumption of four or more alcoholic drinks per week is associated with an increased risk of developing cancer.
At the same time, the risk of developing the disease increases with the amount of alcohol consumed.
In addition, men who drink moderately have a higher risk of developing bowel cancer than women.
Scientists cannot determine the exact cause of this type of cancer, noting only that certain factors lead to a harmful process for the body.

Dogs can understand words and phrases at the level of a two-year-old child
Many, and indeed all, dog lovers are convinced that these creatures are very smart.
But even they have no idea how developed the four-legged pets really are.
Over the years, biologists have conducted various experiments to determine just how intelligent animals are.
Although a dog's vocabulary is not as extensive as a human's, a new study has shown that a dog can respond in sequence to 89 words or phrases.
The scientists' findings were published in Sciencealert.
Dogs can't play chess or write poetry, they don't understand politics, economics or art, yet they often manage to outwit their owners.
Some breeds, experts say, show the best results in understanding human language, but there is not enough statistical data to make accurate conclusions.
For example, some breeds have traditionally been considered canine geniuses - for example, Labradors.
The scientists came to the conclusion that dogs are capable of logical thinking, and in terms of their ability to learn, they are not inferior to a two-year-old child.

Ukraine is ready for trade talks with the United States and Russia
The United States and Russia will “bargain” over Ukraine’s admission to NATO, analyst Alexander Kochetkov said in his article for the Glavred publication.
In his opinion, Washington and Moscow are planning to continue negotiations in the near future on US guarantees that Ukraine will not join the North Atlantic Alliance, despite the words of US leader Joe Biden about the right of countries "to join anywhere".
If you are offered something obviously unacceptable, for example, the sale of a close relative into sexual slavery, you will not negotiate, you will just send the offer away.
As for Ukraine, there will be bargaining," the analyst wrote.
Kochetkov added that Russia has no plans to attack Ukraine, and is seeking dialogue with Kiev.
“The preparation is conducted in secret, quickly, and they immediately move to offensive actions, and do not wait for the group to be discovered and for countermeasures to be deployed”, he noted.
China Stimulates the Development of the Railway Transport Industry
Advanced Chinese technologies have attracted the attention of companies from the United States, Germany, France and other countries at the 2021 China International Railway Equipment and Manufacturing Exhibition in Zhuzhou City, Hunan Province (Central China).
The core technologies developed by CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co. Ltd. enable the trains to automatically detect and diagnose technical faults, said the company representative Hou Zhaowen.
The high-speed trains running on the China-Laos railway, which was put into operation at the beginning of this month, have already been equipped with these technologies to ensure the reliability and operability of the rolling stock.
In the past six months, China has significantly increased the export of rail vehicles, and many countries in Asia and Europe are witnessing the "Chinese speed".
In May of this year, the first two-storey high-speed electric trains developed in China rolled off the production line of CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co., Ltd. and were intended for export to Europe.
With a maximum working speed of 200 kilometres per hour, the trains will operate on the railways of Austria, Germany, Hungary and other European countries.
In November, test operation of a metro train developed by the above-mentioned company for Turkey began.
The train will run on a metro line connecting the center of Istanbul with the city's airport.
The movement along this metro line will open next year.
This will be the fastest metro line in Turkey with a speed of 120 kilometres per hour.
"China's railway equipment manufacturing industry is one of the most innovative sectors with the strongest international innovation competitiveness," said Fan Yaoshan, head of the trade and investment department of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade (CCPIT).
"This sector is the main competitive advantage of Chinese production of high-end equipment in the global market," said Fan Yaoshan.
After more than 60 years of hard work, China has created an advanced railway equipment manufacturing system with a full range of supporting facilities and large-scale production activities through a series of independent research and development.
According to Fan Yaoshan, the country ranks first in the level of railway electrification and operational mileage of high-speed and urban railways.
A biologist listed the early signs of dementia
Candidate of Biological Sciences, Semyon Goloshechkin, in an interview with Sputnik radio, listed the early signs of dementia.
According to him, signs of future dementia may include forgetfulness, as well as a whole range of mild cognitive disorders, such as the inability to concentrate, plan, and reduced levels of abstract thinking.
Currently, there is debate about whether hearing loss can be both an early symptom of Alzheimer's and a risk factor for it, said the expert.
Golosheikin emphasized that the causes of dementia can be neurodegenerative disorders, head injuries, some infections, metabolic disorders, and a lack of certain vitamins.
He added that Alzheimer's disease and atherosclerosis of the blood vessels of the brain are the most common causes of this syndrome.
The biologist noted that to date, doctors do not know of effective ways to treat dementia.
Therefore, it is necessary to start its prevention in a timely manner.
According to him, studying a foreign language and active communication can help reduce the risk of developing dementia.
The WHO also recommends maintaining a moderate level of physical activity, regularly training cognitive skills through games and hobbies that require intense engagement of memory and logical thinking.
"There are recommendations for the use of various dietary supplements, however, their effectiveness and usefulness are still discussed in the scientific community," Golosheikin said.
“The World Health Organization recommends maintaining a moderate level of physical activity, regular training of cognitive skills and abilities through games and hobbies that require intensive involvement of memory and logical thinking”, said Golosheikin.
Earlier, a UK-based dementia research charity said the disease was increasingly affecting people in their 40s.
Doctors have named the early symptoms of Alzheimer's disease.
The first warning sign can be considered problems with vision, due to which the patient acquires difficulties in recognizing objects.
Another sign of developing dementia is aphasia, a condition in which a person cannot find the right words to communicate what they want to say.
A neurologist has requested that Saakashvili be sent abroad for treatment
The former president of Georgia, Mikheil Saakashvili, needs psychoneurological treatment and rehabilitation abroad, a neurologist, Otar Toidze, who is part of the medical council created by the ombudsperson of Georgia, told journalists.
His [Saakashvili's] neurological status is the leading cause of his illness.
Stable problems are problems with movement, coordination, and mood swings," said the specialist, noting that this is not beyond the norm and that the former president now needs to be sent for special rehabilitation.
"This is what we call neurorehabilitation and psychoneurorehabilitation, the possibility of which we did not find in Georgia", - noted Toidze, demanding that Saakashvili be treated in a special institution, which does not exist in Georgia.
On the evening of December 7, Saakashvili began sabotaging the receipt of medical care after penitentiary service employees subjected him to disciplinary punishment.
The Georgian politician was quick to have the punishment overturned and his rights restored.

Protests against COVID passports take place in Spain
Protests against the mandatory COVID-19 vaccination certificate were held in the Spanish cities of Barcelona and Valencia, according to the Europa Press agency.
In the capital of Catalonia, the number of participants in the action was approximately 3,000 people.
In Barcelona, COVID passports have become mandatory for going to bars, restaurants, gyms, care homes and nightclubs.
Many protesters came to the rally without masks.
The slogans on their posters accused the state of totalitarianism and called for respect for the choice of citizens.
In Valencia, vaccination passports will also be required to enter entertainment venues and restaurants with a capacity of more than 50 people.
Protesters in this city have declared a medical dictatorship and called the vaccination an experiment.
In Spain, since the beginning of the pandemic, more than 5.2 million cases of coronavirus infection have been detected, and more than 88,000 patients have died.
Russia is also planning to introduce restrictions for those who have not been vaccinated.
The government submitted bills on a unified QR code system to the State Duma on November 12.
It is assumed that Russians will be able to visit mass events, cultural institutions, catering establishments and retail outlets by presenting either a vaccination or recovery certificate, or a medical exemption from vaccination.
The same rules will apply for travel by train and plane.

A steep climb: How Chinese are becoming skiers
The Olympics should attract millions of people to the slopes and help create international-level resorts in the country
China hopes that the Olympics will not only attract 300 million citizens to participate in winter sports, which will help achieve the 1 trillion yuan target set by President Xi Jinping, but also promote the economic development of backward remote provinces.
The Taiwu Ski Resort in Zhangjiakou, located not far from the site of the Winter Olympic Games, is becoming increasingly popular with Chinese people.
In addition to the construction of infrastructure in the region, landscaping works are also being carried out: workers are planting trees.
The country has more than 700 ski resorts, but only 20 of them are large enough to host international level competitions.
In many regions of China, where the resorts are located, including Zhangjiajie, there are problems with snow.
The main task for the long term is to ensure a comfortable and interesting vacation at Chinese resorts so that all newcomers become regulars.
However, it's still a long way off.
Organizing committee adviser Justin Downs says the Chinese ski industry has changed beyond recognition since his last visit in 2007.
More and more Chinese people go to the ski slopes every winter.
Fiona, a snowboarder from Beijing, is one of them.
Despite the major changes, it will take many more years to create a ski culture here, says Downs.
Many resorts are located in agricultural and mining areas.
These regions still need to be actively developed and the necessary infrastructure for recreation needs to be created there.
70-year-old Gao Macong lives in Chunli, not far from the Winter Olympic Games venues.
He notes that there has been a boom in winter sports tourism in recent years.
Two years ago, a high-speed railway was built from Beijing to Chongli, and now none of the locals suffer from unemployment.
More and more shops selling clothing and winter sports equipment are opening in the country.
Restaurants with national dishes are opening on the slopes.
In Taiwan, there is now even a COVID-19 testing station.
China is seeking to create a thriving winter sports industry, with its athletes leading the way in major international competitions and its resorts and equipment reaching world-class standards.
More than 500 million people around the world could be pushed into extreme poverty due to the pandemic, WHO says
More than 500 million people around the world could be pushed into extreme poverty by the coronavirus pandemic, which has stalled human progress towards universal health coverage, the World Health Organization (WHO) and World Bank (WB) have said.
To mark International Universal Health Coverage Day on December 12, WHO and the World Bank have released two complementary reports.
In them, they noted that the pandemic has led to disruptions in the provision of medical services, caused excessive strain on healthcare systems.
In this regard, for the first time in 10 years, the immunization coverage of the population has decreased, the mortality rate from tuberculosis and malaria has increased.
WHO and the World Bank have stressed that the pandemic has caused "the worst economic crisis since the 1930s, making it harder for people to pay for treatment".
The situation is pushing more than 500 million people "into extreme poverty, because they have to pay for these services out of their own pocket."
In October, United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said the coronavirus pandemic has pushed more than 100 million people into poverty and more than four billion people have virtually no social protection.

Reuters: Taiwan minister cut from 'Summit for Democracy' livestream at White House request
The speech by Taiwan's Minister of Digital Affairs, Audrey Tang, at a panel discussion during the US-organized "Summit for Democracy" was put into a video-free mode, according to the YouTube recording of the summit.
The Reuters agency, citing sources, claims that the image was taken down at the request of the White House.
According to their report, the reason was a map where Taiwan was highlighted in a separate color from the People’s Republic of China, which considers the island its territory.
The map Ms. Tan was showing was compiled by a South African non-governmental organization, CIVICUS, and ranked countries around the world by how well they protected civil liberties.
Taiwan was marked green on it as “free”, and the PRC, DPRK, Laos, and Vietnam – red, as “closed”.
After the minister showed the map, the picture from her side was replaced with a screenshot with the note that the opinions of the participants in the discussion "do not necessarily reflect the position of the US government".
China was not invited to the "Summit for Democracy".
Reuters sources note that the map shown by the Taiwanese minister could be at odds with the "One China" policy that Washington adheres to.
One source told the agency that after the map was displayed, the U.S. National Security Council angrily contacted the State Department, accusing it of showing Taiwan as a separate country.
The Washington-organized “Summit for Democracy” took place from 9 to 10 December with the participation of representatives of 110 countries and territories, as well as civil society and charitable organizations.
Russia was not invited to the summit.
During the “zero day” of the summit, the Nobel Peace Prize laureate and editor-in-chief of Novaya Gazeta, Dmitry Muratov, called for the creation of an international fund through which money obtained through corruption would be donated to charity.
Earlier today, Deputy Secretary of the Russian Security Council, Yuri Averianov, stated that the summit carried an “anti-Russian and anti-Chinese charge”.
They feed you the information that they are preparing the food, and everywhere there is rotten meat. In fact, the meat remains with the butcher to the very last piece.

The ‘Royal Childhood’ collection is one of the most extensive and well-known collections of children’s silver in Russia.
It contains a host of charming models of silver spoons, forks and knives, rattles and pacifiers, sippy cups and mugs.
All children's silver items are subject to strict quality control.
Environmentally-friendly silver, produced directly at the factory, and careful hand-polishing with cotton rolls make the products absolutely safe for a child.
Thanks to the disinfecting properties of silver, regular use of silver utensils can support the body's natural immune system and even prevent some of the common childhood diseases.
The specialists at the factory received a grant to apply a complex but very beautiful guilloche technique, which was used by the famous Carl Faberge.
This allowed the creation of surprisingly vivid and three-dimensional images on the products.

The New Shepard spacecraft with six tourists on board made a suborbital flight
Blue Origin's New Shepard spacecraft with six tourists on board made a suborbital flight on Saturday, 11 December.
The journey, broadcast on the company’s website, lasted more than ten minutes in total, after which the capsule with passengers landed on Earth, TASS reports.
The launch of the carrier rocket took place from the cosmodrome in the region of the American city of Van Horn (the state of Texas).
The ship climbed to an altitude of just over 100 km, and the space tourists found themselves in a state of weightlessness.
The launch vehicle itself landed on the launch pad at the spaceport.
Blue Origin successfully completed the first suborbital flight of the New Shepard spacecraft with passengers on board on 20 July.

But if that is ruled out, what right do you have to condemn them?

China has strengthened the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic in cities where land ports are located
The Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism of the State Council of the People’s Republic of China has issued a circular to strengthen the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic in cities where land ports are located to further prevent the importation of the infection from abroad.
According to the notice, people leaving the designated cities must provide a negative result of a COVID-19 nucleic acid test obtained within 48 hours before departure.
Those arriving in cities with land border crossings must take at least one COVID-19 nucleic acid test upon arrival.
The document says that these requirements will be in effect from the day the relevant provincial-level administrative units determine and publish the zones of these cities, up to March 15, 2022.
In addition, it is noted that cities with land border crossings and which meet certain conditions may consider the possibility of creating buffer zones for the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic within their jurisdiction.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has reported a “sad outcome” in the relations between Russia and the United States
Deputy Head of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Sergei Ryabkov, in an interview with Izvestia, assessed the prospects of relations between Moscow and Washington.
He noted that the long history of interaction has led to sad conclusions, and the problems between the two countries did not start yesterday.
One-sided negative predictability exists, but in terms of any kind of improvement in relations, everything is completely unpredictable.
It's a sad conclusion at the end of a long journey that we've been on with this administration, and with Trump, and with Obama.
The problems didn't start yesterday," the diplomat pointed out.
According to Ryabkov, the problem is due to the desire of the United States to impose their approaches on Russia on a variety of issues.
The deputy head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs added that he would not have dared to make optimistic forecasts about the prospects for improving relations and would not have expected a change in Washington's position.
He explained that, with the exception of areas such as strategic stability and cybersecurity, no progress has been observed.
At the same time, Russia calls on the United States to take a responsible approach in matters of international security and hopes that the signals will be heard and the Americans will listen to the arguments of common sense.
Earlier, the head of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Sergey Lavrov, at a meeting with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, stated that Moscow was ready to restore dialogue with the United States.
Virologist warned of the danger of vaccinating with a nasal COVID drug outside of a hospital
Those who receive the nasal COVID-19 vaccine may experience an allergic reaction and require medical assistance, so the first vaccination points for this drug should not be set up in airports and shopping centres.
This was reported by TASS virologist, corresponding member of the Russian Academy of Sciences, head of the laboratory of bio-nanotechnology, microbiology and virology of Novosibirsk State University, Sergei Netesov.
It is easier to organize vaccination points with a nasal vaccine in airports and shopping malls, but I would do it only in medical facilities at first.
The fact is that there is a chance of an allergic reaction to such a vaccine, it is small, but it is desirable that the person sit next to the doctor's office afterwards.
Doctors have special sets of anti-allergy drugs that work in a minute or two, which is sometimes very necessary," said Netesov.
According to the virologist, it will be possible to think about vaccination in shopping centres when there is experience in using the drug.
He also stressed that when using the nasal vaccine, it is important that it reaches the mucous membrane in the nasal cavity.
However, there is a possibility that the vaccine will not reach its destination if the person being vaccinated blows their nose after the injection if they have a blocked nose.

Alexander M., Can you remind me how the marathon went at the 2021 World Championships?

Attention, question - what is Klebo doing to the right of Bolshunov, and how does he want to get onto the ski run if he was behind at the turn before the gate?
And a "best finisher" over 1.5 km and after 50 km are two different things.
It was a long time ago...
I was there, and in fact, I wasn't even the driver.
He had the rights, but he didn't know how to drive.
They offered to drive 250 km in one direction on the MAZ!
Young, bad, agreed.
The owner is nearby, he's drinking vodka, and I'm driving.
First, as a king, he occupied the central axis!
A column formed up behind me.
I missed.
Then the belt on the power steering broke.
Then we were stopped by the police.
It was an organized column, and their car broke down.
It needs to be towed.
The owner of the MAZ explained that he was drunk and the driver was inexperienced.
And to him - what are you drunk?
You don't stumble, you don't fall.
Ahead of us with the flashing lights and forward!
I think he can't get out of advertising, and he has every right to be upset.
Pevtsov is saying the same thing about the return of the retirement age.
All budgets have long been drawn up taking into account the billions of roubles not received by pre-pensioners.

The UK has recorded 1,239 cases of the Omicron variant of coronavirus in a day - RIA Novosti in Russian
Over the past day, 1,239 cases of infection with the new Omicron strain of the coronavirus have been identified in the United Kingdom.
This is reported by Sky News.
In particular, 1196 new cases of the ‘omicron’ strain were recorded in England, 38 people were infected with the new variant of the infection in Scotland, and five in Northern Ireland.
The total number of people infected with COVID-19 from the new strain in the UK has reached 3,137.
Earlier, scientists from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine estimated in a pessimistic forecast that 75,000 people could die in England by April as a result of the coronavirus outbreak caused by the "omicron" strain.
Peskov warned of the suffering of Western countries that are introducing anti-Russian sanctions
The press secretary of the president of the Russian Federation, Dmitry Peskov, commented on the possible introduction of anti-Russian sanctions in the event of continued “aggressive actions” against Ukraine, including due to the supposed “invasion” of the country’s territory.
“It is impossible to impose restrictions against Russia and not suffer the consequences yourself”, the official representative of the Kremlin stated on the Russia 1 TV channel.
Peskov claims that "everyone in the world understands this."
Earlier, it was reported that the United States was considering the possibility of introducing anti-Russian sanctions in the energy sector as a last resort.
In addition, Washington and the EU plan to impose restrictions that will make it more difficult to convert rubles into dollars for Russian banks and the Russian Direct Investment Fund.
At the same time, the head of Sberbank, German Gref, is sure that this is impossible.

New Caledonia residents reject idea of independence from France
According to the final results of the third referendum on the independence of New Caledonia, an overwhelming majority of participants voted to remain part of France.
French television channel BFM.TV reported this on December 12.
96.5% of those who voted were against independence.
3.51% of residents of the archipelago in the South Pacific supported independence from France.
2.99% of the ballots were annulled.
Voter turnout on this day was very low: only about 55% of the archipelago's residents went to the polls.
According to the experts, the low turnout is explained by the calls of the separatists to refuse to participate in the referendum because of the coronavirus.
Paris refused to postpone the date of the referendum.
In October 2020, residents of New Caledonia voted against independence from France in a referendum.
In 2018, a referendum on independence was already held in the region.
Most residents supported the archipelago remaining part of France.
New Caledonia is almost 20,000 kilometers from mainland France.
France claimed New Caledonia in 1853.
About 270 thousand people live on the archipelago, the territory has a special administrative-territorial status.
A 1998 agreement between Paris and New Caledonia's administration allows the region to hold a vote on independence every two years.

WHO preliminarily considers “omicron” to be less dangerous than “delta”
The World Health Organization (WHO) preliminarily considers "omicron" to be less dangerous than the delta strain of the coronavirus.
At the same time, there are data indicating a reduction in the effectiveness of vaccines against the new variant of COVID-19.
According to information as of December 9, “omicron” has been registered in 63 countries.
"The preliminary data and the significantly changed antigenic profile of the "Omicron" strain suggest a decrease in the effectiveness of the vaccine against infection and transmission of the variant.
According to preliminary findings from South Africa, it ("disease severity" - rare) may be less severe than "delta"", the WHO technical note said.
The organisation notes that so far, all registered cases of ‘omicron’ infection in the EU have been mild or asymptomatic.
At the same time, the new strain, according to preliminary data, spreads faster than the delta.
Russia has registered two cases of infection with the Omicron strain.
They were "previously immunized," reported the Gamaleya Center.
The head of Rospotrebnadzor, Anna Popova, stated that there is currently no reliable data that the new variant of the coronavirus is less dangerous than the others.

Ukraine has named four scenarios for Zelensky
Former deputy of the Verkhovna Rada Vadim Denisenko listed four options for the development of events for the President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky in 2022.
In his opinion, the head of state may remain without the support of the West, and, perhaps, will make compromises on Donbass.
Denisenko spoke about this on Sunday, 12 December, in a publication on the Glavred website.
The first option, which Denisenko called the "ideal storm," assumes that key Western countries will stop supporting Ukraine, reaching an agreement on the country's future without its involvement.
Such a development would set the stage for a deep crisis Kyiv could face in 2023.
"At the same time, there is a decrease in the price of key products that we traditionally export <...> internal protests and opposition to the government from key FPGs (financial-industrial groups. - Ed.)", the former parliamentarian added.
According to Denisenko, there is another scenario for the development of the situation - "war against all".
This prediction will come true in the event of high turbulence in world politics, in which the Ukrainian authorities will face a number of problems.
Because of this situation, the Ukrainian leadership may make compromises on Donbass, as a result of which there may be a confrontation within the country.
At the end of the summer, Zelensky's positions will weaken; the probability of such a situation, according to the former People's Deputy, is up to 50-55%.
The third option for the development of the situation in Ukrainian politics is a confrontation between groups of people who disagree with Zelensky and the president, which could result in the seizure of control over the power bloc and the implementation of “populist initiatives”.
In the course of such a variant of the crisis, Zelensky will begin “reformatting power”, added Denisenko.
Another scenario is the transformation of Zelensky into a “father of the nation”.
This can be caused by some kind of event that will be a strong shock to society.
"The event should be large enough to provoke a reaction from external partners and lead to an increase in support for Ukraine," Denisenko said.
Such a development of events is possible as a result of a natural disaster, a man-made catastrophe or the aggressive actions of Russia, the ex-deputy believes.
At the same time, the Russian side has already rejected any possibility of an “attack” on Ukraine more than once.
In Moscow, they noted that it was the Ukrainian authorities, NATO, and the United States that were increasing military activity near Russian borders.
Earlier, on 11 November, data from the sociological group Rating showed that the rating of the Ukrainian president had fallen to record low levels, amounting to 19.3%.
This is the lowest figure since his election as head of state.
Analysts have predicted a situation in which, in the event of the next presidential election in Ukraine, only 21.8% of the vote would be given to Zelensky, while 14.5% would be given to the former president of the country, Petro Poroshenko.
However, only 19.3% of those surveyed expressed support for the president.

Thanks to the author for the story about a great athlete, I didn’t know that Elena Shushunova had died, it’s very upsetting to find out such things.
I remember how I rooted for her at the Olympics in Seoul, for us, residents of Primorsky Krai, it was a live broadcast, real time.
Such a furor, the emotions were off the charts, I remember the joy when Elena won.
They were also happy about all the other victories, just like they cheered for Salnikov, for the football players, for all the Soviet athletes back then.
On TV, I once saw a documentary about one of the Central American countries, and there watermelons were rolled onto the ship’s deck like barrels.
The watermelons were of monstrous size.
I myself have worked many times in my youth on the collection and loading of watermelons in the Astrakhan region, and I have never encountered watermelons weighing more than a pood.
I buy watermelons that weigh 4-5 kg straight from the field and no earlier than the beginning of August.
Balconette bra with soft lace cups (size: 90E, color: beige, composition: 90% polyamide, 10% elastane, item number: 12008).
Balcony bra with soft lace cups, on frames.
The bottom part of the cup is reinforced with a non-stretchy transparent fabric.
The side of the inner cup, in the bra strap attachment area, is reinforced with non-stretchy fabric in a fold, without additional seams for comfort.
It is this element that allows the lace not to stretch.
The richness of the lace can be appreciated thanks to the festoon along the neckline and under the bust.
The vertical ribs on the side panels of the single-layer microfiber prevent the fabric from bunching at larger sizes.
I didn't like the article at all, it was nasty and venomous.
Walked up to people about whom you know nothing.
But now many people like to break people down to atoms.
I hope that those who comment will do so with honor and decency and that they are experts in everything.

The poet who was arrested for the action on Red Square: "You get 10 days for a quote from Evtushenko, here is the power of poetry!"
At the beginning of the week, 21-year-old poet Alexander Volchenkov was arrested for ten days.
An HSE student was detained at Red Square with a placard that had the hashtag #poetofrussiaismorethanpoet written on it.
This quote belongs to the writer Evgeny Yevtushenko.
A protocol was drawn up against Alexander for a repeated violation of the procedure for conducting a public action.
He was arrested for the first time on January 23 on Pushkin Square at a rally in support of Alexei Navalny.
"The goal was to draw attention to poetry in general, now interest in it, unfortunately, has been lost, to the decline of the general culture in Russia, and there is also little hope of inspiring unknown poets to write their poems online under this hashtag," Alexander explains.
We have reached out to the young poet to find out the circumstances of his arrest and to learn more about the message of his message.
How did the police officers treat you during your arrest this time and in the past?
What did they ask at the department, how did they comment on your action?
This time, the employees were more polite, the arrest was as polite as possible, as funny as it sounds in a certain context of this word.
The OMON officers took people at Pushkinskaya, and they took them by force.
They asked the standard questions about motivation.
When we heard it, we basically looked, if not approvingly, then understandingly.
With the exception of the blowhole on all four sides of the monkey, everything was perfectly correct, but I knew what I was getting myself into.
And if, after the action under this hashtag, at least a few people start to write their own poems, I won't have spent those 10 days in vain.
Maxim, according to the protocol, talk to each other in private, even in the language of the Tumba-Yumba tribe.
And at public and official events, they speak in the language of the people around them, so that everyone can understand what happened in the Bundestag on 25 September 2001, or in their native language with an interpreter.
It’s a protocol, and nothing more, by the way, Angela Merkel speaks Russian very well and still uses a translator.
And at official events, a stenographer still takes notes the old-fashioned way with a pen, and the stenographer is not required to know several languages.
If you don't want to hear a lot of words, just say no!
But there’s so much water.
Well, go as a tourist for six months "to the Andes, then to Nepal".
Prior to this, convert all assets into liquid shares.
And gradually sell off these shares, opening an account at any bank in the world.
Sell in currencies that are less dependent on the U.S., such as Swiss francs.
And then you can file for a divorce from America.
However, this is not all that keeps Americans in the United States.
It keeps them confident that the U.S. is better than anywhere else.
This is how they are grown.

Researchers explain how potatoes help combat age-related disorders
The study showed that potatoes are rich in vitamins and trace elements that help to improve blood circulation and lower cholesterol levels.
The root vegetable contains B-group vitamins, vitamin C, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, riboflavin, folic acid, and pantothenic acid.
All of these elements help the body's systems to function.
In addition, potatoes help in the fight against age-related disorders.
Its high fibre content makes it good for the digestive system, and regular consumption can also help to prevent hypertension and atherosclerosis.
However, for the greatest benefit, the root vegetable is best stewed or boiled, rather than fried in oil.
The Daily Express previously warned that potatoes can be dangerous for diabetics, along with other high glycemic index foods.
These are foods that contain carbs that quickly break down into sugar, such as sugar, sweet sodas, white rice, and white bread.
At the beginning of December, the Kommersant newspaper warned of a possible shortage of Russian table potatoes, noting a decline in its production in private subsidiary farms and an increase in processing capacity.
According to market participants, the current shortage of products can only be met by imports.
Lostfilm, lordfilm and other pirates will be removed from "Yandex's" search results
Candidates for the exit
In 2015, rights holders from the RAEK/Media cluster compiled a list of the 100 largest pirate sites on the Russian Internet, and most of them ceased to exist, says Karen Kazaryan, CEO of the Institute for Internet Research.
However, Kinogo, Lostfilm, and Filmix have managed to survive, in part, by regularly changing their domain names, he adds.
For example, Lostfilm, which is available in the search results of both Yandex and Google, can be used to watch pirated copies of the Netflix series "Squid Game" and "Tenderness" by director Anna Melikyan - the original series of the largest video service in Russia, ivi (which is part of AIV).
On Kinogo, which is also available in search engine results, you can watch the animated new release “Encanto”, but, judging by the video quality, this is what is known as a screencap (a pirated copy of the movie filmed in a movie theater).
The series "Univer. 10 Years Later" on the TNT channel (which is part of Gazprom-Media) is available on Filmix, which can also be found through search engines.
Svetlana M., of course, I'm sorry, but I would not care if the son was offended for his mother or not.
If we have some sort of misunderstanding, it's better not to get involved at all, and to get out of the way.
Of course, it's good that this happens rarely.

Lyudmila, the cutting-edge space technology is currently in China.
Russia is already hopelessly behind.
"This idea developed by the Poles" - it would be more accurate to say that Poland only adapted the idea of 1776 for itself, but developed it quite effectively.
In fact, the slogan “The periphery is not Russia” appeared in 1848.
In general, this does not really change the essence of the matter.
I watched her interview, the girl said that her biggest dream is to have wings grow on her, her dad is constantly discouraging her.
Well, in short, all of this is very doubtful.
Well, you enroll in a university, and then what?
Maytoni MOD081WL-L13G3K Tessara wall lamp.
The wide circle, framed by ‘molecules’ of light, provides the most even and bright illumination of the space.
“Atomic” or “molecular” design, reflecting the nature and natural essence of each item, remains relevant and allows you to set interior accents to advantage.
One of the distinctive features of such lamps is the weightlessness of the design.
With the help of thin, almost invisible wires that can be adjusted in height, the impression is created that the chandelier is hovering in the air.
The metal gold armature and the matte white mini-chandeliers will easily complement any color scheme, and the pendant chandelier and sconces featured in the collection will be a ready-made ensemble for lighting the living room, bedroom, and hallway.
Well, it's all a matter of taste and color, as they say.
I really liked “Tarhun”, not the current one, of course.
The freshly squeezed juices from the tall glass cylinders were very tasty.
Three helpings of syrup are overkill, in my opinion.
Two was just right.
Dimatex Micro Ultimate mattress, size 160x190
Micro Ultimate orthopedic spring mattress.
The model is convenient because it has two surfaces with different degrees of softness - high stiffness and slightly more than average.
Only high-quality and premium fillers were included in the product, which have proven themselves to be only on the best side.
The springs: in the center of the model, a block of independent "micropack" springs is installed.
This means that there are 2,000 springs per sleeping area, which work independently of each other.
It is their functioning that provides the unique point-by-point adjustment.
"Micropack" is the highest frequency of all the variety of spring blocks from Dimax, so it has a pronounced orthopedic effect and is considered premium.
Fillers: Combinations of layers of coir and natural latex are installed above and below the springs.
The only difference is the order of the tiles.
If one surface has latex, the other has coconut coir.
Such a combination of fillers has long carried the status of a classic, since it gives the mattress not only orthopedic, but also anatomical properties.
If a coil mattress provides proper back support, then latex gives surface adaptation to the shape of the human body.
Cover: the model comes with a knitted Aloe Vera cover.
At the client’s request, it can be made either removable or stationary.
The total height of the product is 27 cm, the recommended load on the bed is 170 kg.
Guarantee and security: the guarantee period is 3 years.
The mattress has received all the necessary certificates and documents that confirm its full safety and reliability in use.
The orthopedic foam used in the mattress is CertiPUR certified.
Estonian scientists will search for life on Venus
The Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in collaboration with the Tartu Observatory and other research institutions and companies, is preparing three space missions to Venus to search for signs of life in the atmosphere, Aktuaalne kaamera reported on Sunday.
The aim of the five-year missions is to assess the suitability of Venus's clouds for life and then search for life there.
For the project, the Tartu scientists have proposed instruments for measuring the acidity and oxygen content of Venus's clouds.
Until now, it has been assumed that the clouds of Venus, the planet closest to Earth, were too acidic for life to exist there, but it is likely that Venus was originally an earth-like planet.
A sample from Venus is expected to arrive during the third mission.
If we find life there, the main question will be whether it's similar to Earth life or different.
If it's very similar, it will be clear that life on Earth didn't start on Earth.
If it is different, then it is more likely that life started on Earth," explained the head of the Estonian team of the Venus Life Finder project, Mihkel Payusalu.

Metaverses will change Russian business
The metaverse became a hot topic this fall when Mark Zuckerberg announced Facebook's rebrand to Meta.
This event was an important signal for the market: the largest player confirmed the development of a new format of digital interaction between people.
And this means that business in Russia, as in the rest of the world, will invest in creating their own metaverses and their subsequent monetization.
The metaverse should be considered as a continuation of objectively existing trends.
On the one hand, there is a trend towards creating distance interactions in the conditions of the pandemic, because people are tired of isolation and restrictions.
On the other hand, this is the result of businesses seeking to develop ecosystems and adapt operational models to them.
The third ones are a logical continuation of the trend of digitizing assets, when any rights, securities, works of art, and even money are converted into a digital format.
Anna, you're right, changing your diet is a conscious process.
When you start eating right, you no longer want anything too fatty or unhealthy.
Of course, we will have the traditional Olivier salad and herring under a fur coat for the holiday, but no one is forcing me to eat it all at once.
You can eat it by the spoonful, try it, and that's enough.
After all, there are really ten days off ahead, so you can prepare any tasty and healthy dishes.
And how much hellish hard work, time and resources she had to put into her training.
And after landing five quadruple jumps, she was left without gold.
And she also understands that she won't make it to the next Olympics in four years, i.e. she will never be an Olympic champion.
And anyone who hasn't played a sport or can't imagine the hell she's been through, DON'T JUDGE.
The British economist failed to make a forecast for 2022
The British economist Jim O'Neill was unable to make a prediction for 2022, since, in his opinion, such attempts will end in failure.
He wrote about this in an article for Project Syndicate.
The expert believes that the next year will be full of unpredictability and any trend can change the turnover.
The most important factor remains the coronavirus pandemic, and inflation is second, he believes.
O'Neill also admitted he did not know if price rises were temporary or not.
As the expert pointed out, even before the pandemic, it was clear that "the world of infinite generosity of central banks has run its course" and it was time to return to a relationship where interest rates, taking into account inflation, would correlate with expected GDP growth rates.
O'Neill noted that, amid the pandemic, continuing the ultra-loose economic policy could, according to some experts, lead to a new wave of inflation.
In addition, attention should be paid to the issue of productivity growth, as well as the increase in poverty and climate change, concluded O'Neill.
Earlier, the head of the Global Research Department at Otkritie Investment Mikhail Shulgin reported that positive expectations for the dollar exchange rate in 2022 remain, but the potential for growth will be less significant.
Shulgin named the monetary and credit policy of the Federal Reserve, the dynamics of oil prices, and concerns in the face of the coronavirus pandemic as risks for the value of the dollar.
I'm forced to agree.
But one thing is pleasing: if we compare ourselves with ourselves, then five years ago there were fewer containers.
It's better now.
There is progress, but it is slow.
There's another problem: there are a lot of environmental initiatives in cities, but people don't know about them.
Any kind of eco-taxi that picks up waste from home.
Yes, a recycling drop-off point is used by the dregs of society.

They're not releasing "The Pilot", and "Romashka" isn't the same at all...

Russians gave car dealers about 4.5% of the country's GDP
According to the results of 10 months of 2021, Russians spent 2.784 trillion rubles on the purchase of new cars, which is 28% more than during the same period last year, according to statistical data from the Russian Automotive Market Research (RAMR) agency.
To put it in perspective, about the same amount (around 3 trillion rubles) was spent by the state to support citizens and the economy during the coronavirus pandemic.
In September of last year, at a meeting of the heads of state of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, President Vladimir Putin said that such an amount is comparable to more than 4.5% of the country’s gross domestic product (GDP) for 2020.
In terms of income, the Korean brand Kia leads the Russian market.
During the 10 months of this year, he managed to sell cars worth 325.7 billion rubles, which is almost 24% more than a year earlier.
For the related Kia brand, Hyundai’s growth is even greater - more than 35%, and revenue from the sale of cars is estimated at 279.3 billion roubles.
This brand is leading in terms of the increase in the average price of a car - over the year, the average price of a Hyundai car increased by almost 21%, to 1.94 million roubles - only Changan, Chery, Geely and Mercedes-Benz had a stronger increase in prices.
At the same time, sales volumes for the Korean brands did not increase as significantly: according to statistics from the Committee of Automobile Manufacturers of the Association of European Businesses in Russia, in quantitative terms, Kia sold 9.4% more cars during the same period than in the previous year.
Hyundai - by almost 12%.
The Japanese Toyota closes the top three leaders in terms of sales volume in monetary terms: Russians spent 275.5 billion rubles on cars of this brand in 10 months, which is 14% more than a year earlier.
The Japanese are followed by Mercedes-Benz with a figure of 266.1 billion rubles (+75%) - the German premium brand has seen both its sales volume (by 37%) and the average weighted price of a car (almost 28%, up to 8.2 million rubles) increase.
"At the same time, Mercedes-Benz is experiencing a good growth in sales and average price - more, for example, than BMW - which is why there is a greater growth in financial capacity," explained NAPI CEO Tatyana Arabadjieva.
In terms of sales growth, Chinese brands are demonstrating fantastic figures, as well as significantly increasing their financial capacity this year".
Russian Lada, in terms of revenue growth, is showing average market indicators (plus 28%), with Russians spending 229.4 billion rubles on cars of this brand over 10 months.
Companies whose car sales in units fell in 2021 remain at the level of the previous year in terms of financial capacity: in particular, Volkswagen, Mitsubishi and Nissan.
UAZ is actually in the red - over 10 months, Russians spent 12 billion roubles on off-road vehicles and pickups of this brand, against 12.4 billion roubles a year earlier.
Against the backdrop of problems with the supply of automotive components and disruptions in production that have affected the entire global automotive industry, car companies continue to continuously adjust prices - the same AvtoVAZ increased the cost of Lada models seven times in a year, the last price increase (by 8-10 thousand rubles) took place at the end of November.
Other automakers regularly change the price tags on their products.
The size of the Russian automotive market in monetary terms will continue to grow - in addition to the shortage of cars, inflation and the desire of automakers to make up for past losses are contributing to this, experts believe.
In the context of a shortage of cars, I think that many car manufacturers have even managed to pass on some of the costs of previous periods that they were unable to include in the price of cars before,
says VTB Capital auto industry analyst Vladimir Bespalov.
I believe that in financial terms, automakers are feeling very good right now, maintaining high sales margins".
An indirect indicator of this is the growth rate of car prices observed during 2021, the prices of new cars are growing faster than inflation, the expert specifies.
In the long term, the market will grow both in terms of volume and value, but mainly due to inflation and the increasing complexity of the machines themselves, predicts Bespalov.
As supply increases, opportunities to raise prices will be limited.
In monetary terms, the Russian car market will continue to grow in the coming year, even if the growth in the cost of cars slows, car manufacturers will be able to get their income from the volumes, notes independent automotive consultant Sergey Burgazlyev.
Given the high demand and low supply, car manufacturers are now trying to make the most profit from each car sold, says Burgazlyev.
It is not expected that there will be an increase in production of cars for at least the next six months, and in Russia the frenzy is further fuelled by the uncertainty of citizens about the future.
Against the background of the situation in the market, the cars turned out to be a good investment object - a car bought a year ago, even with mileage, can now be sold for more than the original price, the expert notes.
Biden spoke about the transfer of US military to Ukraine in the event of a Russian invasion
The United States leadership has never considered sending American troops to Ukraine in the event of a “Russian invasion”.
This statement was made by the President of the United States, Joe Biden.
"There were never such plans," the head of the White House said in response to a journalist's question about whether the United States had given up on such an idea.
Biden noted that if the situation around Ukraine escalates, Russia will face economic consequences.
At the same time, he emphasized that the United States and NATO have no obligation to use military force to protect Ukraine in the event of an escalation.
The American leader also stated that the possibility of using American troops unilaterally for the defense of Ukraine is not on the agenda.
Biden explained that if Russia invades Ukrainian territory, the United States will deploy forces to NATO countries in Eastern Europe (Bulgaria, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, the Czech Republic, and Estonia).
"We will have to put more American and NATO forces on the eastern flank, B9 - all those NATO countries that we have a sacred obligation to protect from any attack from Russia," Biden said.
Earlier, the press secretary of the President of Russia, Dmitry Peskov, emphasized that Moscow has no intention of invading the territory of Ukraine.
At the same time, he pointed out that Moscow sees the problem in the combat use of drones supplied to Kyiv by Turkey, as well as in the fact that “American weapons are approaching our territory”.
I immediately leave such interviews.
If they already want to make me listen to screams, wait for hours, drink an incomprehensible drink and wash another cup at the interview, it's scary to imagine what will happen at work.
I'll find a normal place for myself, without the HR layer, where you can talk directly to the manager.

The mattress is ideal for both a single person and a couple.
The latter will especially appreciate the presence of a stable surface and the absence of the "wave" effect, when vibrations on one side of the mattress can be transferred to the opposite side, disturbing the sleeper.

If a fraudster calls from such a number, like a "police officer" or another law enforcement officer, then it is not effective to hang up immediately, and it is likely not possible to add them to a blacklist.
Because in order to confirm his lie about being involved in power structures, he quickly repeats the challenge and continues to intimidate and persuade.
We need more useful advice for the people.
That's just nonsense...
I don't really believe that it was like that.
They no longer know what to come up with, who to blame.
They got to the Queen.
And most importantly, in their opinion, everyone is to blame except for the very...

Perhaps all the strains of the virus will disappear...

Maria Kartashova, what does “in response to this” mean?
I, on the other hand, do not voice my thoughts. I mentally curse all of you.
I mentally behead everyone who didn't give me a seat, mentally send them to the curb and burn all the cars that are in my way, mentally all of them!
And from the outside, I can even smile for you.
But I remember that thought is material!
Peter, Nicholas II did not sign a single death sentence during his reign.
Even to lawbreakers like Koba and his gang.

A film by Alexander Sokurov’s student won the European “Oscar” for best editing
The Oscar-nominated Russian film "Unclenching the Fists" has received an award from the European Film Academy (which is also called the "European Oscar") in the "Best Editing" category, reports "Moscow Komsomolets".
The jury of the competition, voting online due to the difficult epidemiological situation, assessed the outstanding skill of the creators of the film.
The film by Jasmila Zbanic (Bosnia) “Where Are You Going, Aida?” received the most awards this time.
The main protagonist of the film is a UN translator who is trying to save her family during the war in Yugoslavia.
As for the film “Unclenching the Fists”, directed by Kira Kovalenko (a graduate of Alexander Sokurov’s workshop), this film tells the story of the difficult relationship between an authoritative father and his children, who are growing up and trying to break free from their father’s control in North Ossetia.
Earlier, it was announced that this film was nominated for the Oscar as the best film made in a foreign language.
As the regular friendly meetings of the presidents of Russia, Azerbaijan, and Turkey show, you, to put it mildly, are out of the loop.
Just yesterday, the President of Azerbaijan approved the opening of a joint Azerbaijani-Russian KAMAZ enterprise.
