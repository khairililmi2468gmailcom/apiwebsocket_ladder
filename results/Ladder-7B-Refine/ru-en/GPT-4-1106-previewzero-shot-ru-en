In my opinion, the literature program was formed by ladies of Balzac age based on their interests.
From Russian literature of the 19th century, we preferred Danilevsky and Volkonsky.
They wrote fiction, of course, from the point of view of those very ladies of a certain age.
And the psychology and the suffering of Tolstoy's and Turgenev's heroines are not so interesting for teenagers.
Teenagers are rarely interested in the psychology of the heroes.
Thank you very much, it was very interesting.
Perhaps the roses were made of plush to represent a certain variety of them?
There are roses of this colour and with this petal structure, resembling velvet, usually in dark red or burgundy tones.
And the light-coloured roses look different, with the petals having a satin or silk-like sheen.

The Promtex Micropacket Prestige 105х195 mattress.
The "Micropack Prestige" model: comfort and natural ingredients.
The mattress has different firmness on each side: the medium-firm side is made of latex-coated coconut fiber and natural latex, and the moderately soft side is made of a natural latex slab.
The 1000-spring-per-square-metre spring unit quickly adapts to the sleeper's body, preventing the "wave" or "hammock" effect.
Among the benefits of the model, it is necessary to highlight the breathable materials.
Latex, which is perforated for breathability, naturally ventilates well, as does coconut coir.
This maintains a healthy microclimate in the sleeping area.
The mattress is also covered by an extended warranty period.
The official warranty period from the manufacturer is 5 years, but in fact, the lifespan of the mattress is longer.
Dust and dirt protection is provided by a removable jacquard cover that is included.
To go with the mattress, buy an orthopedic pillow - it is recommended to maintain the optimal position of the spine during sleep.
The filling determines the purpose of the sides - the coconut serves as anatomical support for the back, the latex relaxes the muscles.
Use your brain and get rid of such relatives!
It's better to have none than ones like these...
Either find a third-party driver, or someone who is willing to invest and work with you as a partner.
If it doesn't work out, then sell the car, even at a loss, don't be stingy.
Next time, think better...
Andrey, you have been clearly explained that pensioners work in schools, they will not work in the command line.
The computer science teacher won't be able to help either, they didn't teach him that, the school kids are playing games in Windows.
So there is no support.
I remember with horror those banquets and guests in my parents' house.
The guests are at the door, and the cutlets are still being fried on the stove, and the mother is sweeping the floor.
Lord, he sat down at the table already without strength.
And then you have to wash the dishes and clean the house.
A week before the holiday you drag groceries, two days of cooking, a day of cleaning up after.
What about the guests?
They are doing well, and they always bring a cake with them.
Ever since then, I don't like holidays or guests.
Even for my family, I set the table with the bare minimum.
As for the treats, I cook them for them, I bake very often just for the sake of it.
Germany: Fourth coronavirus vaccination is inevitable
A fourth vaccination will be required in the summer or fall of 2022.
According to the expert, the current vaccination in Germany will not be the final one, but will continue with renewed vigour.
Despite an intensive vaccination campaign in Germany, two or three doses of the coronavirus vaccine will probably not be enough for full protection.
This is the belief of the head of the Association of General Practitioners, Ulrich Weigeldt.
Die Welt reported this on Saturday, 11 December.
"We expect that the fourth vaccination will be required in the summer, at the latest in the autumn," the expert believes.
In addition, Weigel hopes that the fourth coronavirus vaccination can be carried out "in combination with the flu vaccination."
This will help achieve the best results.
In addition, enhanced vaccination may help in the fight against the spread of the new coronavirus strain "Omicron".
Moreover, the new variant is particularly dangerous.
For example, the probability of reinfection with "Omicron" is three times higher than with the Delta or Beta strains.
This is evidenced by the results of a preliminary study conducted in South Africa.
Based on this, the BioNTech/Pfizer manufacturers plan to provide an Omicron-adapted vaccine by March 2022.
The companies emphasize that two doses of the vaccine do not provide sufficient protection against infection with the new Omicron variant of the coronavirus.
The BioNTech and Pfizer study showed that with two doses of the vaccine, the effectiveness is significantly lower: "the neutralizing potential is reduced by more than 25 times".
"This indicates that two doses of BNT162b2 do not provide sufficient protection against infection with the Omicron variant," BioNTech and Pfizer emphasized.
Therefore, a third dose is needed.
Experts insist on accelerating the pace of vaccination in the country.
For example, the chairman of the German Society for Infectious Diseases, Bernd Salzberger, is in favour of reducing the interval between the second and third vaccination.
Moreover, according to Salzberger, accelerated vaccination will affect the spread of both the delta virus and the omicron variant of the coronavirus.
"Israel's experience very convincingly shows this," the expert emphasized.
Pontoon21 wobler, Bet-A Vib, 54 Silent, 54 mm, 8.5 g.
The Bet-A-Vib series is a special branch of the Bet-A family from Pontoon21®.
It (like the Kalikana Vib series) differs from many other vibes in that it was originally designed for ice fishing, not just for casting.
These vibes have a higher specific weight than their counterparts of similar size, which, without a doubt, has a positive effect on the nuances of using these interesting lures.
Another recognizable feature is the top fin made of durable and flexible plastic, which creates additional shades of vibration during vertical and horizontal retrieves.
As a "winter vibe" for vertical jigging, the Bet-A-Vib demonstrates a fairly aggressive action.
Often the most effective is a simple monotonous animation, that is, movements of the lure up and down almost without pauses.
When planning, the deviation from the vertical axis is not very large, which is convenient for catching in a limited space, cluttered with underwater vegetation, snags, and other obstacles that can cause a snag.
In addition, a slight deviation is relevant when fishing for pike and large perch in winter, and especially in mid-winter, when a pinpoint and aggressive presentation of the lure is required.
Reaching the extreme point of its trajectory, Bet-A-Vib instantly reverses and returns to its original vertical.
Bet-A-Vib is no less successfully used for winter fishing for pond trout.
To satisfy her whims, you can choose from two modifications: with a noise capsule (NS – NanoSound) or without it (SL – Silent).
It is also noted that Bet-A-Vib is capable of irritating a passive pike that does not even react to a live bait.
When casting, the Bet-A-Vib demonstrates distance and accuracy.
This wobbler is easy to understand and not capricious, it goes well with both monofilament and braided lines even of large diameters.
For catching pike, zander, roach or perch, in addition to a steady retrieve, a "step" is also effective, sometimes with "chattering" along the bottom.
If you're fishing in snaggy areas, you can change the front treble hook to a double hook, which will reduce the likelihood of snags.
Among the lures of its class, the Bet-A-Vib is one of the most stable in operation and, as a result, one of the most effective.
It can be used with equal success on both relatively shallow and fairly deep sections.
All models are equipped with Owner ST-36 hooks.
How many young idlers are sitting on the necks of their elderly parents.
The "golden youth" are clearly slackers in the majority, unable to do anything and know nothing.

You must be joking.

7,000 Russian mercenaries have been reported in Libya
More than 7,000 mercenaries from the private military company (PMC) Wagner are in Libya.
This was announced on Sunday, 12 December, by the Chairman of the Supreme State Council of the Republic, Khaled al-Mishri.
"Currently, there are more than 7,000 Wagner PMC mercenaries in Libya.
They also have airplanes.
They are also digging trenches in Sirte and Kufra.
They have 30 fighter jets at the Ghardabiya airbase (which is also used as a civilian airport in Sirte)," the Anadolu agency quotes him as saying.
Khaled al-Mishri also pointed out that Russian mercenaries are "trying to take over" the central part of Libya, stretching from Chad to the Mediterranean Sea, after "bringing their man to power" in the Central African Republic.
Remain present
According to the publication’s source, Moscow was looking for a country to maintain its presence in North Africa and “settled in Libya”.
“Wagner” has been in Libya since 2019, using the airbase and port in Sirte, as well as the airbase in Jufra, the agency’s publication notes.
Russian authorities officially deny that the Wagner PMC is supported by the Kremlin.
Where else could the mercenaries be?
According to the agency, Wagner is allegedly operating in nine African countries: the Central African Republic, Libya, Sudan, Mozambique, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Madagascar, Zimbabwe, and Angola.
The company provides military training for local forces, personal protection for leaders and protection of energy facilities.
In exchange for these services, Wagner’s subsidiaries receive certain privileges and licenses for the use of mineral resources and natural resources, as well as for the supply of weapons, technologies, and military services to these countries”, the article states.
According to the media, the "Wagnerites" allegedly fought in Donbass, Syria, Mozambique, Sudan, and the Central African Republic.
This group is not listed in the security services or in the register of legal entities, and its fighters are absent from the official lists of personnel.
This company is under US sanctions.
Recall that earlier, the permanent representatives of 27 EU countries approved restrictions against "Wagner".
The Council of the European Union is expected to approve this decision on 13 December.
The situation in Libya
The Libyan High State Council is, in fact, a second chamber of parliament with consultative functions, dominated by Islamists, writes TASS.
This body has repeatedly called for the postponement of the single voting day for the election of parliament deputies and the head of state from 24 December at least until February 2022.
"There are less than two weeks left until the elections, and the chances of them being held on time are rapidly decreasing," the article notes.
Against this backdrop, the Libyan High National Elections Commission has indefinitely postponed the announcement of the final list of candidates, reports Sky News Arabia.
Foreign policy through the eyes of Russians
38% of Russians see more successes than failures in the country's foreign policy, 29% believe that failures predominate.
"Examples of success are "we protected and restored peace in Syria", "the decision on Nord Stream 2", "we scared the whole world with our powerful weapons", "we took back Crimea".
The main failures are “conflict with Ukraine”, “confrontation with western countries”, “isolation from the world”, says the study by the Public Opinion Foundation.
The government of Dubai has completely abandoned paper-based record-keeping - all government services have also become digital only
The Dubai government has announced a complete switch from paper-based administration to digital technologies.
All state services to the public will also be provided exclusively in electronic form.
This is reported by the Emirati news agency WAM.
"Today marks the beginning of a new phase of digitization of all aspects of life in Dubai - we have completed the transition to a fully paperless government," said the Crown Prince of the emirate, Chairman of the Executive Council of Dubai, Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum on Saturday.
Now, the internal and external document flow in all government institutions in Dubai will be carried out only in digital form through special information platforms.
The innovation affected all sectors without exception: healthcare, utilities, the police, municipal authorities, courts, and so on. Many commercial structures also joined the government’s initiative.
The transition to electronic government and the digitization of document flow began in Dubai in 2018.
During this time, the authorities have calculated that 336 million sheets of paper have been saved, which is equivalent to 14 million hours of human labor and $353.8 million in monetary terms.
Earlier, Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin stated that electronic services save citizens 2 days a year.
Dana, well, about the dates of birth and how old the child is, that's already dementia, about the class and group in kindergarten too.
I just don't believe that such louts exist.
And if they do exist, they clearly don't care about anything, including their families.
My mother, her two brothers, and her grandfather and grandmother lived at 3 Vladimirskaya; it was the first floor without bars.
They first knocked on the door, then on the window, then decided not to beat around the bush, broke the window and climbed in, but the grandfather had a baseball bat, which they received.
These people knew for sure that there was someone at home...
Turkey's car production and exports fall below 2020 levels
Turkey's car production and exports fell sharply in November amid the lira's devaluation.
As a result, the industry's figures for the first 11 months were worse than last year's results, reports Bloomberg, citing data from the Turkish Automotive Manufacturers Association.
According to the association, 115,000 cars were released from factories in Turkey in November, which is 20% less than a year earlier.
About 75,900 cars were exported, which is more than 25% less than last year's figure.
And if the results of the first 10 months of this year show positive dynamics for the Turkish automotive sector compared to last year, then the results of 11 months of 2021 show that car production is already 0.3% worse than last year's figures.
The reason for such a fall was the sharp weakening of the Turkish lira, which in November depreciated by 29% against the dollar.
This led to a decline in economic activity across all sectors.
More than 500 SMEs received a loan payment deferral in 2021
The First Deputy Prime Minister, Alikhan Smailov, spoke about the situation regarding the provision of benefits for small and medium-sized businesses, reports a correspondent for the Kazinform news agency.
"According to information from the Republic of Kazakhstan Agency for Regulation and Development of the Financial Market, in the current year, in accordance with the instruction of the Head of State dated April 1, 2021, the Chairman of the Agency's order dated April 9, 2021, No. 127 "On the approval of the procedure for granting payment deferrals on loans to small and medium-sized businesses" was adopted," Alihan Smailov wrote in his response to the deputy's request.
He reminded that the procedure for granting payment deferrals on loans provided for the granting of payment deferrals on loans issued by banks and organizations engaged in microfinance activities to SMEs, including sole proprietors, from April 1 to June 30, 2021.
The deferral period was from 30 to 90 days at the discretion of the SME.
The borrower's statement could have indicated a different payment deferral period.
During the deferral period for the borrower, the claims and legal proceedings were suspended, notification of the need to pay off the overdue debt, as well as the collection of fees and other payments by the creditor were suspended," the deputy prime minister noted.
In 2021, second-tier banks received applications for loan payment deferrals from 603 SME borrowers, of which 553 SME borrowers received deferrals amounting to 9.7 billion tenge.
131 SMEs applied for a deferral to the MFIs, of which 95 SMEs were granted a deferral for a total amount of 105.8 million tenge," concluded A. Smailov.
The pulmonologist Puryasev suggested that people with weak immunity are able to easily tolerate the "omicron" strain
The doctor suggested that people with a weakened immune system may be able to tolerate it better than those with a strong immune response
The pulmonologist Sergey Puryasev explained why the omicron strain of the coronavirus may be dangerous.
The reason is to be found in the conditions in which the virus originated.
Scientists believe that the "omicron" originated in the body of an HIV-infected or immunocompromised person.
That is, when it mutated, it did not encounter any resistance from the immune system.
This makes him more aggressive.
Because there was no immune response, it became very fast.
Apparently, it has more of these spike proteins, spikes, than it should, and its antibodies did not reduce them during the mutations, says pulmonologist Sergey Puryasev.
The doctor suggested that people with a weakened immune system may be able to tolerate "omicron" better than those with a strong immune response.
It turns out that a strong immune response to anything, any infection, is not always a good thing.
In such cases, the body can kill itself.
This is what happens with pneumococcal infections, when young people aged 30 die, and old people aged 60 can get through it with just a sneeze.
The immune response is wild in young people, it is completely out of control: where it would have been enough to just wave a finger, it is firing like a cannon at sparrows, - concluded Sergey Puryasev.
The doctor also reminded that the coronavirus has dangerous side effects and the most unpleasant of them is pneumonia.
Pneumonia can be bacterial or viral.
If the first is treated very successfully and quickly, in the second case, it is often only possible to treat the symptoms - all hope is on the body.
The first sign of developing pneumonia will be the beginning of intoxication of the body - this is a fever, weakness, malaise.
Then come the respiratory symptoms: difficulty breathing, a sore throat, a cough.
Pain on the right or left side, or abdominal pain, can also indicate a developing problem.
Meanwhile, in Russia, they may start vaccinating the younger generation aged 12 to 18 by the end of the year.
Virologist, head of the MIPT genome engineering laboratory Pavel Volchkov noted that this category is very actively suffering from COVID.
For children who go to school, the number of contacts is at its maximum.
This is the most socially active group, just like the children in kindergartens, said Pavel Volchkov, a virologist and head of the Laboratory of Genomic Engineering at the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology, to Moscow 24.
Huge thanks to the author for this article.
I was happy to refresh my memory...
Teath-In.
In those distant seventies and eighties, no dance floor was complete without the melodies of this group.
And at home, when they got together with friends, they would dance to their music.
Immunologists have put forward a hypothesis as to why people with obesity become victims of COVID
The authors of the study examined the fatty tissue left over from bariatric operations and found that fat cells, known as adipocytes, can be infected by the coronavirus.
Immune cells located in the fatty tissue, macrophages, were also infected, and showed a strong inflammatory response.
The scientists also examined the fatty tissue of patients who died from Covid and found coronavirus particles in the fat surrounding various organs.
It is known that HIV and influenza viruses can hide in fatty tissue, using it as a reservoir, in an attempt to evade the immune system's response.
It is likely that SARS-CoV-2 is also capable of this.
A biologist spoke about the causes of dementia
The candidate of biological sciences, Semyon Golosheykin, named the causes of dementia and spoke about ways to prevent it in an interview with the Sputnik radio station.
According to the WHO, more than 55 million people suffer from this disease.
The syndrome is characterized by a gradual loss of cognitive functions - over time, a person with the syndrome has difficulty even in familiar surroundings.
Golosheykin noted that the most common causes of dementia are neurodegenerative disorders, head injuries, certain infections, metabolic disorders, and a lack of certain vitamins.
Some factors increase the risk of developing the disease.
This includes hypertension, diabetes, high cholesterol, obesity, depression and alcoholism.
At the behavioural level, factors such as social isolation and lack of active cognitive engagement are possible," he said.
Dementia is also affected by bad habits - smoking, alcohol abuse, sleep disorders and a sedentary lifestyle.
Among the first signs, the expert noted forgetfulness, inability to concentrate and a decrease in the level of abstract thinking.
"There is a debate that hearing loss can be both an early sign of Alzheimer's disease and one of the risk factors for its development," the biologist added.
To prevent the development of the disease, the WHO recommends maintaining a sufficient level of physical activity, training cognitive skills and abilities that require the involvement of memory and logic.
Earlier, the professor of the Department of Neurology, Neurosurgery and Medical Genetics of the Federal State Budgetary Educational Institution of Higher Education RSMU named after N.I. Pirogov.
N.I. Pirogov, head of the Department of Cognitive Disorders at the Federal Center for the Brain and Neurotechnology, Anna Bogolepova, spoke about the causes of memory problems.
Egypt has returned about 30,000 artifacts illegally taken out of the country
Over the past 10 years, the Cairo government has managed to return about 30,000 artifacts that were illegally smuggled out of the country.
This was announced on Saturday, 11 December, on the Al-Hayat TV channel by the chief inspector of the department of returned antiquities of the Egyptian Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities, Shaaban Abdel Gawad.
Since 2011, the Egyptian state has managed to recover 29,300 artifacts.
Just this year, 5,300 artifacts of ancient Egyptian civilization were discovered at the Museum of the Bible in Washington," he said.
Abdel Gawad clarified that all the smuggled artifacts are registered in the archives.
Currently, department employees are working on their return to Egypt.
In particular, specialists “track auctions around the world and online sales” through foreign and Egyptian websites, as well as social networks.
The chief inspector explained that the cultural treasures are restored upon their return and then displayed in museums.
He said one of the returned artifacts was an ancient human skeleton found in Belgium, which is now part of an exhibition at the National Museum of Egyptian Civilization in Cairo.
In 2020, the Egyptian authorities appealed to Interpol for help in finding a bust of the Pharaoh Tutankhamun sold at an auction in London.
The Christie's auction house held a sale on July 4, at which the 3,000-year-old bust was sold for $5.97 million (about 680 million rubles).
This has caused discontent from Egypt.
The Egyptian side also claims that the artwork was illegally taken out of the Karnak Temple in Luxor in the 1970s.
The head of Tutankhamun, depicted as the sun god Amun, had been in a private collection and had not been offered for sale since 1985.
It is unknown how the relic came to Europe.
Egypt has been actively seeking the repatriation of antiquities that were illegally taken out of the country at different times in recent years.
According to the authorities, 95% of smuggled antiquities are the result of archaeological excavations by "black diggers".
"The Crimean Tatars are not taken into account" - and this is correct, because the Crimean Tatars (232,000) are an independent people (closely related to the Turks).
If you want to add something, then only 42 thousand people - that's how many Kazan Tatars live in Crimea (see the census).
The Crimean Tatars are a separate people, and the name of this people consists of two words!
They are only united by the Turkic language group.
FT: Credit Suisse wants access to employees' personal mobile devices
Credit Suisse is requiring its employees to give the bank access to their personal mobile devices, the Financial Times reports.
The fact is that in Europe and the USA, the Swiss bank does not provide its employees with corporate communication devices, instead offering a discount on the purchase of a mobile phone or smartphone from a partner - a telecommunications operator.
Under current rules, banks can monitor information on corporate devices issued to their employees as they are used for business purposes with colleagues or clients.
The bank reserves the right to check mobile devices in extreme cases - for example, if an employee used it to conduct a meeting with a client that was not approved by Credit Suisse.
Now, after many employees have switched to remote work, the bank wants to extend this rule to all devices that have been used for work-related matters.
According to the newspaper, the bank's management has set a deadline by which employees can familiarize themselves with the new rule.
Credit Suisse has not officially commented on the new requirement.

Part 4
The last year of Sergei Yesenin’s life - 1925 - was fruitful in terms of creativity, but the most difficult for the poet’s earthly existence and his “ego”.
He is already outside of any literary associations, he has spat out imagism, he is on his own, but he is known, in demand, sometimes strongly scolded by critics, even spitefully, but the reading public is ready to carry him on their hands.
Over the course of the year, more than 60 poems were written, many of them true masterpieces, the cycle "Persian Motifs" was completed, the poem "Anna Snegina" was written, and 8 books were published, including the collection "Soviet Rus'".
And the main success was at the end of June 1925, when the State Publishing House signed a contract with Yesenin for the publication of his works in three volumes.
No contemporary of Sergey Alexandrovich has been so honored, he is the first!
Moreover, it promised very good money - according to the contract, the fee was 1000 rubles per month for 20 months (the factory director, for example, received 300 rubles per month, and an engineer - 200).
Funds were needed more than ever that year.
Yesenin married Leo Tolstoy's granddaughter, Sofia Tolstaya, and he needed to set up family life, support his sisters, Katya and Sasha, and his mother.
It seemed that life was getting back on track, there was something to be happy about, but for him everything was predominantly colored in dark tones, as if the nightmare from the poem "The Black Man" (written in November 1925 and published after Yesenin's death) had materialized:
My friend, my friend,
I'm very, very ill.
I don't know where this pain came from.
Either the wind is whistling
Over an empty and deserted field,
Is it like a forest in September,
Alcohol is a brain-destroyer.
Many acquaintances noted that Yesenin had lost a lot of weight, looked bad, and was clearly ill.
More and more often, there are binges, nervous breakdowns.
And the reason is probably not just alcoholism...
However, if such a diagnosis of alcoholism was made to Sergey Alexandrovich by someone, there are no reliable documents left.
For example, those from May 1923, when, at the insistence of his fourth wife, the American Isadora Duncan, Yesenin was recovering his health at a clinic near Paris under the care of Professor Petr Gannushkin (Yesenin will return to him two years later, already in Moscow).
But there are plenty of testimonies to the poet's drinking binges, scandals on this subject, and arrests - they are scattered across dozens of memoirs.
Since the early 20s, the poet's terrible romance with the green snake has been developing rapidly.
At the end of the summer of 1923, Yesenin stayed for a short time with a friend, the imagist Ivan Starcev.
Surprisingly, despite his not bad income, Yesenin never had his own home in Moscow or in St. Petersburg; he lived in rented apartments, in hotels, or with acquaintances.
Starzhevsky recalls:
"He only came to sleep, and in most cases in an insane, drunk state.
One time, returning at four in the morning, Yesenin fell on the landing...
Falling, I scratched my face and wheezed.
After coming to, he began coughing incessantly, spraying the entire bed with blood..."
And even Yesenin himself, after his trip to Europe and the United States (in the States there was a dry law at the time, but Duncan took a decent supply of alcohol with her), admitted:
"I didn't see anything there, except for pigs and streets...
I stopped remembering people towards the end...
Well, and he drank, of course...
And I drank because I was overcome with homesickness."

Promtex-Orient Duet Latex Econom mattress 100x195
Promtex-Orient Duet Latex Econom is a modern version of a budget model in the premium class line.
The mattress base is a block of independent double Duet springs.
A smaller, softer spring is inserted inside the large spring.
This allows for an even distribution of the load on the mattress.
The mattress is filled on both sides with a filler - artificial latex.
It is a substitute for natural latex, but it is denser and less expensive.
The flexibility and elasticity of this material increases the comfort effect of the mattress.
Synthetic latex is hypoallergenic, it does not absorb moisture and dust.
The mattress is perfect for a couple with a large weight difference (from 30 kilograms).
Thanks to the "smart" springs, there is no wave effect here, when a light partner slides to the side of a heavy one.
The pleasant, soft-to-the-touch Sense jacquard cover is lined with a layer of synthetic padding.
Natural fabrics do not hold static electricity.
It is possible to make this mattress model in a rolled-up version (vacuum roll-packing).
Now the son is almost 16, and he has long been free from the desire to misbehave.
All the energy is focused on choosing what he will do to make a living.
He's a lot more responsible than I was at his age or my husband, who had run-ins with the law from time to time up until his wedding.
The father is taking care of his young daughter.
And loves, as Lermontov wrote, "with a strange love".
Why did the girl cry during the exam, when she hadn't failed it yet?
Why didn't he tell his daughter that it wasn't school.
Well, it will have a tail.
So what?
He will retake it.
This is known to millions of students.
What is it all about, anyway?
Poland's foreign ministry says Belarus is using migrants as 'weapon' against EU
Poland’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes that Belarus is using migrants as a “weapon”
The Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of Poland, Paweł Jabłoński, expressed the opinion that the President of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko, used refugees as a “weapon” against the European Union and intends to return to such an “operation” next year.
The deputy head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs made the corresponding statement in an interview with the Australian Financial Review newspaper.
According to Yablonsky, the sanctions against Belarus have temporarily “stopped Lukashenko”, but he is “actively looking for new ways”.
The Polish official is also convinced that now illegal migrants will be used as a weapon "in many parts of the world."
As the kp.ru website wrote, earlier the European Union implemented the fifth package of sanctions against Belarus.
It affected 17 individuals and 11 organizations.
Europe has announced its readiness to further expand restrictive measures against the republic “if the situation in the country does not improve”.
In response, Minsk imposed a food embargo on a wide range of goods from countries that had previously decided to impose sanctions against Belarus.

"Not for Senya's cap": when a velvet jacket turns a man into a laughingstock
Velvet blazers dominated the 2021 social scene.
Perhaps the first to announce his new fashion choice was Daniel Craig.
Back in September, at the premiere of the film "No Time to Die", he appeared in a velvet raspberry jacket and the traditional "Bond" bow tie.
Following his lead, Prince William has twice broken the royal dress code, first wearing a green velvet jacket to the Earthshot Prize awards ceremony and then choosing a more classic option for an event in support of the Royal Variety charity.
A couple of weeks ago, Lionel Messi also tried on the trend.
The footballer came to collect his seventh "Golden Ball" in a velvet Dolce & Gabbana jacket.
By the way, his sons were dressed in the same.
AliExpress is already seeing growing demand for velvet men's jackets in Russia.
According to the service’s analysts, as reported to Gazeta.Ru, they began to be purchased 1.4 times more often.
The most popular are warm velvet jackets with a lining and a fitted silhouette, the main colours are dark beige, burgundy, dark blue and, of course, black.
The average price of such models is from 3 to 6 thousand rubles. At the same time, men prefer to buy only jackets - they choose velvet suit sets less often.
They can be purchased not only from online retailers.
Budget options are available at H&M, Mango, Next and Zara.
In the luxury segment, velvet blazers are being offered by almost all brands this season - including Brioni, Paul Smith, Etro and Saint Laurent.
The most sought-after model is considered to be the Gucci model, in which the brand ambassador Jared Leto appeared at one of the premieres of the film "House of Gucci".
When choosing jackets from expensive brands, you can be sure that the velvet is made from silk.
The special way the threads are woven together results in a dense fabric with a fluffy outer texture and a smooth inner side.
More budget-friendly options are made from cotton or polyamide, but they also last less.
Lamoda fashion expert Ilya Vakhoshkin warns that when it comes to a velvet blazer, the main thing is not its model or style, but its appropriateness.
"Velvet requires evening light, so such a jacket is ideal if you're going to a party or a formal event," explains Vakhoshkin. "It's also suitable for those occasions when the invitation specifies a "Black Tie" or "Creative Black Tie" dress code.
Another important criterion that allows one to make a choice in favor of a velvet jacket is the status of its buyer.
"A man in a velvet jacket, first and foremost, should get hold of the right advanced group of people with means," the authors of the Telegram channel about men's fashion "Beau Brummell" believe. "Owners of velvet jackets, as a rule, belong to the caste of those people who rarely buy tickets.
They are simply invited to the related social events, where the dress code is always specified.
Ilya Vakhoshkin suggests combining a velvet jacket with similar smart items: classic trousers with creases, solid-coloured shirts, silk ties, tasselled loafers, and cufflinks.
Too simple and everyday things will look out of place.
The fashion experts from "Beau Brummell" are sure that it would be inappropriate for an ordinary employee to appear in a velvet jacket at a corporate event, but if it is about "a leader among those who are in charge of this event, then - "yes", such a thing is suitable for him".
If the lower-ranking employee's goal is to move up in the company's complex hierarchy or to get financial bonuses, then it's better not to wear a velvet jacket.
Management will definitely appreciate the phrase "not a cap for Senya," the editors of the Telegram channel about men's fashion believe.
I have very mixed feelings about the voice.
It's an unnatural timbre, it's so strained.
And it has absolutely nothing to do with the sweet face of a young girl.
To be honest, I don't understand the admiration of those around me.
But I wish you all the best in life!
It's all about money - alternative energy is well lobbied, that is, paid for.
Billions of dollars of investment.
Are they sad?
No, the price of electricity has gone up.
Traditional energy is also not in the red - gas, oil, and coal were bought cheaper than they are being sold now.
There is a wild demand for fuel.
A penny drips.
And who is in the flight then?
As usual, he was just an ordinary customer.
Do the problems of the Indians touch the sheriff?
Therefore, one should not consider Western politicians idiots for "sleeping through" the energy crisis.
They did their job.
For a modest fee.
I didn't see any beautiful people in the photos in the article.
Just mediocrity in the context of average passengers.
Perhaps, if such characters are so sure of their beauty that they decide to show it to the whole carriage, then probably no one will sit next to them.
But only because of the mental disorder and ignorance of such "beauties", but not because of their appearance.
Kazbek, "a slave who is aware of his slave status and fights against it, is a revolutionary.
The slave who is unaware of his slavery and wallows in a silent, unconscious, and wordless life of a slave is simply a slave.
A slave who drools when he smugly describes the delights of a slave's life and gushes about his kind and good master is a lackey, a sycophant."
An immunologist stated that revaccination in 4-5 months will help protect against the "omicron" strain of the coronavirus
Revaccination four to five months later can protect against the new strain of the coronavirus infection "omicron".
This statement was made by immunologist Nikolay Kryuchkov, who called the six-month vaccination, taking into account the appearance of a new strain, "a very long period"
"With previous strains, such a period was normal, but now it is best to carry out the procedure after five months, and for people with chronic diseases - after four," the expert stated, calling for revaccination to be carried out in parallel with the vaccination campaign.
Kruchkov also noted that early revaccination provides a good titer of neutralizing antibodies.
“If a person has had two vaccinations and a booster, or has had the disease and been vaccinated, or has been vaccinated and had the disease, then they have ‘hybrid immunity’, that is, they have a lot of antibodies and enough neutralizing ones”, the expert clarified.
G7 warns Russia of 'severe consequences' in case of Ukraine invasion
The G7 countries (the United Kingdom, Germany, Italy, Canada, the United States, France, and Japan) have published a statement following the meeting of foreign ministers in Liverpool.
It emphasizes that "military aggression" by Russia against Ukraine "will have huge consequences and will be very expensive" for Moscow, but specific measures are not described in the document.
"We, the foreign ministers of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States of America, and the High Representative of the European Union, are united in our condemnation of Russia's military build-up and aggressive rhetoric towards Ukraine," the statement said.
Next, the ministers call on Russia to "de-escalate, use diplomatic channels, and respect its international commitments on military transparency," as US President Biden said during a video call with Russian President Putin on December 7.
"We confirm our support for the efforts of France and Germany in the Normandy format to achieve full implementation of the Minsk agreements in order to resolve the conflict in eastern Ukraine," the foreign ministers of the G7 also stated.
Any use of force to change borders is strictly prohibited by international law.
Russia should have no doubt that further military aggression against Ukraine will have massive consequences and severe costs," they warn.
We reaffirm our unwavering commitment to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, and the right of any sovereign state to determine its own future.
We welcome Ukraine's restrained position.
We will intensify our cooperation on our common and comprehensive response," the statement also said.
Earlier in the day, British Foreign Secretary Elizabeth Truss said that Russia would face "serious consequences" in the event of an invasion of Ukraine.
According to her, this meeting showed the "united voice of the G7 countries, which account for 50% of the world's GDP, and which have made it very clear that the invasion of Ukraine will have huge consequences for Russia".
Pfizer vaccine found to be 32 times less effective against Omicron variant
The effectiveness of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine against the omicron variant of the coronavirus is 32 times lower than against other types of the disease.
This conclusion was reached by scientists from the University of Hong Kong and the Chinese University of Hong Kong, according to South China Morning Post (SCMP).
The vaccine was found to be less effective based on a study of the antiviral activity of citizens who received two doses of the COVID-19 drug.
"We see that most people had a high level of antiviral activity against the original variant of Sars-CoV-2, however this ability was significantly reduced against the Omicron variant," Professor Malik Peiris explained.
At the same time, scientists emphasized that vaccination remains the most reliable way to protect against severe illness in the event of a coronavirus infection.
Earlier, scientists from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine predicted the development of the coronavirus pandemic, taking into account the impact of the omicron strain.
The authors of the study concluded that the Omicron variant could cause a new wave of virus circulation and an increase in mortality if additional measures are not taken.
The head of the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense accused Germany of blocking the delivery of NATO weapons to Kiev
The head of the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense, Aleksey Reznikov, accused the government of former German Chancellor Angela Merkel of blocking the purchase of lethal weapons by Kyiv within NATO.
In an interview with the Financial Times on December 12, Reznikov recalled that last month Germany vetoed the purchase of anti-sniper systems and rifles for shooting down drones by Ukraine.
It is noted that later Berlin softened its position on rifles, recognizing them as non-lethal weapons.
According to the defense minister, Kiev intends to acquire the above-mentioned weapons within the framework of bilateral agreements with allies.
In particular, this includes the United States, the United Kingdom, Lithuania, and France.
Meanwhile, the FT notes that the position of the new German government led by Chancellor Olaf Scholz on the issue of permission to supply weapons to Ukraine remains unclear.
Earlier on Sunday, the Ukrainian ambassador to Germany, Andriy Melnyk, expressed the opinion that Kyiv should not expect arms deliveries from Berlin under Chancellor Scholz.
According to him, the previous leadership of the Federal Republic of Germany explained its refusal to provide weapons by the risk of a military escalation of the conflict in Donbas, despite the "occupation of Russia" of part of Ukrainian territory.
The diplomat is convinced that Germany will maintain the same “illogical” position even with a new chancellor.
In August, Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky said that Kiev is awaiting assistance from Berlin in equipping the naval fleet.
Ukraine is counting on Germany to “be a partner of Ukraine in a technical sense”, the president added.
It was also noted that in the spring of this year, the co-chairman of the German Green Party, Robert Habeck, visited the republic, where he spoke in favor of selling defensive weapons to Kyiv.

G7 warns Russia of accountability for Ukraine invasion
Foreign ministers of G7 countries warned of "serious consequences" for Russia if it continues military aggression against Ukraine, according to the final statement of the parties.
The participants of the meeting also noted that they condemn the strengthening of Russian armed forces at the country's borders.
"Russia should have no doubt that further military aggression against Ukraine would have massive consequences and severe costs in response," the statement published on the UK government website said.
The G7 ministers and the EU High Representative noted that they are "united in their condemnation of Russian military build-up and aggressive rhetoric towards Ukraine."
British Foreign Secretary Elizabeth Truss warned of "serious consequences" for Russia in the event of an invasion of Ukraine at a press conference in Liverpool.
We have made it clear that any invasion will have massive consequences...
The G7 wants Russia to stop its aggression against Ukraine," she said (quoted by TASS).
Earlier, at the summit in Liverpool, G7 foreign ministers agreed that in order to resolve the crisis caused by the build-up of Russian troops on the border with Ukraine, the parties need to return to the negotiating table.
This was about negotiations in the "Normandy format".
The North Atlantic Alliance has also spoken out in favor of dialogue on Ukraine in the Normandy format.
Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said that by calling on Russia and Ukraine to return to the negotiating table, the G7 countries "signed a confession of their inability to take responsibility for their own mistakes."

Methods of returning money stolen through online stores revealed
There are several ways to get your money back from online stores and not become a victim of fraud in the future.
This was revealed by information security experts in a conversation with RBC.
For example, to reduce the risk of large losses in the event of a bank card falling into the hands of a criminal, it is recommended to keep the main funds on a card or bank account that is not used for online shopping.
Part of the savings can be put into a savings account and withdrawn as needed.
Experts also recommend getting a separate card for online purchases.
If the money was stolen during purchases in stores that do not use the 3D Secure security technology, you can initiate a refund procedure.
“In accordance with the rules established by payment systems for unauthorized transactions conducted without the use of 3D Secure, responsibility is placed on the participant in the payment chain who does not use this service”, clarified a representative of Promsvyazbank.
An expert from the international payment provider Ecommpay, Artur Zaremba, emphasized that the buyer has the right to submit an application to the bank to dispute a fraudulent operation no later than 120 days after the purchase.
In addition, if the criminal used the card on online resources that do not require two-factor authentication, the transaction can be disputed and the money returned.
It is noted that in some cases, online stores themselves will return the money to the customer if the order has not yet been sent for delivery.
On November 19, a member of the Public Chamber, director of the Safe Internet League, Ekaterina Mizulina, reported that in 2021 alone, 11,000 complaints were received about various cases of fraud: from the sale of fake documents to the theft of personal data.
According to her, an effective solution under the current circumstances may be the creation of a single window for complaints about online fraudsters.
Scholz arrived in Poland to discuss "Nord Stream 2" and EU legislation
Newly elected German Chancellor Olaf Scholz arrived in Warsaw for talks on the migrant crisis on the border with Belarus, the independence of the judiciary in Poland, the build-up of Russian troops near the borders of Ukraine and the situation with the Russian Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline.
Although Scholz has declared his desire to maintain good relations between Germany and Poland for many years to come, the leaders of the two countries have expressed unambiguous expectations of each other.
Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said he would call on Scholz to speak out against "Nord Stream 2," which is expected to deliver Russian gas to Germany bypassing Ukraine.
According to Morawiecki, Russia can use the gas pipeline against Europe as a means of political pressure.
In turn, Germany supported Poland's efforts to stop the flow of migrants trying to enter the country from Belarus.
Berlin has stated that it will help Warsaw and Brussels to resolve this crisis.
Poland's judicial system, however, remains one of the reasons for the dispute.
The European Court of Justice has fined Poland, ruling that judicial reforms carried out by the right-wing Law and Justice party violate EU law.
Poland refused to pay the fine and its highest court ruled that national law takes precedence over EU rules.
The new German government, sworn in on Wednesday, despite demands from Poland and the United States, has not made public commitments to stop the operation of "Nord Stream 2" in the event of a Russian invasion of Ukraine.
U.S. officials have told members of Congress that they have reached an understanding with Germany to halt the Nord Stream 2 pipeline if Russia invades Ukraine, a senior U.S. congressional aide said on Tuesday.
German officials have not confirmed the reports, but Scholz warned of consequences if Russia crossed Ukraine's border on Wednesday, and this position was confirmed by representatives of the G7 on Sunday.
Dmitry, pay more attention.
The view from the window is the same, and the size of the window has not changed.
The wall between the kitchen and the room was removed, so the second window is partially visible.
In general, those who are not familiar with the initial planning have doubts.
And I know such apartments very well and I can see very well how it was re-planned.
Let everything be well with them.
It always surprises me when they write about means to clean sinks, toilets, window sills, faucets.
You wash them once a year on Easter, or something like that, and you have to scrub them clean.
Just don't get dirty.
The Ministry of Digital Development wants to give writers residencies
The future Foundation for the Support of Russian Writers will receive federal property that was inherited from the Union of Writers of the USSR and the Literary Fund of the USSR.
Writer residencies will be created on its basis, the Ministry of Digital Development told Parlamentskaya Gazeta, which will become the founder of the fund.
The Ministry of Digital Development is preparing a draft presidential decree on the creation of a fund to support Russian writers.
The explanatory note clarifies that the fund will be tasked with caring for the targeted use and preservation of buildings and structures that once belonged to the Soviet Union of Writers and the Lithuanian Fund.
“A significant number of real estate objects that previously belonged to the Literary Fund of the USSR have been transferred to the ownership of the Russian Federation, including objects located in the Peredelkino writers’ village, the Komarovo settlement in the Leningrad region, and others”, the press service of the Ministry of Digital Development told Parlamentskaya Gazeta.
The draft decree stipulates that the charter of the Foundation should reflect that it is “established for the purpose of supporting literary activities by creating the necessary conditions for the creative work of writers”.
“By ‘creating conditions for creative activity’, it is meant to create writer’s residencies based on the transferred property in different regions of Russia, where there would be comfortable conditions for creativity”, the Ministry of Digital Development explained to our publication.

Doctors warn of danger of long-term use of blood thinners after COVID-19 and before vaccination
Doctors Irina Yartseva and Sergey Tokarev warned of the danger of uncontrolled use of blood thinners after contracting the COVID-19 coronavirus infection and before vaccination against the coronavirus.
The therapist and immunologist, Irina Yartseva, said that self-prevention of the possible formation of blood clots after COVID-19 can provoke a stroke.
Yartseva explained that blood thinners are not prescribed to everyone, only if the patient was hospitalized, was in the hospital, and had complications.
A doctor may prescribe anticoagulants (blood thinners that prevent excessive clot formation) as indicated.
She reported that there is currently a state of ignorance - everyone is taking anticoagulants for a long time and is experiencing complications in the form of hemorrhagic strokes (bleeding in the brain) as a result.
The chief health resort doctor of the Urals Federal District, the scientific director of the Society of Specialists in Preventive Medicine, Doctor of Medical Sciences Sergey Tokarev, told URA.RU in an interview that Russians are now often taking anticoagulants indiscriminately, even before vaccination against the coronavirus infection.
According to Dr. Tokarev, citizens believe dubious advice on the Internet and start self-medicating.
There are citizens who, a week before vaccination, on their own decision, start taking anticoagulants.
And at the preliminary examination before the vaccination, doctors notice the bruises.
He stressed that it is extremely dangerous to take any medication without determining the cause of any symptom.

The plumber who found money in the church wall will receive $20,000
The plumber who found the money in the wall of the church in the American state of Texas will receive a reward.
This is reported in a press release from the non-profit organization Crime Stoppers of Houston.
The incident took place at the large Lakewood evangelical church, where Pastor Joel Osteen preaches a message of wealth and prosperity for the faithful.
In November 2021, plumber Justin Cooley was repairing one of the church's toilets and found, under the insulation, thousands of packets of money and checks.
He turned the find over to the church and, according to him, did not even receive a thank you from Austin.
"I wanted to hear him say, 'You know, Justin, you did the right thing.
We understand what you did and what you could have done," KPRC-TV quoted him as saying.
The find appears to be related to a theft that occurred at the Lakewood church seven years ago.
At that time, about $200,000 in cash and $400,000 in checks, which were stored in the church safe, disappeared.
The money was insured, so the church did not suffer a loss.
However, a reward of $25,000 was announced for information about the criminals.
Justin Cooley was not eligible for the reward as the award had expired.
Despite this, the non-profit organization Crime Stoppers of Houston, which had previously offered a five thousand dollar reward and later received another twenty thousand dollars in a donation from Lakewood Church, decided to reward the plumber's honesty.
He will receive $20,000.
Earlier, it was reported that the police questioned pastor Joel Osteen about the money found in the wall of the Lakewood church.
Tanya, her statements, her actions - this is her characteristic "as a real person".
That is why the attitude towards her is so negative.
And it’s not because “she is financially much richer than all the writers”, as they write here.
There are people who are richer, but not all of them behave so brazenly, so provocatively, as this lady.

China records new case of human infection with bird flu virus
A new case of human infection with a highly pathogenic avian influenza virus H5N6 has been recorded in China.
This was reported by the RTHK radio station, citing a notification from the Hong Kong health authorities, TASS reports.
A 68-year-old resident of Huizhou, a city in the southern province of Guangdong, who kept poultry at home, was infected with the disease.
His condition is described by medics as critical.
The world's first human infection with the H5N6 virus strain was recorded in May 2014 in the southwestern province of Sichuan.
Since then, the number of such cases in the country has reached 53.
Brazil has made it mandatory for citizens to present vaccination passports when entering the country
In Brazil, they have made it mandatory to require COVID-19 passports from those entering the country. The corresponding decision was made by the Federal Supreme Court of Brazil (STF) judge Luis Roberto Barroso.
CNN Brasil reports this.
Citizens with contraindications to vaccination are exempt from presenting a vaccination certificate.
The list of exceptions also includes persons arriving from countries where the vaccine has been proven to be absent.
"The situation is even more serious when you consider that Brazil is a popular tourist destination for New Year's, pre-Carnival and Carnival parties, as well as other events, which suggests an increase in tourist traffic," Barrozo noted.
Earlier, the Brazilian authorities obliged tourists who were not vaccinated against the coronavirus to observe a five-day quarantine.
A scheme for full protection against COVID-19 has been revealed
The virologist, Doctor of Medical Sciences, Honored Scientist of Russia Anatoly Altstein, in conversation with Ura.ru, revealed the scheme for complete protection from the coronavirus infection.
According to him, this can be achieved by administering an injection and using a nasal vaccine.
When administered intranasally, a large amount of IgA is produced. This does not happen when the vaccine is injected.
IgA protects the mucous membrane, so the virus cannot get into the body.
And inside us, after vaccination, we produce the most immunoglobulin G (antibodies).
And if you get both vaccines, you will get a lot of IgA and IgG. But there is no decision yet on double vaccination," the medic said.
The chief health resort doctor for the Ural Federal District, Doctor of Medical Sciences Sergey Tokarev, in turn, stated that the main advantage of using nasal vaccination in conjunction with injectable vaccination is the ability to stop being a carrier of COVID-19.
He added that this would help as the body's defences should then be at their maximum.
Earlier, the Minister of Health of Nizhny Novgorod Region, David Melik-Guseynov, stated that the spread of the new coronavirus infection among children will lead to a new outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic.
According to him, this is exactly what is observed in other countries, where the next wave of the pandemic came earlier.
Inna, hmm...
I spoke to the male dog (he died a long time ago) like this - if you are ready to exchange a warm home, food, affection, love and games for a running bitch, then go ahead.
But the piglet was trained and was a smart guy in general.
I chose my company and went home.
The video shows a method that works in 90% of cases.
It's not made up, believe me.
I stopped many owners from running after the dog, although they said that 200,000 were running away (pomskies), I literally took them by the hand and led them in another direction.
In the end, the "200 thousand" chose the owner, and not the dog, which was running somewhere there.
Mass protests against vaccination continue in Europe
More than forty thousand demonstrators took to the streets in the Austrian capital of Vienna.
They expressed dissatisfaction with the restrictive measures and the authorities' plans to make vaccination against COVID-19 mandatory.
From February next year, unvaccinated people will have to pay a fine of 3600 euros.
Spaniards outraged by the government's health policy held a peaceful march in Madrid.
Some held signs reading "This is a fake pandemic," "I will not be vaccinated."
A large protest against sanitary passports took place in Barcelona, the capital of Catalonia.
In the autonomous community, the Covid certificate is mandatory for access to bars, restaurants, gyms, nursing homes and nightclubs.
The decision to introduce health passports was taken by the authorities of several regions of the country against the backdrop of an increase in the number of cases of coronavirus infection.
In Luxembourg, more than a thousand protesters demonstrated against the tightening of restrictions and QR codes.
The demonstration began peacefully but then escalated into clashes with security forces.
A group of protesters began throwing stones at the police.
In response, law enforcement officers used water cannons.
Nikolay S., even in Wikipedia there is no consensus on this matter.
Kashevarova-Rudneva is also referred to as the "first Russian doctor of medicine," probably because she began her studies earlier.
Let's just not argue, I think they both deserve the title.
The only thing I agree with Zakharova on is that the Americans only brought death and looting to any country they appeared in.

WHO has already detected "omicron" in sixty countries
The World Health Organization (WHO) has announced that the new coronavirus strain "omicron" has already been identified in 63 countries.
A number of experts are already saying that the spread of the new strain could have catastrophic consequences.
The WHO reported on the rate of spread of the strain.
According to the organization's data as of December 9, the strain has already been identified in 63 countries in all six WHO regions.
This is despite the fact that it has only started to spread actively since the end of November.
The WHO is also concerned about the rapid spread of the new coronavirus variant.
WHO experts express concern that the new strain, according to preliminary data, may be more widespread than the "delta" strain, also known as the Indian variant of the coronavirus, which is currently leading in absolutely all countries without exception.
Prior to this, the Director-General of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, stated that the omicron strain is capable of having a significant impact on the course of the coronavirus pandemic.
The UK has also come to a similar conclusion.
Experts from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) believe that "omicron" will displace "delta" in the coming months.
And the number of people infected in Britain alone will be about 1 million. This is despite the fact that officially "omicron" is currently infecting several hundred people in the Kingdom, and according to estimates, up to 10 thousand.
British experts predict tens of thousands of deaths from the "omicron" strain, and at the peak more than 2 thousand people will be taken to hospitals daily.
Something that the British healthcare system will not be able to cope with.
The situation is complicated by the fact that according to the latest research, the effectiveness of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine against the "omicron" strain is 32 times lower in comparison with other types of the disease.
It is not yet known how the Russian Sputnik V vaccine will react to “omicron” – this will become clear in the next few weeks.
The Gamaleya Center has just started testing the Russian vaccine on the “omicron” strain.
Why do we need to see the stages of aging?
It would be better to see your exercises in more detail.
It is unclear how to do the first exercise: sitting on your heels or standing on your knees, as written, but then how to press your hands on your hips?

Curious Squirrel, you are right, communication on the Internet is completely different, it is easy and natural to communicate, but when you meet in person, there is nothing to say.
And seeing a person in person may not be what you expected, it didn't hit you - and that's where the attitude comes from.
When they meet their person, then their views will change.
And once again, the Soviet period is being called "the time of the devil."
Then people believed in God much more honestly than they do today.
And they were raised practically according to God's laws (love your neighbor, don't steal, etc.).
What is the ideology today? Money at any cost.
Gossip like Globa has little faith (and she has none at all), but even if so, the time of the devil came in the 90s...
Our St. Petersburg, more precisely Leningrad, communal apartment on Bolshaya Zelenina is still in touch.
Of course, we are not the closest of friends, but we try to maintain the warmth of the relationship between the older generation.
Perhaps this is due to the fact that there were no visitors in the apartment, the rooms were not rented out, and the blockade brotherhood was not cancelled.
Unfortunately, we see each other more often at funerals.
Lara Angelskaya, come on!
Human babies, especially males, are strong, active, energetic, romp, push, wrestle, fight, just like their little "cousins" in the wild!
It's a shame that they're not as soft as puppies or kittens, so bruises, bumps, and scratches are common, and it's no boomerang!
And why should they?
Did the brother push him, not calculating his strength?
And you've always been so nimble that you've never accidentally hurt anyone or injured yourself?

Seven people have died in Brazil as a result of the rains
At least seven people died and 175 were injured as a result of heavy rains that fell on the northeastern Brazilian state of Bahia and neighboring Minas Gerais.
This is reported by TASS, citing emergency services.
An extratropical cyclone has been raging at the border of these states since the middle of the week, and as a result, the amount of precipitation in the region has reached 450 mm. A state of emergency has been declared in 25 municipalities of the state of Bahia, and in some of them, the floods have been the most destructive in 35 years.
Several bridges, two river dams, and three roads have been destroyed by the elements.
According to the emergency services, about 5,700 people were left without a roof over their heads, and another 6,700 were forced to leave their homes.
The damage caused by the natural disaster affected more than 85,000 residents of the region.

$135 billion went into apps - Hi-Tech
In 2021, user spending in apps grew by 25% worldwide, and the number of downloads - by 8%.
The most popular services in the world turned out to be various video services.
The most downloaded app was the video editor CapCut, and the most money was spent on YouTube.
Both the number of app downloads and user spending in them showed significant growth during the period from January to November 2021.
The number of downloads increased by 8%, reaching 140 billion. User spending in apps increased even more significantly: by 25%, to a record $135 billion.
Such data was published by the analytics company App Annie, which presented a report on the mobile app market in 2021.
In 2021, the global economy emerged from the lockdown and began the post-pandemic recovery.
"Will such a "return to the physical" slow the growth of the app economy? Not at all," the report's authors believe.
India is the leader in the number of app downloads: it accounts for about 20% of all downloads.
The United States (9%) and Brazil (8%) follow.
As before, iOS gadget users spent more than Android users: iOS accounted for 65% of all in-app spending.
Among applications, the video editor CapCut took first place in the number of downloads in 2021.
It is followed by two Indian apps - video service MX TakaTak and online shopping app Meesho.
Telegram is also in the top 10 for the number of downloads.
Overall, if we judge by the number of downloads, VPN services (two of which are in the top 10 - VPN Master and NightOwl VPN) and services related to creating and broadcasting videos (in addition to CapCut and MX TakaTak, two more such services are in the top 10 - Moj and SnackVideo) are popular among users.
"Users spent the most in live-streaming and online streaming apps," the report's authors note.
YouTube is in the lead here, and the top 5 in terms of user spending also includes the video service TikTok, the streaming video services Disney+ and HBO Max, and the Japanese manga subscription service Piccoma.
The first places in terms of the number of monthly active users are occupied by Telegram, Instagram, Zoom and TikTok, with the mobile version of Microsoft Office rounding out the top five.
In Russia, the shopping app AliExpress was the leader in the number of downloads for the year.
It is followed by the Zenly service, which shows the location of friends, and the same CapCut.
Also in the top 10 apps are: online karaoke StarMaker, online clothing retailer Shein, Maps for Minecraft PE app, online taxi ordering service DiDi, Pure Tuber YouTube client, Dixy retailer app and Samokat online store.
People around the world have adapted to the pandemic by moving to a mobile life, which can be called one of the main conclusions.
The most successful industries were those that helped people to be closer to each other, both virtually and in person," commented App Annie's Head of Marketing Insights, Lexi Sydow, on the results of the report.
The mobile gaming sector's revenue in 2021 reached $90 billion. The leaders in terms of the number of downloads were casual and hyper-casual games, in which there is no or almost no plot, and the video design is minimal.
Count Masters, Project Makeover and Bridge Race made it into the top 3 most popular games in the world.
In Russia, the leading games are DOP 2: Delete One Part, Going Balls and Phone Case DIY.
Earlier, App Annie presented its forecast for 2022.
Among the main trends for the next year, the company's analysts named the growth in the number of TikTok users to 1.5 billion, the growth in popularity among Generation Z of financial applications, for example, the Robinhood investor application, as well as the further increase in the popularity of metaverse mobile games.

Russians warned of new scam scheme
The perpetrators have begun to look for new tricks for fraud in video messages.
Izvestia writes about this, citing experts.
According to Ivideon's Director of Products, Zaur Abutalimov, the main danger associated with the spread of video communication tools is deepfakes.
In this case, the fraudsters create a fake video based on real recordings involving the victim.
This allows the neural network to accurately reproduce the features of the behavior of a particular person.
Abutalimov added that using deepfake, criminals can call the victim's acquaintances via video call or create a video with a copy of a person for distribution with the aim of blackmail.
"Such fakes can easily provoke bullying, since a well-informed perpetrator can place people in ridiculous, dangerous or compromising pseudo-scenarios," the expert said.
Varonis' lead systems engineer Alexander Vetkol, in turn, noted that people psychologically trust others more when they see them.
He stressed that this could create specific risks in the case of technologies using video.
David, I'll add.
In what I wrote above, I emphasized that I bought all of this in a small town, where the local mentality did not allow for heavy makeup and wearing short skirts, showing off stockings and tights on your legs.
It's a province, but the store USED to have such an item.
In big cities, Muslim women also wore makeup and showed their thighs.
And it's the same in Dushanbe, it's a big city, the capital of the republic.
There are many fashionistas, but there is no same cosmetics.
Five actions to help avoid diabetes have been listed
Problems with blood sugar levels are some of the most common in the world.
However, some people don't pay much attention to this, and that's a mistake.
Diabetes can lead to serious complications and even death over time.
Prophylactic measures play the main role in preventing the formation of diseases.
For example, doctors recommend changing the drinking regime - reducing the amount of various drinks and switching to plain water has a positive effect on metabolism.
Sweet foods raise blood sugar levels to dangerous levels when consumed in excess.
Therefore, the first step towards a healthy lifestyle is to stop buying sweets and keeping them at home.
The appearance of the disease is not only affected by improper nutrition, but also by habits.
To reduce the risk of diabetes, you need to move a lot.
Experts advise following a low-carb diet.
Such a diet will not only help to lose weight, but will also protect against sharp fluctuations in blood sugar levels.
To protect against the disease of diabetes, it is necessary to eat a lot of fiber.
Dietary fibre fills the stomach and thus promotes the feeling of satiety, the release of digestive juices and the absorption of food.

Dr. Pavlov spoke about "weekend migraine" in workaholics
Several factors can lead to a deterioration in health over the weekend
The reason for the deterioration of health after working days is often "weekend migraine", explained the well-known endocrinologist, candidate of medical sciences, senior researcher at the Faculty of Fundamental Medicine of Moscow State University, scientific director of the Systemic Medicine Clinic, Zuhra Pavlova in her Telegram channel.
According to her, workaholics are especially prone to this, who experience headaches, fatigue and weakness on weekends.
Dr. Pavlov noted that in addition to the fatigue accumulated over the week, there are many objective reasons for the body's negative reaction to a change in conditions.
On the weekend, our lives change completely.
"We sleep for a long time, lie on the couch all day, probably eat more, and drink less," the doctor argued. "Because of the lack of coffee, a slight withdrawal begins.
Overeating and lack of water - heaviness and fatigue".
The late rise plays an additional role.
For example, if you get up three hours later than usual, you will experience a reaction that is called jet lag.
It occurs in travelers who cross multiple time zones.
To determine which of the factors is playing a decisive role in the deterioration of her well-being, Pavlova recommended tracking what changes the most on the weekends.

South African scientists say Pfizer vaccine is not very effective against 'Omicron'
South Africa reports low effectiveness of Pfizer vaccine against "Omicron"
South African scientists have conducted a study and reported on the low effectiveness of the Pfizer vaccine against the omicron strain of the coronavirus infection.
It is estimated that (the level of "Omicron" neutralization) corresponds to (the level of) vaccine effectiveness at 22.5% against symptomatic infection, which... casts doubt on the vaccine's ability to protect against infection, the study text published on the MedRxiv portal states.
At the same time, experts clarified that the drug can save from a severe course of the disease.
Earlier, the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine predicted that the omicron variant of the coronavirus could cause a new wave of the pandemic in the UK with more hospitalizations than a year ago.
How much hidden sugar is in common foods?
Sugar is not the best source of beneficial nutrients.
Its excess in the diet can lead to type 2 diabetes, as well as cause cardiovascular and cancer diseases.
Consumers should be aware that an unfamiliar word in a product's ingredients list may be a hidden sugar - an ingredient similar to sugar in terms of calories, composition and glycemic index.
The label may list dozens of names, essentially meaning sugar.
Some of the most common and frequently encountered names are glucose and fructose.
There may also be other sugars that have been extracted, such as dextrose (sugar from corn), levulose (fruit sugar), molasses (black treacle), agave syrup, etc.
These are all simple carbohydrates that fall into the category of monosaccharides and disaccharides, and they can be found not only in sweets, but also in ketchup, in hot dogs, in bread, and so on.
According to Rospotrebnazor, the most effective way to reduce sugar consumption is to eat whole and unprocessed foods, and to pay attention to the label and the many different names for sugar.
Different types of sugar vary in taste, but no matter what the ingredient is called in a product's ingredients list - syrup or nectar, processed or unprocessed, brown or white - it's still sugar.
It's not easy to calculate the exact amount of sugar, as you need to take into account not only the amount of sugar indicated by the manufacturer on the package, but also the fact that vegetables, fruits, etc. originally contain a certain amount of sugar.
Therefore, the total amount of sugar can be significantly higher than stated on the label.
German Chancellor Scholz: Gas will lose importance for Germany in 25 years
New German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said that gas imports are losing importance for Germany as the country continues its transition to a decarbonized economy.
According to him, Germany plans to completely abandon gas, oil and coal by 2045, becoming a climate-neutral country.
"That is to say, in 25 years, the world will be such that the issue of transporting gas to Germany and Europe will play a different role," said the chancellor.
Scholz noted that Germany continues to be committed to the fact that Ukraine will transport Russian natural gas in the future as well, as this resource is currently important for the energy transition.
He recalled that Germany and the United States made a statement in which Berlin's support for Ukraine's energy transformation was recorded.
Earlier, German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock stated that the certification process for the Nord Stream 2 pipeline is ongoing.
According to the minister, it was stated during the coalition negotiations and the discussion of the coalition agreement that European energy law should be applied to energy projects.
The diplomat also pointed out that the pipeline "does not meet the requirements" of the European Union.

Hackers break into Twitter account of Indian PM
Hackers have broken into the Twitter account of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
The perpetrators managed to publish a fake message.
It was reported that India had allegedly recognized bitcoin as a legal means of payment, as well as that the country had already purchased cryptocurrency.
Modi's office asked for the new messages to be ignored.
Representatives of the prime minister said that Twitter responded quickly - access to the account was restored.
The Prime Minister's page was hacked in 2020 and the hackers called for donations to a fund using cryptocurrency.
In the referendum in New Caledonia, the majority voted against independence
The third referendum in New Caledonia, held on 12 December, ended with the same result as the two previous ones.
According to the first partial results announced on Sunday, December 12 at noon, most of the residents of New Caledonia voted during the referendum against the independence of their territory.
At the same time, the level of participation in this third vote was significantly lower than in the previous two.
According to preliminary results published by local authorities, 3.51% (2,755 people) voted in favor of New Caledonia's independence from France, while 96.49% (75,762) voted "against".
The turnout was 43.90%, with more than 80,000 residents of New Caledonia taking part in the election.
As the France-Presse agency commented on these interim results, "the outcome of these elections left no room for doubt," as the independence supporters called on voters not to participate in the vote.
As the initiators of the referendum, they have spoken out against holding it on 12 December, considering that the new outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic on the archipelago is preventing a full and "honest" election campaign.
Thus, this abstention opened the way to a third victory for the supporters of French New Caledonia, after the referendums held in November 2018 and in October 2020.
In 2018, 56.7% of residents voted against independence, in 2020 - 53.3%.
The separatists say they do not recognize the results of the latest vote and will challenge them at the United Nations.
As reported on Sunday, December 12, at the Elysee Palace, French President Emmanuel Macron is due to speak on the results of this referendum.
The issue of New Caledonia's independence has dominated the final weeks of the French presidential campaign.
Several presidential candidates have spoken in favor of the territory remaining part of France, as it is "the last European Union presence in the Pacific."
"New Caledonia must remain French at all costs," Eric Zemmour repeated.
The same statement was made by the Republican candidate, Valerie Pecresse, who published a column in Le Figaro at the end of October, calling on the Caledonians to remain French.
For his part, Emmanuel Macron announced in May 2018 that he would not take a position "because it is not his responsibility".
However, the president added: "France would be less beautiful without New Caledonia."
Prime Minister Jean Castex, for his part, expressed a "strong desire for the choice of the Caledonians to be the choice of France".

Turkey tested the world's first drone with a laser weapon
The first drone with laser weapons in the world was successfully tested in Turkey.
The Eren UAV was tested at a distance of 100 to 500 meters, reports MIR24.
The device is capable of neutralising explosive objects at a distance using a laser.
The maximum flight height of the new model reaches 3,000 m.
After passing the necessary tests, the drone will be put into service with the Turkish military, which will use it to destroy explosive devices without the involvement of sappers.
The agency emphasizes that Turkey is among the six countries in the world capable of developing and producing its own drones.

WSJ readers criticize article on Russia-U.S. ties
Readers of The Wall Street Journal have criticized an article by Professor Christopher Hartwell, in which he described his vision of relations between Russia and the United States.
The author of the material expressed concern that the West is allegedly sacrificing Ukraine to Russia.
In his article, he convinced readers of the danger emanating from Moscow and made a number of insulting remarks about Russian President Vladimir Putin.
At the end, Hartwell called on Western countries to "stand as one against Russia."
Readers of the WSJ expressed their disagreement with the American professor's position.
“There is a lot of false information in this article”, RIA Novosti quotes one of the readers as saying.
"Europe is not ours to "lose," and Ukraine is not our land.
The United States and NATO allies will never go to nuclear war with Russia over Ukraine," another noted.

A 5.2 magnitude earthquake occurred in the Kuril Islands region
A 5.2 magnitude earthquake occurred near the Kuril island of Shikotan.
It is noted that the epicenter of the earthquake was located 231.8 km northeast of the city of Severo-Kurilsk.
The epicenter was at a depth of 92.5 km.
Earlier, seismologists recorded a 7.5 magnitude earthquake in Peru, during which ten people were injured.

Ukraine will begin to produce new generation jet drones
A new Ukrainian-Turkish plant will start to create jet unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) of the ANKA type.
This was reported by the freelance adviser to the head of the Ukrainian president's office, Aleksey Arestovich, on December 11.
That is, they are capable of acting against air objects, against other drones.
Even against manned aircraft.
They will have Ukrainian engines and the rest of the Turkish avionics: the fuselage and so on," Dialog.ua quotes him as saying.
Commenting on the main features of the ANKA drones, Arestovich said that they are jet-powered, not piston-powered drones.
According to him, this is a new generation of drones after the Bayraktar, which exceeds it "in all characteristics".
The first batch of drones should be produced by the factory at the end of next year, concluded Arestovich.
The ANKA aircraft was created by the Turkish Space Agency in February 2014.
The development of the drone was carried out by the Turkish authorities in cooperation with a number of private companies since 2010.
The day before, the Ukrainian General Staff classified information on the use of Bayraktar drones and Javelin missile systems during military operations of the joint forces in Donbass.
On December 6, the President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky, announced that the construction of a plant for the manufacture of modern military drones had begun in the country.
According to him, Ukraine is determined to use drones.
On September 29, the Bayraktar Savunma company and the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense signed an agreement on the construction of a center in the Kyiv region, where personnel will be trained, as well as tests and maintenance of the Turkish Bayraktar UAVs.
The press service of the Ukrainian leader's office called this memorandum "a big real step forward".
Two lions escaped from a container at the airport
Lions have escaped at Singapore's Changi Airport.
The Straits Times reports this.
Two predators managed to escape from a container with seven lions, which arrived on one of the planes.
The publication notes that it remains unknown from which country they were brought to Singapore, and where they were headed.
One of the escaped lions lay down on the roof of a container.
The animals could not move away from it because of the protective net installed nearby.
The standoff ended after the arrival at the airport of staff from the Mandai Wildlife Group, which oversees all of Singapore's zoos.
They immobilized the lions with tranquilizer darts and plan to transport them to a quarantine facility.
Earlier, it was reported that in Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia, a lion escaped from its owner and wandered the streets of the city.
On the same day, the animal voluntarily returned home, and no people were hurt.
Experts warn of cancer risk from B9 vitamin
Research suggests that an excess of vitamin B9, also known as folic acid, can lead to cancer.
The Daily Express warned about this.
According to experts, there is strong evidence that people who do not have a deficiency of folic acid are less likely to get some types of cancer, in particular colorectal cancer.
However, exceeding the necessary dose, on the contrary, promotes the growth of cancer cells.
Professor Beth Kitchin, a dietitian at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, advises to keep track of the amount of folic acid consumed throughout the day.
The optimal dose is 400 micrograms per day.
The risk of cancer only increases if you deviate significantly from this number in either direction.
Kitchin recommends not to take B9 in pill form without a doctor's recommendation, to always monitor the dosage and to avoid cereals with milk and other food products that contain folic acid.
Earlier, nutritionist Rachel Fine called folic acid a substance that slows down aging.
Since it is found, among other things, in avocados, Fine recommended that men over 50 eat the fruit more often.
In the UK, up to 75,000 people could die due to the omicron strain by April
British scientists' forecasts show that up to 75,000 people could die in England in the next five months due to the spread of the omicron strain of the coronavirus if winter restrictions are not tightened.
The Guardian newspaper reported this, citing a study by experts from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), TASS reports.
According to the most optimistic forecast of experts who are members of the UK government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, by April 2022, the country will record no fewer than 25,000 fatalities due to the omicron strain, and a total of about 175,000 patients will be hospitalized.
At the peak of the outbreak, hospitals will be treating more than 2,000 infected people a day.
"Serious measures to control COVID-19 may be needed to prevent the NHS from being overwhelmed if the Omicron variant is more transmissible than the Delta variant and current vaccines do not prevent infections," said mathematician Rosanna Barnard from LSHTM.
Earlier, the UK Health Security Agency reported that if the rate of spread of the omicron strain remains at its current level, then by the end of the year, about 1 million cases of infection will be detected in the country.
At the same time, by mid-December, the omicron strain may become dominant in the United Kingdom.
As of now, 1,898 cases of the omicron variant of the coronavirus have been detected in the United Kingdom, of which 633 were identified in the last 24 hours.
At the same time, on December 9, the head of the British Ministry of Health, Sajid Javid, indicated that in reality this figure could already be reaching 10,000 cases.
I wanted to write some kind of smart comment, but I read up to this point:

Demand for superyachts has grown by a quarter worldwide
Superyacht construction this year and orders for next year are breaking all records worldwide, despite calls to reduce the carbon footprint and fight climate change.
The number of ordered yachts in the world ship register is 1200 units - a quarter more than last year.
In the era of climate change adaptation, it is hard to imagine that the number of people who have the desire and the money for a £50m-plus floating fortress will not decline, The Guardian writes.
But there are more and more of them.
This year, 25% more ships were ordered than in the previous year.
Brokers say they haven't seen such a frenzy in the market in 20 years.
The first reason is that many who can afford a yacht are fearful of contracting the virus on land and prefer to hide from the pandemic on board their own vessel.
The second reason is also related to the coronavirus.
If before all these people went to the office and met with business partners in person, now the absolute majority of them work remotely and conduct negotiations via Zoom.
Broker Will Christie told the newspaper that shipyards are taking orders for new yachts for 2025 and beyond.
This means that clients are willing to pay more just to have their yacht ready at least a year or two earlier.
"People just want freedom and the super-rich could afford it," he says.
In the Western world, many criticize such behavior by the rich and call it decadent.
The rich, say sociologists, do not want to understand that in times of deprivation, travel to space, life on yachts or flights on their own planes cause irritation in society, because the elite does not want to share the responsibility for climate change with the rest of humanity.
Economists are calling on governments to act and are proposing new taxes and rules for the super-rich, although they acknowledge that with money so mobile, it will be extremely difficult to achieve.
Meanwhile, it is only the number of ordered super-yachts that is impressive, but also their characteristics.
Of the 1,200 ships, 27 have a stern length of more than 100 meters.
Norwegian billionaire Rekke is building the 183-meter yacht REV Ocean.
After its launch, it will be the largest yacht in the world.
The yacht is equipped with a "moon pool," as well as a submarine designed to explore the depths of the sea.
Helipads, open-air cinemas and, on some, such as the yacht of fighter McGregor, a combat platform have become common on existing super-yachts. Professor of Economic Anthropology at Indiana University, Richard Wilk, says that compared to the total amount of greenhouse gas emissions, the carbon footprint produced by the super-rich is negligible.
But it has symbolic meaning, considering that there are just over 2000 multibillionaires in the world.
It's just another example of over-consumption by a very small group of people.
Scientists have found that the carbon footprint of billionaires is thousands of times greater than that of the average inhabitant of the planet.
If one person produces an average of 5 tonnes of CO2 per year, the planet's biggest polluter, Roman Abramovich, is responsible for 33.9 tonnes of greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere in 2018.
At the same time, two-thirds of the emission trail was attributed to his 162.5-meter yacht Eclipse.
Even if the owner is not on board the yacht, the crew continues to pollute the planet.
The owner can call the captain and ask him to bring the yacht, for example, from the Mediterranean to the Caribbean.
Superyacht owners don't get much sympathy from others when they, like Australia's richest woman Gina Rinehart, who owns mines on the continent, complain via YouTube that there is no room for their giant vessels to dock.
It is also difficult to understand her call to build marinas for ships with a length of 50 meters.
Dangerous weekly alcohol dose linked to bowel cancer risk
American scientists have determined the amount of alcoholic beverages per week that increases the risk of developing cancer.
This is reported by the Daily Express.
Experts have concluded that the consumption of four or more servings of alcoholic beverages per week is associated with an increased risk of developing cancer.
At the same time, the likelihood of developing the disease increases with the amount of alcohol consumed.
In fact, men who drink moderately have a higher risk of developing bowel cancer than women.
Scientists cannot determine the exact cause of the development of this type of cancer, noting only that certain factors lead to a harmful process for the body.

Dogs can understand words and phrases at the level of a two-year-old child
Many, and more precisely all dog lovers, are sure that these creatures are very smart.
But even they have no idea how sophisticated these four-legged pets really are.
For many years, biologists have conducted various experiments to determine for sure how developed the intelligence of animals is.
Although a dog's vocabulary is not as extensive as a human's, new research proves that a dog can consistently respond to 89 words or phrases.
The scientists' work was published in Sciencealert.
Dogs can't play chess or write poetry, they don't understand politics, economics or art, yet they often manage to fool their owners.
Some breeds, experts say, show the best results in understanding human language words, but there is not enough statistical data for accurate conclusions.
For example, some breeds are traditionally considered canine geniuses - for example, Labradors.
Scientists have concluded that dogs are capable of logical thinking and are as capable of learning as a two-year-old child.

Ukraine is ready for the trade-off between the United States and Russia
The United States and Russia will “bargain” over Ukraine’s accession to NATO, analyst Alexander Kochetkov stated in his article for the Glavred publication.
In his opinion, Washington and Moscow plan to continue negotiations in the near future on the guarantees of the United States regarding the fact that Ukraine will not join the North Atlantic Alliance, despite the words of the American leader Joe Biden about the right of countries "to join anywhere".
If you are offered something that is obviously unacceptable, for example, to sell a close relative into sexual slavery, you would not haggle, but simply send the person making the offer away.
And as for Ukraine, a bargain is in the offing," the analyst wrote.
Kochetkov added that Russia does not plan to attack Ukraine, but is seeking dialogue with Kyiv.
"They conduct their preparations in secret, quickly, and immediately move to offensive action, and do not wait until the grouping is detected and counteraction forces are deployed," he noted.
China Stimulates the Development of the Railway Transportation Industry
Advanced Chinese technologies have attracted the attention of companies from the United States, Germany, France and other countries at the 2021 China International Rail Transit and Equipment Manufacturing Exhibition held in Zhuzhou City, Hunan Province/Central China/.
The core technologies developed by CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co. Ltd. allow trains to automatically detect and diagnose technical faults, noted the company's representative Hou Zhaowen.
The high-speed trains running on the China-Laos railway, which was put into operation at the beginning of this month, are already equipped with these technologies, which will ensure increased reliability and operability of the rolling stock.
In the past six months, China has significantly increased the export of railway vehicles, and many countries in Asia and Europe are witnessing the "Chinese speed".
In May of this year, the first two-storey high-speed electric trains developed in China rolled off the production line of CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co., Ltd. and were intended for export to Europe.
With a maximum working speed of 200 kilometers per hour, these trains will run on the railways of Austria, Germany, Hungary and other European countries.
In November, the trial operation of a metro train developed by the above-mentioned company for Turkey began.
The train will run on the metro line connecting the center of Istanbul with the city's airport.
The metro line will open next year.
This will be the fastest metro line in Turkey with a speed of 120 kilometers per hour.
"The Chinese railway equipment manufacturing industry is one of the most innovative industries with the strongest international innovation competitiveness," said Feng Yaoshan, head of the Trade and Investment Department of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade (CCPIT).
"This industry is the main competitive advantage of Chinese high-end equipment manufacturing in the global market," said Feng Yaoshan.
After more than 60 years of hard work, China has created an advanced railway equipment manufacturing system with a full range of supporting facilities and large-scale production activities through a series of independent research and development.
According to Feng Yaoshan, the country ranks first in the level of electrification of railways and in the operational mileage of high-speed and urban railways.
A biologist listed the early signs of dementia
Candidate of biological sciences, Semyon Golosheykin, in a conversation with Sputnik radio, listed the early signs of dementia.
According to him, signs of future dementia may include forgetfulness, as well as a whole range of mild cognitive impairments, such as an inability to concentrate, plan, and reduced levels of abstract thinking.
There is currently a debate about whether hearing loss can be both an early sign of Alzheimer's disease and a risk factor for it, the expert said.
Golosheykin emphasized that the causes of dementia can be neurodegenerative disorders, head injuries, some infections, metabolic disorders, and a lack of certain vitamins.
He added that Alzheimer's disease and atherosclerosis of the brain vessels are the most common causes of this syndrome.
The biologist noted that to date, doctors do not know of any effective treatments for dementia.
Therefore, it is necessary to start its prevention in a timely manner.
According to him, studying foreign languages and active communication will help reduce the risk of developing dementia.
WHO also recommends maintaining a moderate level of physical activity, regularly exercising cognitive skills through games and hobbies that require intense engagement of memory and logical thinking
"There are recommendations for the use of various dietary supplements, however, their effectiveness and expediency are still being discussed in the scientific community," Golosheykin said.
"The World Health Organization recommends maintaining a moderate level of physical activity, regular training of cognitive skills and abilities with the help of games and hobbies that require intensive involvement of memory and logical thinking," said Golosheykin.
Earlier, a UK charity for dementia research said the disease was increasingly affecting people in their 40s.
Doctors have named the early symptoms of Alzheimer's disease.
The first warning sign can be considered problems with vision, due to which the patient acquires difficulties in recognizing objects.
Another sign of developing dementia experts named aphasia - a condition when a person cannot find the right words to convey what they want to say.
The neurologist demanded that Saakashvili be sent abroad for treatment
Former President of Georgia Mikheil Saakashvili needs psychoneurological treatment and rehabilitation abroad, neurologist Otar Toidze, who is part of a group of doctors created by the Ombudsman of Georgia, told journalists.
His [Saakashvili's] neurological status is the leading factor in his illness.
The stable problems are problems with movement, coordination, and mood swings," the specialist said, noting that this is not beyond the norm and the former president now needs to be sent for special rehabilitation.
"We call this neurorehabilitation and psychoneurological rehabilitation, the possibility of which we did not find in Georgia," Toidze noted, demanding that Saakashvili be treated in a special institution, which does not exist in Georgia.
On the evening of December 7, Saakashvili began to sabotage his receipt of medical care after the penitentiary service staff subjected him to disciplinary punishment.
The Georgian politician quickly managed to have the punishment overturned and to restore his previous rights.

Or are we so holy that we eat pranic food?

These people are parasites on the body of society.
They don't work, don't pay taxes, live on benefits and at the expense of their relatives.
At the same time, they receive full medical care.
How many mouths can a job feed?
We feed all the alcoholics, drug addicts, who have also lost their health due to their own stupidity.
Then we wonder about the extension of the retirement age.
These sums could be spent on treating genuinely ill people.

Protests against COVID passports held in Spain
In the Spanish cities of Barcelona and Valencia, protests were held against the mandatory COVID-19 vaccination certificate, reports the Europa Press agency.
In the Catalan capital, the number of participants in the action was approximately 3,000 people.
In Barcelona, COVID passports have become mandatory for going to bars, restaurants, gyms, nursing homes and nightclubs.
Many of the protesters came to the rally without masks.
With slogans on their posters, they accused the state of totalitarianism and called for respect for the choice of citizens.
In Valencia, vaccination passports will also be required to enter entertainment venues and restaurants with a capacity of more than 50 people.
Protesters in this city have declared a medical dictatorship and called the vaccination an experiment.
Since the start of the pandemic, more than 5.2 million cases of coronavirus infection have been identified in Spain, and more than 88,000 patients have died.
Russia is also planning to introduce restrictions for the unvaccinated.
The government introduced bills on a unified QR code system into the State Duma on 12 November.
It is expected that Russians will be able to visit mass events, cultural institutions, food and retail outlets by presenting either a vaccination or recovery certificate, or a medical exemption from vaccination.
The same rules will apply to travel by train and plane.

A steep climb: How Chinese are becoming skiers
The Olympics should attract millions of people to the slopes and help create international-level resorts in the country
In China, it is hoped that the Olympics will not only attract 300 million citizens to participate in winter sports, which will allow the collection of the 1 trillion yuan indicated by President Xi Jinping, but will also promote the economic development of backward remote provinces.
The Taiwu ski resort in Zhangjiakou, located near the site of the Winter Olympics, is becoming increasingly popular with Chinese people.
In addition to the construction of infrastructure in the region, work is also being carried out to green the area: workers are planting trees.
The country has more than 700 ski resorts, but only 20 of them are large enough to host international-level competitions.
In many regions of China where the resorts are located, including Zhangjiajie, there are problems with snow.
The main long-term goal is to ensure a comfortable and interesting vacation at Chinese resorts, so that all newcomers become regulars.
However, it is still a long way off.
Organizing committee advisor Justin Downs says the Chinese ski industry has changed beyond recognition since his last visit in 2007.
Every winter, more and more Chinese are heading to the slopes.
Fiona, a snowboarder from Beijing, is one of them.
Despite the major changes, it will take many more years to create a ski culture here, says Downs.
Many resorts are located in agricultural and mining areas.
These regions still need to be actively developed and the necessary infrastructure for recreation created there.
Gao Makong, 70, lives in Chunli, not far from the Winter Olympic venues.
He notes that in recent years there has been a boom in winter sports tourism here.
Two years ago, a high-speed railway was built from Beijing to Chunli, and now none of the local residents are suffering from unemployment.
There are more and more shops opening in the country that sell clothing and equipment for winter sports.
Food outlets with national cuisine dishes are opening on the slopes.
Taiwan now even has a COVID-19 testing station.
China is striving to create a thriving winter sports industry, its athletes must become leaders in major international competitions, and the resorts and equipment must reach world-class levels.
More than 500 million people worldwide could be pushed into extreme poverty due to the pandemic, WHO says
More than 500 million people worldwide could be pushed into extreme poverty by the coronavirus pandemic, which has stalled humanity's progress towards universal health coverage, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank (WB) said.
To mark the 12 December International Day of Universal Health Coverage, WHO and the World Bank have published two complementary reports.
They noted that the pandemic had led to disruptions in the provision of medical services and caused excessive strain on health care systems.
In this regard, for the first time in 10 years, the population’s immunization coverage has decreased, and the death rate from tuberculosis and malaria has increased.
The WHO and the World Bank stressed that the pandemic has caused "the worst economic crisis since the 1930s, making it harder for people to pay for treatment."
The situation is pushing more than 500 million people "into extreme poverty because they have to pay for these services out of their own pockets."
In October, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said the coronavirus pandemic had pushed more than 100 million people into poverty, with more than four billion people having virtually no social protection.

Reuters: Taiwanese minister cut off from Democracy Summit broadcast at White House request
Taiwan's Minister of Digital Affairs Audrey Tang's speech at a panel discussion during the U.S.-organized "Summit for Democracy" was put in video-free mode, according to the summit's YouTube recording.
Reuters, citing sources, says the image was taken down at the request of the White House.
According to their report, the reason was a map on which Taiwan was marked in a different color from the People's Republic of China, which considers the island to be its territory.
The map Ms. Tan was showing was compiled by the South African non-governmental organization CIVICUS and ranked countries in the world according to the extent to which they guarantee civil rights.
Taiwan was marked green on it as "free," while the PRC, DPRK, Laos, and Vietnam were marked red as "closed."
After the minister showed the map, the image on her side was replaced with a screenshot with a note that the opinions of the discussion participants "do not necessarily reflect the position of the U.S. government."
China was not invited to the "Summit for Democracy".
Reuters sources note that the map demonstrated by the Taiwanese minister could contradict the "One China" policy upheld by Washington.
One of the agency's sources said that after the map was displayed, the U.S. National Security Council angrily contacted the State Department, accusing it of showing Taiwan as a separate country.
The Washington-organized “Summit for Democracy” took place from December 9 to 10 with the participation of representatives from 110 countries and territories, as well as civil society organizations and charitable organizations.
Russia was not invited to the summit.
During the “zero day” of the summit, the Nobel Peace Prize laureate and chief editor of Novaya Gazeta, Dmitry Muratov, called for the creation of an international fund through which money obtained through corruption would be given to charity.
Earlier today, Deputy Secretary of the Russian Security Council, Yuri Averyanov, stated that the summit had an “anti-Russian and anti-Chinese charge”.
They feed you information as if they are preparing food, and there is rotten meat everywhere, in fact, the meat remains with the butcher until the very last piece.
The classic of journalism is to create news out of nothing.
They boil not the meat, but the horns and hooves, obtaining a substance like glue.

If I go beyond the limits, I don't throw it away, but give it to charity.

New Shepard spacecraft with six tourists on board made a suborbital flight
The New Shepard spacecraft from Blue Origin with six tourists on board made a suborbital flight on Saturday, December 11.
The journey, which was broadcast on the company's website, lasted a total of more than ten minutes, after which the capsule with the passengers descended to Earth, TASS reports.
The launch of the carrier rocket was conducted from the spaceport in the area of the American city of Van Horn (Texas).
The ship rose to an altitude of just over 100 km, and the space tourists found themselves in a state of weightlessness.
The launch vehicle itself landed normally on the launch pad.
Blue Origin successfully completed the first suborbital flight of the New Shepard spacecraft with passengers on board on July 20.

Don't lump everything together - bad people exist, you may have specific complaints against them...
But what does the number of children, age, pension fund, and so on have to do with it?
They write that they are "scum, they didn't return the money."
But how many and when to have children is not your business, as long as they do not intend to put these children around your neck.
And since this is ruled out, what right do you have to condemn them?
I guess that's just how it is in education...
The chosen (by themselves) parents dictate their own rules, openly disregarding the already existing ones.
And what if it affects other areas of life, the judicial system, and so on?
For them, the laws do not exist.
And what if dad still implements his method of upbringing and education?
It's some kind of horror and a very bad example for others.

China strengthens prevention and control of COVID-19 in cities where land ports are located
The Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism of the State Council has issued a circular to strengthen the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic in cities where land ports of entry are located in order to further prevent the importation of the infection from abroad.
According to the circular, people leaving the specified cities must provide a negative result of a COVID-19 nucleic acid test obtained within 48 hours before departure.
Those arriving in cities where land border crossings are located must take at least one COVID-19 nucleic acid test upon arrival.
The document states that these requirements will take effect from the day that the relevant provincial-level administrative units determine and publish the zones of the said cities, up to March 15, 2022.
In addition, it is noted that cities that have land checkpoints and meet certain conditions may consider the possibility of creating buffer zones for the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic within their jurisdiction.

Dimaks OK Basis mattress, size 130x185.
The OK Basis spring orthopedic mattress is one of the most affordable models in the range.
The practical Balance Foam filler gives the mattress all the necessary orthopedic properties, but at the same time keeps the price at a budget level.
This product is an optimal combination of price and quality.
Pena Balance is a modern material that is obtained from PU foam.
The filler is hypoallergenic and safe.
This is why foam is widely used in industry.
Its safety and reliability have been confirmed by a special certificate obtained in Europe, where these requirements are significantly more stringent than in Russia.
Another important quality of Balance Foam is its orthopaedics: the material supports the correct position of the body throughout the entire time of sleep.
Thanks to the foam, the mattress has a lower-than-average level of firmness, so the product is considered by the manufacturer to be quite soft.
The main load-bearing element in the mattress is the SuperSprings.
It is notable for its independent springs, with 256 elements per square meter.
The practical block can withstand a weight of up to 100 kg per sleeping place, distributes the load and adapts the surface to the sleeper, enhancing the orthopedic properties of the foam.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs spoke about the "sad conclusion" in relations between Russia and the United States
Deputy Foreign Minister of Russia Sergey Ryabkov, in an interview with Izvestia, assessed the prospects for relations between Moscow and Washington.
He noted that the long history of interaction has led to sad conclusions, and the problems between the two countries did not start yesterday.
One-sided negative predictability is there, but as for any prospects for improving relations, everything is completely unpredictable.
It's a sad conclusion after a long journey that we've been on with this administration, with Trump, with Obama.
The problems did not start yesterday," the diplomat pointed out.
According to Ryabkov, the problem is related to the United States' desire to impose its approaches on Russia on a number of issues.
The Deputy Foreign Minister added that he would not dare to make optimistic predictions about the prospects for improving relations and would not expect a change in Washington's position.
He explained that, with the exception of areas such as strategic stability and cybersecurity, no progress is being observed.
At the same time, Russia is calling on the United States to take a responsible approach to issues of international security and hopes that the signals will be heard and the Americans will listen to arguments of common sense.
Earlier, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov stated at a meeting with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken that Moscow was ready to restore dialogue with the United States.
Virologist warns of the danger of vaccinating with a nasal COVID drug outside of hospitals
People who receive the nasal COVID-19 vaccine may experience an allergic reaction and require medical assistance, so the first vaccination points for this vaccine should not be set up in airports and shopping centers.
This was reported by TASS by virologist, corresponding member of the Russian Academy of Sciences, head of the laboratory of bionanotechnology, microbiology and virology of Novosibirsk State University, Sergey Netesov.
It is easier to set up vaccination points for the nasal vaccine in airports and shopping centres, but I would do this only in medical facilities at first.
The fact is that there is a possibility of an allergic reaction to such a vaccine, it is small, but it is desirable that the person sit near the doctor's office afterwards.
Doctors have special sets of anti-allergy drugs that work in just a minute or two, which is sometimes very necessary," said Netesov.
According to the virologist, it will be possible to think about vaccination in shopping centers when experience is accumulated in the use of the drug.
He also stressed that when using the nasal vaccine, it is important that it reaches the mucous membrane in the nasal cavity.
However, there is a possibility that the vaccine will not reach its destination if the person being vaccinated blows their nose after the injection due to a blocked nose.

Serbia produced 2 million doses of the Sputnik V vaccine
The Sputnik V vaccine is the most popular in Serbia.
Serbia has produced about 2 million doses of the Russian Sputnik V vaccine, Minister of Innovation and Technological Development of the country Nenad Popovich told TASS.
"About 2 million doses of the Sputnik V vaccine have been produced at the Torlak state institute so far, and we expect at least 4 million to be produced in the coming period," said Popovic.
According to him, the Russian vaccine is the most popular among the Serbs.
In connection with this, the republic plans to make an additional purchase of a million doses of the vaccine from Russia.
The Minister of Innovation and Technological Development of Serbia also expressed interest in the production of the nasal vaccine "Sputnik V" and the "Sputnik Light" drug on the territory of the state.
Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin announced that Russia has delivered almost two million doses of the domestic Sputnik V coronavirus vaccine to Serbia.

Alexander M., please remind me how the marathon went at the 2021 World Championships?
Do you see the track on which the participants of the race should finish in classic style?
Attention, question - what is Klæbo doing to the right of Bolshunov and how does he want to get onto the ski run if he was behind him on the turn before the gate?
And the “best finisher” at 1.5 km and after 50 km are two different things.
It was a long time ago...
I was, and in fact, I wasn't even a driver.
He had the right, but he didn't know how to drive.
They offered to drive 250 km in one direction on a MAZ!
Young, bad, agreed.
The boss is nearby, he's drinking vodka, and I'm driving.
First, as a king, he took the axis!
A column of troops formed up behind me.
I missed.
Then the belt on the power steering broke.
Then the police stopped us.
The column was organized, and their car broke down.
It needs to be towed.
The owner of the MAZ explained that he was drunk, and the driver was inexperienced.
And to him - how drunk are you?
You don't trip, you don't fall.
In front of us with the flashing lights and forward!
In my opinion, he can't get out of the ads, he has every reason to be upset.
Pevtsov is also saying the same thing: about the return of the retirement age.
For a long time now, all budgets have been drawn up taking into account the billions that pre-pensioners have not received.
Who is feeding them this nonsense?
The UK recorded 1239 cases of the omicron strain of the coronavirus in a day - RT in Russian
In the UK, 1239 cases of infection with the new omicron strain of the coronavirus were identified in a day.
Sky News reports this.
In particular, 1196 new cases of the “omicron” strain were recorded in England, 38 people were infected with the new variant of the infection in Scotland, and five in Northern Ireland.
The total number of COVID-19 cases from the new strain in the UK has reached 3,137.
Earlier, scientists from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine in a pessimistic forecast calculated that in England, by April, 75,000 people could die from a coronavirus outbreak caused by the "omicron" strain.
Peskov warned of the suffering of Western countries that are introducing anti-Russian sanctions
The press secretary of the President of the Russian Federation, Dmitry Peskov, commented on the possible introduction of anti-Russian sanctions in the event of continued “aggressive actions” against Ukraine, including due to the alleged “invasion” of the country’s territory.
"It is impossible to impose restrictions on Russia and not suffer yourself," the official representative of the Kremlin said on the air of the "Russia 1" TV channel.
Peskov claims that "everyone in the world understands this."
Earlier it was reported that the United States was considering the possibility of introducing anti-Russian sanctions in the energy sector as a last resort.
In addition, Washington and the European Union plan to impose restrictions that will make it more difficult to convert rubles into dollars for Russian banks and the Russian Direct Investment Fund.
At the same time, the head of Sberbank, German Gref, is convinced that this is impossible.
From reasonable people - reasonable comments!
Something about these simple-to-the-point-of-nausea recipes makes me want to vomit.
It seems that they have run out of ideas.
Even in my distant childhood, my mother baked delicious pies and cakes, and it never occurred to me to compare a piece of bread with jam to a cake.
Ksenia, you don't need to try to get through to my mind, my mind must figure it out on its own!
"The inability of the mind separated from the Spirit to perceive" - what are you talking about?!
Imagine you need to explain this to a stupid child with your fingers, how would you do it?!
(Keep in mind that children up to 3-5 years old still have open channels of communication with the subtle world, and the child may know more than you!)
New Caledonia residents reject independence from France
According to the final results of the third referendum on the independence of New Caledonia, the overwhelming majority of participants refused to leave the French Union.
This was reported by the French TV channel BFM.TV on December 12.
96.5% of those who voted were against independence.
3.51% of the inhabitants of the archipelago in the South Pacific supported independence from France.
2.99% of ballots were annulled.
Voter turnout on that day was very low: only about 55% of the archipelago's residents went to the polls.
According to experts, the low turnout is explained by the calls of the separatists to refuse to participate in the referendum due to the coronavirus.
Paris refused to postpone the date of the referendum.
In October 2020, the residents of New Caledonia voted against independence from France in a referendum.
In 2018, a referendum on the issue of independence was already held in the region.
Most residents supported the archipelago's status as part of France.
New Caledonia is almost 20,000 kilometers from mainland France.
In 1853, France declared New Caledonia its property.
About 270,000 people live on the archipelago, which is endowed with a special administrative-territorial status.
A 1998 agreement between Paris and the New Caledonia administration allows the region to hold a vote on its independence every two years.

WHO preliminarily considers “omicron” to be less dangerous than “delta”
The World Health Organization (WHO) has preliminarily determined that “omicron” is less dangerous than the delta variant of the coronavirus.
However, there are data indicating a decrease in the effectiveness of vaccines against the new variant of COVID-19.
As of December 9, “omicron” has been registered in 63 countries.
"Preliminary data and the significantly altered antigen profile of the "omicron" strain's protein suggest a reduction in vaccine effectiveness against infection and transmission of the variant.
Preliminary findings from South Africa suggest that it ("disease severity" - rare.) may be less severe than "delta"", the WHO technical note says.
The organisation notes that so far all registered cases of "omicron" in the EU have been mild or asymptomatic.
At the same time, the new strain, according to preliminary data, spreads faster than the delta.
Two cases of infection with the omicron strain have been registered in Russia.
They were "previously immunized," the Gamaleya Center reported.
The head of Rospotrebnadzor, Anna Popova, stated that there is currently no reliable data that the new variant of the coronavirus is less dangerous than the others.

Ukraine has named four scenarios for Zelensky
Former Verkhovna Rada deputy Vadim Denisenko listed four possible scenarios for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in 2022.
In his opinion, the head of state may be left without support from the West, and he may also make compromises on Donbass.
Denisenko spoke about this on Sunday, 12 December, in a publication on the Glavred portal.
The first option, which Denisenko called "the perfect storm," suggests that key Western countries will stop supporting Ukraine, reaching an agreement on the country's future without its participation.
Such a development would set the stage for a deep crisis that Kyiv could face in 2023.
"At the same time, there is a reduction in prices for key goods that we traditionally export <...> internal protests and confrontation with the authorities and key FPGs (financial-industrial groups. - Ed.)", added the former parliamentarian.
According to Denisenko, there is another scenario for the development of the situation - "war against all".
This forecast will come true in the event of high turbulence in world politics, in which the Ukrainian authorities will face a number of problems.
Due to such a situation, the Ukrainian leadership may go for compromises on Donbass, as a result of which there may be a confrontation within the country.
At the end of the summer, Zelensky's position will weaken, and the likelihood of such a situation, according to the former People's Deputy, is up to 50-55%.
The third option for the development of the situation in Ukrainian politics is a confrontation between groups of the population that disagree with Zelensky and the president, which could result in the seizure of control over the security block and the implementation of “populist initiatives”.
In this variant of the crisis, Zelensky will begin the "reformatting of power," added Denisenko.
Another scenario is the transformation of Zelensky into the “father of the nation”.
This could be caused by some event that would be a major shock to society.
"The event must be large enough to attract the attention of external partners and lead to an increase in support for Ukraine," Denysenko said.
Such a development of the situation is possible as a result of a natural disaster, a man-made catastrophe or aggressive actions by Russia, the former deputy believes.
At the same time, the Russian side has already more than once rejected any possibility of an "attack" on Ukraine.
In Moscow, they noted that it is the Ukrainian authorities, NATO and the United States that are increasing military activity near the Russian borders.
Earlier, on November 11, the survey data from the sociological group "Rating" showed that the rating of the Ukrainian president fell to record low levels, amounting to 19.3%.
This is the lowest rating since he was elected head of state.
Analysts predicted a situation in which, in the event of the next presidential election in Ukraine, only 21.8% would vote for Zelensky, while 14.5% would vote for the former president of the country, Petro Poroshenko.
At the same time, only 19.3% of those surveyed expressed support for the president.

Thanks to the author for the story about the great athlete, I didn't know that Elena Shushunova had died, it's very upsetting to learn such news.
I remember how I was rooting for her at the Olympics in Seoul, for us, residents of Primorye, it was a live broadcast, real time.
Such a passion, the emotions were off the charts, I remember the joy when Elena won.
They also rejoiced at all the other victories, just as they cheered for Salnikov, for the football players, for all the Soviet athletes of that time.
I once saw a documentary on TV about one of the Central American countries, and there they were rolling watermelons onto the ship's deck, like barrels.
The watermelons were of a monstrous size.
I myself worked many times in my youth on the collection and loading of watermelons in the Astrakhan region and never came across watermelons weighing more than a pood.
I buy watermelons weighing 4-5 kg straight from the garden and not before the beginning of August.
Balconette bra with soft lace cups (size: 90E, colour: beige, composition: 90% polyamide, 10% elastane, item number: 12008).
Balconette bra with soft lace cups, on frames.
The lower part of the cup is reinforced with non-elastic transparent fabric.
The side of the cup, in the area of the bra strap attachment, is reinforced with non-stretchy fabric in a fold, without additional seams for comfort.
It is this element that prevents the lace from stretching.
The richness of the lace can be appreciated thanks to the frill along the neckline and under the bust.
The vertical ribs on the side panels of the single-layer microfiber prevent the fabric from twisting on larger sizes.
I really didn't like the article, it was mean and venomous.
They walked up to people they knew nothing about.

The poet arrested for the action on Red Square: "They give you 10 days for a quote from Yevtushenko, here is the power of poetry!"
At the beginning of the week, 21-year-old poet Alexander Volchenkov was arrested for ten days.
An HSE student was detained in Red Square with a placard that had the hashtag #poetofrussiaismorethanpoet written on it.
This quote belongs to the writer Evgeny Evtushenko.
A protocol was drawn up against Alexander for a repeated violation of the procedure for conducting a public action.
He was detained for the first time on January 23 at Pushkin Square, at a rally in support of Alexey Navalny.
"The goal was to draw attention to poetry in general, now interest in it, unfortunately, has been lost, to the decline of general culture in Russia, and there is also a small hope to inspire unknown poets to write their poems on the internet under this hashtag," Alexander explains.
We reached out to the young poet to find out the circumstances of his detention and to learn more about the message of his message.
How did the police officers treat you during the arrest this time and previously?
What did the department ask about, and how did they comment on your action?
This time the officers were more courteous, the arrest was as polite as possible, as funny as it sounds in the context of this word.
The OMON officers took Pushkinskaya and took it hard.
They asked the standard questions about motives.
When they heard, in principle, they looked at it, if not with approval, then with understanding.
With the exception of the monkey house, which was ventilated on all four sides, everything was perfectly correct, but I knew what I was getting into.
And if after the action under this hashtag, several people start to write their poems, I will not have spent these 10 days in vain.
Maxim, according to the protocol, talk to each other in the language of the Tumba-Yumba tribe.
At public and official events, they speak in the language of the audience so that everyone understands what happened in the Bundestag on 25 September 2001, or in their native language with an interpreter.
It is a protocol and nothing more, by the way, Angela Merkel speaks Russian very well and yet she resorts to the help of an interpreter.
And at official events, minutes are taken the old-fashioned way with a pen, and the stenographer is not required to know several languages.
If you don't want to say much, just say no!
But there is so much water.
Well, to go as a tourist for six months "to the Andes, then to Nepal".
Before that, convert all assets into liquid shares.
And gradually sell these shares, opening an account at any bank in the world.
Sell not in dollars, but in a currency less dependent on the United States, such as Swiss francs.
And then file for divorce from America.
However, this is not all that keeps Americans in the United States.
It keeps them believing that the United States is better than anywhere else.
That's how they're grown.

Researchers tell how potatoes help in the fight against age-related disorders
The study found that potatoes are rich in vitamins and trace elements that help improve blood circulation and reduce cholesterol levels.
The root vegetable contains B group vitamins, vitamin C, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, riboflavin, folic acid and pantothenic acid.
All of these elements help the body's systems to function.
In addition, potatoes help in the fight against age-related disorders.
Its high fibre content makes it beneficial for the digestive system, and regular consumption can also help prevent hypertension and atherosclerosis.
However, for the greatest benefit, the root vegetable is best stewed or boiled, and not fried in oil.
The Daily Express previously warned that potatoes can be dangerous for diabetics, just like other high glycemic index foods.
These are foods that contain carbohydrates that break down quickly into sugars, such as sugar, sweet soft drinks, white rice, and white bread.
At the beginning of December, Kommersant newspaper warned of a possible shortage of Russian table potatoes, noting a reduction in its production in personal subsidiary farms and an increase in processing capacity.
According to market participants, the current shortage of products can only be filled by imports.
Lostfilm, lordfilm and other pirates will be removed from Yandex's search results
Candidates for elimination
In 2015, rights holders from the RAEC/Media cluster compiled a list of the 100 largest pirate sites on the RuNet, and most of them ceased to exist, says Karen Kazaryan, CEO of the Institute for Internet Research.
But some - Kinogo, Lostfilm, Filmix - have managed to survive thanks in part to regularly changing their domain name, he adds.
For example, on Lostfilm, which is available in the search results of both "Yandex" and Google, you can watch pirated copies of the Netflix series "Squid Game" and "Tenderness" directed by Anna Melikyan - the original series of the largest video service in Russia, ivi (which is part of AIV).
On Kinogo, which is also available in search engine results, you can watch the animated novelty "Encanto", but, judging by the video quality, it is a so-called screener (a pirated copy of the film recorded in a movie theater).
The series "Univer. 10 Years Later" from the TNT channel (which is part of Gazprom-Media) is available on Filmix, which can also be found via search engines.
Svetlana M., I'm sorry, of course, but I wouldn't care if my son was upset on his mother's behalf or not.
If we have some kind of misunderstanding, it's better not to get involved at all, and just sweep it under the rug.
Of course, it's good that this happens rarely.

Lyudmila, China is now at the forefront of space technology.
Russia is already hopelessly behind.
"This idea developed by the Poles" - it would be more accurate to say that Poland only adapted the idea of 1776 for itself, but developed it quite effectively.
In fact, the slogan "The periphery is not Russia" appeared in 1848.
Which, in general and in principle, does not really change the essence of the matter.
I watched her interview, the girl said that her biggest dream is to grow wings, her father is always pulling her down.
Well, it's all very dubious.
Well, I got into a university, but what's next?
Maytoni MOD081WL-L13G3K Tessara wall light.
The wide circumference, framed by “molecules” of light, provides the most even and bright lighting of the space.
"Atomic" or "molecular" design, which reflects the nature and natural essence of each item, remains relevant and allows you to effectively set accents in the interior.
One of the characteristic features of such lamps is the weightlessness of the design.
Using thin, almost invisible wires that can be adjusted in height, the illusion is created that the chandelier is hovering in the air.
The metallic gold hardware and matte white mini-pendant lights will easily complement any palette, and the pendant chandelier and wall sconces in the collection will be a ready-made ensemble for lighting a living room, bedroom, or hallway.
Well, it's a matter of taste, as they say.
I really liked Tarkhun, not the current one, of course.
The freshly squeezed juices from the tall glass cylinders were very tasty.
Three servings of syrup is overkill, in my opinion.
Two was just right.
Dimatex Micro Ultimate mattress, size 160x190
Micro Ultimate orthopedic spring mattress.
The model is convenient in that it has two different softness surfaces - high stiffness and slightly above average.
The product includes only high-quality and premium fillers, which have proven themselves only from the best side.
Springs: in the center of the model is a block of independent "micro-pack" springs.
This means that there are 2000 springs per sleeping place, which work independently of each other.
It is their functioning that gives the unique point-by-point adjustment.
The "Micropack" is the highest frequency of all the variety of Dimax spring blocks, so it has a pronounced orthopedic effect and is considered premium.
Fillers: above and below the springs are combinations of layers of coir and natural latex.
The only difference is the order of the tiles.
If one side has latex, the other side has coconut coir.
Such a tandem of fillers has long been considered classic, since it gives the mattress not only orthopedic, but also anatomical properties.
If coir provides proper back support, then latex gives surface adaptation to the human body.
Cover: the model comes with a quilted jersey Aloe Vera cover.
At the customer's request, it can be made either removable or stationary.
The overall height of the product is 27 cm, and the recommended load on the sleeping area is 170 kg.
Warranty and safety: the warranty period is 3 years.
The mattress has all the necessary certificates and documents that confirm its complete safety and reliability in use.
The orthopedic foam used in the mattress has a CertiPUR certificate.
Estonian scientists will look for life on Venus
The Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in collaboration with the Tartu Observatory and other research institutions and companies, is preparing three space missions to Venus to search for signs of life in the atmosphere, Aktuaalne Kaamera reported on Sunday.
The goal of the missions launching in five years is to assess the habitability of Venus's clouds, and then search for life there.
For the project, the Tartu scientists proposed instruments for measuring the acidity and oxygen content of Venus's clouds.
Until now, it was thought that Venus' clouds, the closest planet to Earth, were too acidic to support life, but Venus was probably an Earth-like planet to begin with.
A sample from Venus is due to arrive during the third mission.
If we find life there, the main question will be whether it is like Earth life or different.
If it is very similar, it will be obvious that life on Earth did not start on Earth.
If it is different, then it is more likely that life began on Earth," said the head of the Estonian team of the Venus Life Finder project, Mihkel Pajusalu.

Metaverses will change Russian business
The metaverse became a hot topic this fall when Mark Zuckerberg announced Facebook's transformation into Meta.
For the market, this event was an important signal: the largest player confirmed the development of a new format of digital interaction between people.
And this means that business in Russia, like everywhere else in the world, will invest in the creation of its own metaverses and their subsequent monetization.
The metaverse should be considered as a continuation of objectively existing trends.
On the one hand, there is a trend towards creating remote interactions in the conditions of the pandemic, because people are tired of isolation and restrictions.
On the other hand, it is the result of businesses’ efforts to develop ecosystems and adapt their operational models to them.
The third - they are a logical continuation of the trend of digitization of assets, when any rights, securities, works of art and even money are transferred to digital format.
Ania, you are right, changing your diet is a conscious process.
When you start eating properly, you no longer want anything too fatty and harmful.
Of course, we will have the traditional Olivier salad and herring under a fur coat for the holiday, but no one is forcing me to eat everything at once.
You can eat it by the spoonful, try it - and that's enough.
After all, there are really ten days off ahead, so you can prepare any delicious and healthy dishes.
And how much hellish effort, time, and resources she put into her training.
And by doing 5 quadruple jumps, she was left without gold.
And she also understands that she won't last four years until the next Olympics, i.e. she will never be an Olympic champion.
And if you haven't been involved in just sports or can't imagine the hell she's been through, DON'T JUDGE.
The British economist failed to predict 2022
British economist Jim O'Neill was unable to make a forecast for 2022, because, in his opinion, such attempts will end in failure.
He wrote about this in an article for Project Syndicate.
The expert believes that the next year will be full of unpredictability and any trend can change the turnover.
The most important factor remains the coronavirus pandemic, and inflation is in second place, he believes.
O'Neill also admitted he did not know if the price rises were temporary or not.
As the specialist pointed out, even before the pandemic it was clear that "the world of the central banks' boundless generosity has outlived itself" and it was time to return to a relationship where interest rates, taking inflation into account, would correlate with expected GDP growth rates.
O'Neill noted that against the backdrop of the pandemic, the continuation of ultra-loose economic policy could, according to some experts, lead to a new surge in inflation.
In addition, attention should be paid to the issue of productivity growth, as well as the increase in poverty and climate change, concluded O'Neill.
Earlier, the head of Global Research at Otkritie Investment Mikhail Shulgin said that positive expectations for the dollar exchange rate in 2022 remain, but the growth potential will be less significant.
Among the risks to the dollar exchange rate, Shulgin named the monetary and credit policy of the Federal Reserve, the dynamics of oil prices, and concerns amid the coronavirus pandemic.
I have to agree.
But one thing is pleasing: if you compare yourself with yourself, then five years ago there were fewer containers.
Now it's better.
There is progress, but it is slow.
There is another problem: there are many environmental initiatives in the cities, but people don't know about them.
All kinds of eco-taxis that take waste from home.
Yes, a recycling drop-off point - it's used by the dregs of society.
Rarely do people take glass and metal there.

Sausages with "cat" in Soviet factories?
"Low-quality" chocolate in the USSR?
Well, yes, they're not as tasty as Doshirak, I understand...
And I would now wrap up Soviet sweets with white filling.
There are no more of them.
They're not releasing "The Pilot," and "Chamomile" isn't the same at all...

Russians gave car dealers about 4.5% of the country's GDP
According to the results of 10 months of 2021, Russians spent 2.784 trillion rubles on the purchase of new cars, which is 28% more than during the same period last year, according to statistical data from the Russian Automotive Market Research (RAMR) agency.
To put it in perspective, a similar amount (about 3 trillion roubles) was spent by the government to support citizens and the economy during the coronavirus pandemic.
In September last year, at a meeting of the heads of states of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, President Vladimir Putin said that such an amount is comparable to more than 4.5% of the country's gross domestic product (GDP) for 2020.
In terms of revenue, the Korean brand Kia is leading the Russian market.
In the first 10 months of this year, he managed to sell cars worth 325.7 billion rubles, which is almost 24% more than a year earlier.
The related Kia brand of Hyundai has seen an even greater increase - more than 35%, and revenue from the sale of cars is estimated at 279.3 billion rubles.
This brand is in the lead in terms of the growth in the average weighted price of a car - over the year, it increased by almost 21%, to 1.94 million roubles - only Changan, Chery, Geely and Mercedes-Benz had a higher price increase.
At the same time, the volume of sales of Korean brands has not grown as significantly: according to the statistics of the car manufacturers committee of the Association of European Businesses in Russia, in quantitative terms, Kia sold 9.4% more cars during the same period than the year before.
Hyundai - almost 12%.
Rounding out the top three in terms of sales volume in monetary terms is the Japanese Toyota - Russians spent 275.5 billion rubles on cars of this brand in 10 months, which is 14% more than a year earlier.
The Japanese are followed by Mercedes-Benz with a figure of 266.1 billion rubles (+75%) - the German premium brand has increased both its sales volume (by 37%) and the average weighted price of a car (almost by 28%, up to 8.2 million rubles).
“Mercedes-Benz is experiencing a good growth in sales and average price at the same time – more, for example, than BMW – which is why it is experiencing a greater growth in financial capacity”, explained the CEO of NAPI, Tatiana Arabadjieva.
In terms of sales growth, Chinese brands are showing fantastic figures, and have also significantly increased their financial capacity this year."
Russian Lada is demonstrating average market growth in terms of income (plus 28%), and Russians spent 229.4 billion roubles on cars of this brand in 10 months.
Companies whose car sales in units fell in 2021 are at the same level of financial capacity as last year: in particular, Volkswagen, Mitsubishi and Nissan.
UAZ is in the red - over the course of 10 months, Russians spent 12 billion roubles on off-road vehicles and pickups of this brand, compared to 12.4 billion roubles the year before.
Against the backdrop of problems with the supply of auto components and production disruptions that have affected the entire global automotive industry, car companies continue to continuously adjust prices - AvtoVAZ itself raised the price of Lada models seven times in a year, the last price increase (by 8-10 thousand rubles) took place at the end of November.
Other car manufacturers regularly change the price tags on their products.
The volume of the Russian car market in monetary terms will continue to increase - in addition to the shortage of cars, inflation is also contributing to this, as well as the desire of car manufacturers to make up for past losses, experts believe.
In the context of a shortage of cars, I think that many car manufacturers have even been able to pass on some of the costs of previous periods, which they were not able to include in the price of cars before,
says VTB Capital analyst for the automotive industry Vladimir Bespalov.
I believe that car manufacturers are doing very well financially, maintaining high margins on sales."
A secondary indicator of this is the rate of growth in the cost of cars, which has been observed throughout 2021, with the prices of new cars growing faster than inflation, the expert clarifies.
In the long term, the market will grow both in terms of quantity and in terms of money, but mainly due to inflation and the increasing complexity of the machines themselves, predicts Bespalov.
With increased supply, opportunities to raise prices will be limited.
In monetary terms, the Russian car market will continue to grow next year, even if the growth in car prices slows down, car manufacturers will be able to get their income from volumes, notes independent automotive industry consultant Sergey Burgazlyev.
Given the high demand and low supply, car manufacturers are now trying to make the most profit from each car sold, notes Burgazlyev.
It is not expected that there will be an increase in the production of cars for at least the next six months, and in Russia, the frenzy is further fueled by the uncertainty of citizens about the future.
Against the backdrop of the situation on the market, cars turned out to be a good investment object - a car bought a year ago, even with mileage, can now be sold for more than its original price, the expert notes.
Biden spoke about the transfer of US military to Ukraine in the event of a Russian invasion
The US leadership has never considered sending American troops to Ukraine in the event of a "Russian invasion".
This was stated by US President Joe Biden.
"There have never been such plans," the head of the White House said in response to a journalist's question about whether the United States had abandoned such an idea.
Biden noted that in the event of an escalation of the situation around Ukraine, Russia will face economic consequences.
At the same time, he emphasized that the United States and NATO have no obligations to use military force to protect Ukraine in the event of an escalation.
The American leader also stated that the possibility of using American troops unilaterally to defend Ukraine is not on the agenda.
Biden explained that if Russia invades Ukraine, the United States will deploy forces to NATO countries in Eastern Europe (Bulgaria, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Estonia).
"We're going to have to put more American and NATO troops on the eastern flank, the B9 - all those NATO countries that we have a sacred obligation to protect from any attack from Russia," Biden said.
Earlier, the press secretary of the President of Russia, Dmitry Peskov, emphasized that Moscow has no intention of invading the territory of Ukraine.
At the same time, he pointed out that Moscow sees the problem in the combat use of the drones supplied by Turkey by Kyiv, as well as in the fact that “American weapons are approaching our territory”.
I immediately leave such interviews.
If during the interview they want to make me listen to screams, wait for hours, drink an incomprehensible brew and wash a cup - it's scary to imagine what it will be like at work.
I'll find a normal place for myself, without the HR layer, where you can talk directly to the manager.
Promtex-Orient Monolit Combi 16 mattress 100x185 cm
The medium-height, springless Promtex-Orient Monolith Combi 16 mattress is made from alternating layers of natural latex and coconut coir.
One side is medium-firm, the other is moderately firm.
The elegant white jacquard cover is quilted with a polyester filling and has a zipper around the perimeter.
Two types of filler.
The sandwich model consists of eight layers of fillings.
Thin sheets of coconut coir are laid between the layers of latex.
The layered structure of the mattress is distinguished by its increased wear resistance, durability and resistance to loads.
Natural latex is a dense, elastic, breathable material by its characteristics.
The filler maintains its shape and quickly recovers after loads.
Coconut coir strengthens the product and has natural antimicrobial properties.
The combination of these two materials allows us to create a load-bearing orthopedic sleeping place that will serve customers for many years.
Versatility and orthopedic support.
The mattress is suitable for people of different body types and ages.
The medium-firm surface is universally balanced with a combination of orthopedic support and comfort.
The reverse side of the model is less comfortable for soft tissues, but has more pronounced orthopedic properties.
A moderately firm sleeping surface is more relevant for those who need to "unload" their back and maintain a healthy posture.
The mattress is suitable for both a single person and a couple.
The latter will particularly appreciate the presence of a stable surface and the absence of the "wave" effect, when vibrations on one side of the mattress can be transmitted to the opposite side, disturbing a person's sleep.

If a scammer calls from a number like this, like a "police officer" or another law enforcement official, then it is not effective to just hang up, and it is likely that you will not have time to add them to the blacklist.
Because to confirm his lie about his connection to the power structures, he quickly repeats the challenge and continues to intimidate and persuade.
We need more useful recommendations for the people.
That's just rubbish...
I don't really believe that it was like that.
They don't know what to come up with, who to blame.
The Queen has been reached.
And most importantly, in their opinion, everyone is to blame, except for the very most...
Wouldn't it have been easier to leave people alone from coercion, of course, if our people care about their people.
Maybe all the virus strains will disappear...
As in Japan... before the elections, they weakened the influence and the number of infections decreased...
The felting wool set "Assortment No. 2" is 100% merino, wool 4x10 g.

Maria Kartashova, what does "in response to this" mean?
I, on the other hand, do not voice my thoughts; I mentally curse you all.
I mentally behead everyone who didn't give me their seat, I mentally send them into the gutter and burn all the cars that get in my way, mentally, all of them!
And I can even smile at you.
But I remember that thought is material!
Peter, Nicholas II did not sign a single death sentence during his reign.
Even to such lawbreakers as Koba and his gang.

A film by Alexander Sokurov’s student won the European “Oscar” for best editing
The Russian film “Unclenching the Fists”, nominated for an Oscar, received an award from the European Film Academy (also known as the “European Oscar”) in the category of “Best Editing”, reports Moskovsky Komsomolets.
The contest's jury, which voted online due to the difficult epidemiological situation, assessed the outstanding skill of the film's creators.
The maximum number of awards this time went to the film by Jasmila Žbanić (Bosnia) "Where Are You Going, Aida?"
The main character of the film is an interpreter for a UN mission who is trying to save her family during the war in Yugoslavia.
As for the drama "Unclenching the Fists", directed by Kira Kovalenko (a graduate of Alexander Sokurov's workshop), this film tells the story of the difficult relationship between a powerful father and his children who are growing up and want to break free from their father's control in North Ossetia.
Earlier, it was announced that this film was nominated for the Oscar film award as the best film made in a foreign language.
As the regular friendly meetings of the presidents of Russia, Azerbaijan, and Turkey show, in my opinion, you, to put it mildly, are not in the know.
Only yesterday, the President of Azerbaijan approved the opening of a joint Azerbaijani-Russian enterprise KamAZ.
