In my opinion, the literature program was formed by women of Balzac's age based on their interests.
From Russian literature of the 19th century, we preferred Danilevsky and Volkonsky.
They wrote fiction, of course, from the point of view of those very ladies of a certain age.
And the psychology and suffering of Tolstoy's and Turgenev's heroines is not so interesting for teenagers.
Teenagers are rarely interested in the psychology of heroes.
Thank you very much, it was very interesting.

Promtex Micropacket Prestige 105х195 mattress.
The "Micropack Prestige" model: comfort and natural ingredients.
The mattress has different sides of different firmness: the medium-firm surface is made of latex-coated coconut fibre and natural latex, and the moderately soft side is made of a plate of natural latex.
The 1000-spring-per-square-metre spring unit quickly adapts to the sleeper's body, preventing the "wave" or "hammock" effect.
Among the benefits of the model, it is worth noting the breathable materials.
Latex, which is perforated for air permeability, ventilates naturally as well as coir.
This maintains a healthy microclimate in the sleeping area.
The mattress also comes with an extended warranty.
The official guarantee period from the manufacturer is 5 years, but in fact the mattress will last longer.
Dust and dirt protection is provided by a removable jacquard cover that is included.
Pair your mattress with an orthopedic pillow - it is recommended to maintain the optimal position of the spine during sleep.
The filling determines the purpose of the sides - the coconut serves as anatomical support for the back, the latex relaxes the muscles.
Use your brain and get rid of such relatives!
It's better to have none than ones like these...

Andrey, you have been clearly explained that pensioners work in schools, they will not work in the command line.
The computer science teacher won't be able to help either, he wasn't taught this, the school kids are playing games in Windows.
So there is no support.
I remember with horror these banquets and the guests at my parents' home.
The guests are at the door, and the meatballs are still being finished off on the stove, and the mother is shampooing the floor.
Lord, I was already exhausted by the time I sat down at the table.
And then do the dishes, clean the house.
A week before the holiday you drag groceries, two days of cooking, and a day of cleaning up after.
What about the guests?
They are doing well, and they always bring a cake with them.
Since then, I don't like holidays, guests.
Even for my family, I set the table with the bare minimum.
And I cook treats for them, I bake very often just for the sake of it.
Germany: Fourth coronavirus vaccination is inevitable
A fourth vaccination will be required in the summer or fall of 2022.
According to the expert, the current vaccination in Germany will not be the final one, but will continue with renewed vigour.
Despite an intensive vaccination campaign in Germany, neither two nor three doses of the coronavirus vaccine will probably be enough for full protection.
This is the belief of the head of the Association of General Practitioners, Ulrich Weigeldt.
Die Welt reported this on Saturday, 11 December.
"We expect that the fourth vaccination will be required in the summer, at the latest in the autumn," the expert believes.
In addition, Weigel hopes that the fourth coronavirus vaccination can be carried out "in combination with the flu vaccination".
This will help to achieve the best results.
In addition, enhanced vaccination may help in the fight against the spread of the new Omicron strain of the coronavirus.
Moreover, the new variant is especially dangerous.
For example, the probability of reinfection with Omicron is three times higher than with the Delta or Beta strains.
This is evidenced by the results of a preliminary study conducted in South Africa.
Based on this, the BioNTech/Pfizer manufacturers plan to provide a vaccine adapted to Omicron by March 2022.
The companies emphasize that two doses of the vaccine do not provide sufficient protection against infection with the new Omicron variant of the coronavirus.
The BioNTech and Pfizer study showed that with two doses of the vaccine, the effectiveness is significantly lower: "the neutralizing potential is reduced by more than 25 times".
"This indicates that two doses of BNT162b2 do not provide sufficient protection against infection with the Omicron variant," BioNTech and Pfizer stressed.
Therefore, a third dose is needed.
Experts insist on accelerating the pace of vaccination in the country.
For example, the chairman of the German Society for Infectious Diseases, Bernd Salzberger, is in favour of reducing the interval between the second and third vaccinations.
Moreover, according to Salzberger, accelerated vaccination will have an impact on the spread of both the delta virus and the omicron variant of the coronavirus.
"The experience of Israel shows this very convincingly," the expert emphasized.
Pontoon21 wobler Bet-A Vib, 54 Silent, 54 mm, 8.5 g.
The Bet-A-Vib series is a special branch of the Bet-A family from Pontoon21®.
It (like the Kalikana Vib series) differs from many other vibes in that it was originally designed with ice fishing in mind, not just for trolling.
These vibes have a greater specific weight than similar-sized analogues, which, without a doubt, has a positive effect on the nuances of the use of these interesting lures.
Another recognizable feature is the top fin made of hard and elastic plastic, which creates additional shades of vibration during vertical and horizontal wiring.
As a "winter vibe" when fishing vertically, the Bet-A-Vib demonstrates a fairly aggressive game.
Often the most effective is simple monotonous animation, that is, the movement of the lure up and down with almost no pauses.
When planning, the deviation from the vertical axis is not very large, which is convenient when fishing in a limited space, cluttered with underwater vegetation, snags and other obstacles that can be caught on.
In addition, a slight deviation is relevant when catching winter pike and large perch, and especially in the middle of winter, when a pinpoint and aggressive presentation of the lure is required.
Reaching the end of its trajectory, the Bet-A-Vib instantly reverses and returns to its original vertical.
Bet-A-Vib is no less successful for winter fishing for pond trout.
To accommodate its whims, you can choose from two modifications: with a noise capsule (NS – NanoSound) or without it (SL – Silent).
It is also noted that the Bet-A-Vib is capable of irritating a passive pike that does not even react to a live bait.
When casting, the Bet-A-Vib demonstrates range and accuracy.
This wobbler is easy to understand and not capricious, it works well with both monofilament and braided lines even of large diameters.
For catching pike, bream, roach or perch, in addition to the uniform, the "step" is also relevant, sometimes with "chattering" on the bottom.
If you are fishing in snaggy areas, you can change the front treble hook for a double, which will reduce the chances of snagging.
Among the lures of its class, the Bet-A-Vib is one of the most reliable and, as a result, one of the most effective.
It can be used with equal success on both relatively shallow and fairly deep sections.
All models are equipped with Owner ST-36 hooks.
How many young idlers sit on the necks of old parents.

Libya reports 7,000 Russian mercenaries
More than 7,000 mercenaries from the private military company (PMC) Wagner are in Libya.
This was stated on Sunday, 12 December, by the chairman of the republic's Supreme State Council, Khaled al-Mishri.
"Currently, there are more than 7,000 Wagner PMC mercenaries in Libya.
They also have planes.
They are also digging trenches in Sirte and Kufra.
They have 30 jet aircraft at the Hardebia airbase (which is also used as a civilian airport in Sirte)," the Anadolu agency quotes him as saying.
Khaled al-Mishri also pointed out that Russian mercenaries are "trying to take over" the central part of Libya, stretching from Chad to the Mediterranean Sea, after "bringing their man to power" in the Central African Republic.
Remain present
According to the publication’s source, Moscow was looking for a country to maintain its presence in North Africa and “settled on Libya”.
“Wagner” has been in Libya since 2019, using the airbase and port in Sirte, as well as the airbase in Jufra, the agency notes in its publication.
Russian authorities officially deny that the Wagner PMC is supported by the Kremlin.
Where else could the mercenaries be?
According to the agency, "Wagner" is believed to be operating in nine African countries - the Central African Republic, Libya, Sudan, Mozambique, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Madagascar, Zimbabwe and Angola.
The company provides military training for local forces, personal protection for leaders and protection for energy facilities.
In exchange for these services, Wagner’s subsidiaries receive certain privileges and licenses for the use of mineral resources and natural resources, as well as for the supply of weapons, technologies and military services to these countries”, the article states.
According to the media, the "Wagnerites" allegedly fought in Donbass, Syria, Mozambique, Sudan and the Central African Republic.
This group is not listed in the law enforcement agencies, nor in the register of legal entities, and its fighters are absent from the official lists of personnel.
This company is under U.S. sanctions.
Recall that earlier, the permanent representatives of 27 EU countries approved restrictions against the Wagner group.
The Council of the European Union is expected to approve this decision on 13 December.
The situation in Libya
The Supreme State Council of Libya is in fact the second chamber of parliament with advisory functions, dominated by Islamists, writes TASS.
This body has repeatedly called for the postponement of the single day of voting for the election of parliamentarians and the head of state from 24 December at least until February 2022.
"There are less than two weeks left until the elections, and the chances of them being held on time are rapidly decreasing," the article notes.
Against this backdrop, the Libyan High Election Commission has indefinitely postponed the announcement of the final list of candidates, Sky News Arabia reports.
Foreign policy through the eyes of Russians
38% of Russians see more successes than failures in the country's foreign policy, 29% believe that failures predominate.
"Examples of success are "in Syria, we protected and restored peace there", "the decision on Nord Stream 2", "the whole world was scared that we had a powerful weapon", "we took Crimea".
The main failures are “conflict with Ukraine”, “confrontation with western countries”, and “isolation from the world”, according to a study by the Public Opinion Foundation.
The Dubai government has completely abandoned paper-based administration - all government services have also become digital only
The Dubai government has announced a complete move away from paper-based administration to digital technologies.
All public services to the population will also be provided exclusively in electronic form.
This is reported by the Emirati news agency WAM.
"Today marks the beginning of a new phase of digitisation of all aspects of life in Dubai - we have completed the transition to a fully paperless government," said Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Crown Prince of the emirate and Chairman of the Dubai Executive Council, on Saturday.
Now, the internal and external document circulation in all government institutions in Dubai will be carried out only in digital form through special information platforms.
The innovation affected all sectors without exception: healthcare, utilities, police, municipal authorities, courts, and so on. Many commercial structures also joined the government's initiative.
The transition to electronic government and the digitization of document circulation began in Dubai in 2018.
In that time, the authorities have calculated that 336 million sheets of paper have been saved, which is equivalent to 14 million hours of human labour and $353.8 million in monetary terms.
Earlier, Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin stated that electronic services save citizens 2 days a year.

These people knew for sure that there was someone in the house...
Turkey's car production, exports fall below 2020 levels
Turkey's car production and exports fell sharply in November amid the lira's devaluation.
As a result, the industry's performance for the first 11 months was worse than last year's result, Bloomberg reports, citing data from the Turkish Automotive Manufacturers Association.
According to the association, 115,000 cars were released from factories in Turkey in November, which is 20% less than a year earlier.
Around 75,900 cars were exported, which is more than 25% less than last year's figure.
And if the results of the first 10 months of this year, the Turkish automotive sector demonstrated positive dynamics compared to last year, then according to the results of 11 months of 2021, car production was already 0.3% worse than last year's figure.
The reason for such a fall was the sharp depreciation of the Turkish lira, which in November fell by 29% against the dollar.
This led to a decline in economic activity across all sectors.
More than 500 SMEs received a credit payment deferral in 2021
The First Deputy Prime Minister, Alihan Smailov, spoke about the situation with the provision of benefits for small and medium-sized businesses, a correspondent for the Kazinform MIA reports.
"According to information from the Republic of Kazakhstan Agency for Regulation and Supervision of Financial Market, in accordance with the instruction of the Head of State dated April 1, 2021, the Chairman of the Agency's order dated April 9, 2021, No. 127 "On the approval of the Procedure for granting payment deferrals on loans to small and medium-sized businesses" was adopted," Alihan Smailov wrote in his response to the deputy's request.
He recalled that the procedure for deferring loan payments provided for banks and organizations engaged in microfinance to provide a deferral of payments on loans issued before April 1, 2021 to MSMEs, including sole proprietors, in the period from April 1 to June 30, 2021.
The deferral period was from 30 to 90 days, depending on the choice of the SME.
The borrower's application may have specified a different payment deferral period.
During the deferral period for the borrower, the creditor suspended claims and lawsuits, notification of the need to repay the overdue debt, and the collection of fees and other payments from the borrower," the deputy prime minister noted.
In 2021, second-tier banks received requests for loan payment deferrals from 603 SME borrowers, of which 553 SME borrowers received a deferral in the amount of 9.7 billion tenge.
131 SMEs applied for a deferral to the MFIs, of which 95 SMEs were granted a deferral for a sum of 105.8 million tenge," concluded A. Smailov.
The pulmonologist Puryasev suggested that people with a weak immune system are able to easily tolerate the "omicron" strain
The doctor suggested that people with a weakened immune system may be able to tolerate it better than those with a strong immune response
The pulmonologist Sergey Puryashev explained why the omicron strain of the coronavirus could be dangerous.
The reason is to be found in the conditions in which the virus originated.
Scientists believe that the "okmyron" originated in the body of an HIV-infected or immunocompromised person.
That is, when it mutated, it did not encounter any resistance from the immune system.
This makes him more aggressive.
Because there was no immune response, it became very fast.
Apparently, there are more of these spike proteins, spikes, than there should be, and their antibodies did not reduce during the mutations, says pulmonologist Sergey Puryashev.
The doctor suggested that people with a weakened immune system may tolerate "ocmiron" better than those with a strong immune response.
It turns out that a strong response by the body to anything, any infection, is not always a good thing.
In such cases, the body can kill itself.
This is what happens with pneumococcal infections, when young people in their 30s die, and old people in their 60s can get through it with just a sneeze.
The immune response is crazy in young people, it is completely inadequate: where you could only threaten with a finger, it hits like a cannon on sparrows, - concluded Sergey Puryasev.
The doctor also reminded that the coronavirus has dangerous side effects and the most unpleasant of them is pneumonia.
Pneumonia can be bacterial or viral.
If the first is treated very successfully and quickly, in the second case, it is often only possible to treat the symptoms - all hope is on the body.
The first sign of developing pneumonia will be the beginning of intoxication of the body - this is a fever, weakness, malaise.
Then come the respiratory symptoms: difficulty breathing, a sore throat, a cough.
Pain on the right or left, or abdominal pain, can also indicate a developing problem.
Meanwhile, in Russia, they may start vaccinating the younger generation from 12 to 18 years old by the end of the year.
The virologist, head of the genome engineering laboratory at the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology, Pavel Volchkov, noted that this category is very actively suffering from COVID-19.
For children who go to school, the number of contacts is at its maximum.
This is the most socially active group, just like the children in kindergartens, said Pavel Volchkov, a virologist and head of the Laboratory of Genomic Engineering at the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology, to Moscow 24.
Huge thanks to the author for this article.

Immunologists have put forward a hypothesis as to why people with obesity become victims of COVID
The authors of the study examined the fatty tissue left over from bariatric operations and found that fat cells, known as adipocytes, can be infected by the coronavirus.
Immune cells located in the fatty tissue, macrophages, were also infected, and showed a strong inflammatory response.
The scientists also examined the fatty tissue of patients who died from Covid and found particles of the coronavirus in the fat surrounding various organs.
It is known that HIV and influenza viruses can hide in fatty tissue, using it as a reservoir, in an attempt to evade the immune system's response.
It is likely that SARS-CoV-2 is also capable of doing this.
A biologist has spoken about the causes of dementia
Candidate of biological sciences, Semen Golosheikin, named the causes of dementia and spoke about ways to prevent it in an interview with Sputnik radio.
According to the WHO, more than 55 million people suffer from this disease.
The syndrome is characterized by a gradual loss of cognitive functions - over time, a person with the syndrome has difficulty even in familiar surroundings.
Golosheikin noted that the most common causes of dementia are neurodegenerative disorders, head injuries, some infections, metabolic disorders, and a lack of certain vitamins.
Some factors increase the risk of developing the disease.
This includes hypertension, diabetes, high cholesterol, obesity, depression and alcoholism.
At the behavioural level, factors such as social isolation and lack of active cognitive engagement may play a role," he said.
Dementia is also influenced by bad habits - smoking, alcohol abuse, sleep disorders and a sedentary lifestyle.
Among the first signs, the expert noted forgetfulness, inability to concentrate and a decrease in the level of abstract thinking.
"There is a debate that hearing loss can be both an early sign of Alzheimer's disease and a risk factor for it," the biologist added.
To prevent the onset of the disease, the WHO recommends maintaining a sufficient level of physical activity, training cognitive skills and abilities that require the involvement of memory and logic.
Earlier, the professor of the Department of Neurology, Neurosurgery and Medical Genetics of the Federal State Budgetary Educational Institution of Higher Education RSMU named after N.I. Pirogov.
N.I. Pirogov, head of the Department of Cognitive Disorders at the Federal Center for the Brain and Neurotechnologies, Anna Bogolepova, spoke about the causes of memory problems.
Egypt has returned about 30,000 artifacts illegally taken out of the country
Over the past 10 years, the Cairo government has managed to return about 30,000 artifacts that were illegally smuggled out of the country.
This was reported on Saturday, 11 December, on the Al-Hayat TV channel by the chief inspector of the Department of Returned Antiquities of the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities of Egypt, Shaaban Abdel Gawad.
Since 2011, the Egyptian state has managed to recover 29,300 artifacts.
Just this year, 5,300 artifacts of ancient Egyptian civilization were discovered at the Museum of the Bible in Washington," he said.
Abdel Gawad clarified that all the smuggled artifacts are registered in the archives.
Currently, the department's employees are working on their return to Egypt.
In particular, specialists “are monitoring auctions all over the world and online sales” through foreign and Egyptian websites, as well as social networks.
The chief inspector said that once returned, the cultural treasures are restored and then put on display in museums.
One of the returned artifacts was an ancient human skeleton found in Belgium, which is now part of the National Museum of Egyptian Civilization in Cairo, he said.
In 2020, the Egyptian authorities appealed to Interpol for help in finding the auctioned bust of the pharaoh Tutankhamun.
The Christie's auction house held an auction on July 4, at which the bust, which is more than 3,000 years old, was sold for $5.97 million (about 680 million rubles).
This has caused discontent from Egypt.
The Egyptian side also claims that the artwork was illegally taken out of the Karnak Temple in Luxor in the 1970s.
The head of Tutankhamun, depicted as the sun god Amun, had been in a private collection and had not been offered for sale since 1985.
It is unknown how the relic came to Europe.
Egypt has been actively seeking the repatriation of antiquities illegally taken from the country at different times in recent years.
According to the authorities, 95% of smuggled antiquities are the result of archaeological excavations by "black diggers".
"The Crimean Tatars are not taken into account" - and this is correct, because the Crimean Tatars (232,000) are an independent people (close to the Turks).
If you want to add, then only 42 thousand people - that is how many Kazan Tatars live in Crimea (see the census).
The Crimean Tatars are a separate people, and the name of this people consists of two words!
They are only united by the Turkic language group.
FT: Credit Suisse wants access to employees' personal mobile devices
Credit Suisse is asking its employees to give the bank access to their personal mobile devices, the Financial Times reports.
The fact is that in Europe and the United States, the Swiss bank does not issue its employees corporate communication devices, instead offering a discount on the purchase of a mobile phone or smartphone from a partner - a telecommunications operator.
Under current rules, banks can monitor information on corporate devices issued to their employees as they are used to conduct business with colleagues or clients.
The bank has the right to check mobile devices in extreme cases - for example, if an employee used it to conduct a meeting with a client that was not approved by Credit Suisse.
Now, with many employees working from home, the bank wants to extend this rule to all devices used to conduct business.
According to the newspaper, the bank's management has set a deadline by which employees can become familiar with the new rule.
Credit Suisse has not officially commented on the new requirement.

Part 4
The last year of Sergei Yesenin’s life - 1925 - was fruitful in terms of creativity, but the most difficult for the poet’s earthly existence and his “ego”.
He is no longer part of any literary associations, he has outgrown imagism, he is on his own, but he is known, in demand, sometimes strongly criticized by critics, even maliciously, but the reading public is ready to carry him on their hands.
More than 60 poems were written in a year, many of them are real masterpieces, the cycle "Persian Motifs" was completed, the poem "Anna Snegina" was written, 8 books were published, the collection "Soviet Rus'".
And the main success was at the end of June 1925, when the State Publishing House signed a contract with Yesenin for the publication of his works in three volumes.
None of the contemporary poets of Sergei Alexandrovich have been so honored, he is the first!
Moreover, it promised very good money - according to the contract, the fee was 1000 roubles per month for 20 months (the director of the plant, for example, received 300 roubles per month, and the engineer - 200).
Funds were needed that year more than ever.
Yesenin married the granddaughter of Leo Tolstoy, Sofia Tolstoy, and he needed to arrange family life, support his sisters, Katya and Sasha, and his mother.
It seemed that life was getting back on track, there was something to be happy about, but for him everything was predominantly in dark tones, as if the nightmare from the poem "Black Man" (written in November 1925 and published after the death of Yesenin) materialized:
My friend, my friend,
I'm very, very ill.
I don't know where this pain came from.
Either the wind is whistling
Over an empty and deserted field,
Is it like a forest in September,
Alcohol is a brain-destroyer.
Many acquaintances noted that Yesenin had lost a lot of weight, looked bad, and was clearly ill.
More and more, there are outbursts and nervous breakdowns.
And the reason is probably not just alcoholism...
However, if such a diagnosis - alcoholism - was made to Sergei Alexandrovich by someone, no reliable documents remain.
For example, those from May 1923, when Yesenin, at the insistence of his fourth wife, the American Isadora Duncan, was improving his health in a clinic near Paris under the care of Professor Peter Gannushkin (Yesenin will return to him two years later, already in Moscow).
But there is plenty of evidence of the poet's drinking sprees, scandals on this subject, and arrests - scattered throughout dozens of memoirs.
Since the early 20s, the poet's terrible romance with the green snake has been developing rapidly.
At the end of the summer of 1923, Yesenin lived for a short time with a friend, the imagist Ivan Starstsev.
It is surprising, but despite his very good income, Yesenin never had his own home in Moscow or in St. Petersburg; he lived in rented apartments, in hotels, or with acquaintances.
Starzhevsky recalls:
"He only came to sleep, and in most cases in an insane, drunken state.
One time, returning at four in the morning, Yesenin fell on the landing...
Falling, I scratched my face and wheezed.
After coming to, he began coughing incessantly, spraying the entire bed sheet with blood..."
And even Yesenin himself, after a trip to Europe and the United States (in the States there was a dry law at that time, but Duncan took a decent supply of alcohol with her), admitted:
"I saw nothing there, except for pigs and streets...
I stopped remembering people by the end of it...
Well, and he drank, of course...
And I drank because I was homesick."
Pirelli (Pirelli) Scorpion Winter 265/45 R20 108V tyre
The Pirelli Scorpion Winter winter tire, based on a high-strength rubber and silica mixture, provides long-term effective operation, even wear, and resistance to loads.
The linear pattern of the Pirelli Scorpion Winter tyre tread, which forms the ribs, guarantees low rolling resistance and directional stability.
Four deep grooves effectively remove water and dirt from the contact patch of the Pirelli Scorpion Winter tire, suppress sliding and aquaplaning.
The 3D-shaped lamellas increase grip on slippery roads, in snow and on ice.
The large shoulder blocks of the Pirelli Scorpion Winter increase the tire's lateral grip when cornering, increase traction, and reduce braking distance.
The small grooves and indentations help to dissipate the heat.
Promtex-Orient Duet Latex Econom 100x195 mattress
Promtex-Orient Duet Latex Econom is a modern version of the budget model in the premium class line.
The mattress is based on a block of independent double Duet springs.
A smaller, softer spring is inserted into the large spring.
This allows the load on the mattress to be evenly distributed.
The mattress is filled on both sides with a filler - artificial latex.
It is a substitute for natural latex, but it is denser and less expensive.
The flexibility and elasticity of this material increases the comfort effect of the mattress.
Synthetic latex is hypoallergenic, it does not absorb moisture or dust.
The mattress is ideal for a couple with a large weight difference (from 30 kilograms).
With the "smart" springs, there is no wave effect when the light partner slides to the side of the heavy one.
The pleasant, soft-to-the-touch Sense jacquard cover is lined with a layer of synthetic fibre.
Natural fabrics do not hold static electricity.
It is possible to make this mattress model in a rolled-up version (vacuum roll-packing).
Now his son is almost 16, and he hasn't been plagued by the desire to get high for a long time.
All of his energy is focused on choosing what he will do for a living.
He's a lot more responsible than I was at his age or my husband, who had run-ins with the law right up until the wedding.
The father is taking care of his young daughter.
And he loves, as Lermontov wrote, "with a strange love".
Why did the girl cry during the exam when she hadn't failed it yet?
Why didn't he tell his daughter that it wasn't a school.
Well, it will have a tail.
So what?
He will retake it.
This is known to millions of students.
What is it all about, anyway?
Poland's foreign ministry says Belarus is using migrants as 'weapon' against EU
Poland’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes that Belarus is using migrants as a “weapon”
The Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of Poland, Pawel Jablonski, expressed the opinion that the President of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko, used refugees as a “weapon” against the European Union and intends to return to such an “operation” next year.
The deputy head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs made a corresponding statement in an interview with the Australian Financial Review newspaper.
According to Yablonsky, the sanctions against Belarus have temporarily “stopped Lukashenko”, but he is “actively looking for new ways”.
The Polish official is also convinced that now illegal migrants will be used as a weapon "in many parts of the world".
As the kp.ru website wrote, earlier the European Union implemented the fifth package of sanctions against Belarus.
It affected 17 individuals and 11 organizations.
Europe has announced its readiness to further expand restrictive measures against the republic, “if the situation in the country does not improve”.
In response, Minsk imposed a food embargo on a wide range of goods from countries that had previously decided to impose sanctions against Belarus.

"Not for Senya's cap": when a velvet jacket makes a man a laughingstock
Velvet jackets dominated the 2021 social scene.
Perhaps the first to announce his new fashion choice was Daniel Craig.
Back in September, at the premiere of the film "No Time to Die," he appeared in a velvet magenta jacket and the traditional "Bond" bow tie.
Prince William followed in his footsteps twice, first wearing a green velvet jacket to the Earthshot Prize awards ceremony, which was not in keeping with the royal dress code, and then choosing a more classic option for an event in support of the Royal Variety charity.
A couple of weeks ago, Lionel Messi also joined the trend.
The footballer came to collect his seventh "Golden Ball" in a velvet Dolce & Gabbana jacket.
By the way, his sons were dressed in the same.
AliExpress is already seeing growing demand for velvet men's jackets in Russia.
According to the service’s analysts, according to Gazeta.Ru, they began to buy them 1.4 times more often.
The most popular are warm velvet jackets with a lining and a fitted silhouette, the main colors are dark beige, burgundy, dark blue and, of course, black.
The average price of such models is from 3 to 6 thousand rubles. At the same time, men prefer to buy only jackets - they choose velvet suits less often.
They can be purchased not only from online retailers.
Budget options are available at H&M, Mango, Next and Zara.
In the luxury segment, velvet jackets are being offered by almost all brands this season - from Brioni to Paul Smith, Etro and Saint Laurent.
The most desirable is the Gucci model, in which the brand ambassador Jared Leto appeared at one of the premieres of the film "House of Gucci".
When choosing jackets from expensive brands, you can be sure that the velvet is made from silk.
Thanks to a special method of interweaving the threads, a dense fabric with a fluffy outer texture and a smooth inner side is obtained.
The more budget options are made from cotton or polyamide, but as a result, they last less.
Lamoda fashion expert Ilya Vakhoshkin warns that in the case of a velvet jacket, the main thing is not its model or style, but its appropriateness.
"Velvet requires evening light, so such a jacket is ideal if you're going to a party or a formal event," explains Vakhoshin. "It will also be suitable for those occasions when the invitation specifies a "Black Tie" or "Creative Black Tie" dress code.
Another important criterion that allows you to make a choice in favor of a velvet jacket is the status of its buyer.
"A man in a velvet jacket, first of all, should get the right advanced group of people with wealth," the authors of the Telegram channel about men's fashion "Handsome Brummell" believe. "Owners of velvet jackets, as a rule, belong to the caste of those people who rarely buy tickets.
They are simply invited to the relevant social events, where there is always a dress code.
Ilya Vakhoskin suggests combining a velvet jacket with the same smart things: classic trousers with creases, plain shirts, silk ties, loafers with tassels, buttons.
Too simple and everyday things will look out of place.
The fashion experts from "Beau Brummell" are sure that it would be inappropriate for an ordinary employee to appear in a velvet jacket at a corporate event, but if we are talking about "a manager from among those who are in charge of this event, then - yes, such a thing is appropriate for him".
If the lower-ranking employee's goal is to move up in the company's complex hierarchy or win financial bonuses, it's better not to wear a velvet jacket.
Management will definitely appreciate the phrase “not a hat for Senya”, the editors of the Telegram channel about men’s fashion believe.
I have very mixed feelings about the voice.
It's an unnatural timbre, so strained.
And it has absolutely nothing to do with the sweet face of a young girl.
To be honest, I don't understand the admiration of those around me.
But from the bottom of my heart, I wish you good luck in life!
It all comes down to money - alternative energy is well lobbied, that is, it is paid for.
Billions of dollars of investment.
Are they sad?
No, the price of electricity has gone up.
Traditional energy is also not out of the question - both gas and oil and coal were bought cheaper than they are being sold now.
There is a wild demand for fuel.
A penny drips.
And who is in the gap then?
As usual, he was just a regular customer.
Don't the problems of the Indians touch the sheriff?
Therefore, one should not consider Western politicians idiots for "sleeping through" the energy crisis.
They did their job.
For a modest fee.
I didn't see any beautiful people in the photos in the article.
Just mediocrity within the average passenger.
Perhaps if such characters are so sure of their beauty that they decide to show it to the whole train, then they probably won't get on with such people.
But only because of the mental disorder and ignorance of such "beauties", but not because of their appearance.
Kazbek, "a slave who recognizes his slave status and fights against it, is a revolutionary.
The slave who is unaware of his slavery and wallows in a silent, unconscious, and wordless life of slavery is simply a slave.
A slave who drools when he self-righteously describes the pleasures of being a slave and praises his kind and good master is a lackey, a sycophant."
An immunologist stated that revaccination in 4-5 months will help protect against the "omicron" strain of the coronavirus
Revaccination four to five months later can protect against the new omicron strain of the coronavirus infection.
This statement was made by immunologist Nikolai Kryuchkov, who called the vaccination six months later, taking into account the appearance of a new strain, "a very long period"
"With the previous strains, such a period was normal, but now it is best to conduct the procedure after five months, and for people with chronic diseases - after four," the expert said, calling for revaccination to be carried out in parallel with the vaccination campaign.
Kruchkov also noted that early revaccination provides a good titer of neutralizing antibodies.
“If a person has had two vaccinations and a booster, or has recovered and been vaccinated, or has been vaccinated and recovered, then they have ‘hybrid immunity’, that is, they have a lot of antibodies and enough neutralising ones”, the expert clarified.
G7 warns Russia of 'massive consequences' if it invades Ukraine
The G7 countries (the United Kingdom, Germany, Italy, Canada, the United States, France and Japan) have published a statement following the meeting of foreign ministers in Liverpool.
It emphasizes that "military aggression" by Russia against Ukraine "will have huge consequences and will be very expensive" for Moscow, but specific measures are not described in the document.
"We, the Foreign Ministers of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States of America and the High Representative of the European Union, are united in our condemnation of Russia's military build-up and aggressive rhetoric against Ukraine," the statement said.
Next, the ministers call on Russia to "de-escalate, use diplomatic channels and respect its international commitments on military transparency," as US President Biden said during a video call with Russian President Putin on December 7.
"We reaffirm our support for the efforts of France and Germany in the Normandy format to achieve full implementation of the Minsk agreements in order to resolve the conflict in eastern Ukraine," the G7 foreign ministers also said.
Any use of force to change borders is strictly prohibited by international law.
Russia should have no doubt that further military aggression against Ukraine will have massive consequences and severe costs," they warn.
We reaffirm our unwavering commitment to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, and the right of any sovereign state to determine its own future.
We welcome Ukraine's restrained position.
We will intensify our cooperation on our common and comprehensive response," the statement added.
Earlier in the day, British Foreign Secretary Elizabeth Truss said that Russia would face "serious consequences" in the event of an invasion of Ukraine.
She said the meeting showed a "united voice of the G7 countries, which account for 50% of the world's GDP, and which have made it very clear that an invasion of Ukraine would have huge consequences for Russia".
Pfizer vaccine found to be 32 times less effective against omicron variant
The effectiveness of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine against the omicron variant of the coronavirus is 32 times lower than against other types of the disease.
This conclusion was reached by scientists from the University of Hong Kong and the Chinese University of Hong Kong, reports South China Morning Post (SCMP).
The vaccine was found to be less effective based on a study of the antiviral activity in people who received two doses of the COVID-19 drug.
"We see that most people had a high level of antiviral activity against the original variant of Sars-CoV-2, however this ability was significantly reduced against the Omicron variant," Professor Malik Peiris explained.
At the same time, the scientists emphasized that vaccination remains the most reliable way to protect against a severe course of the disease when infected with the coronavirus.
Earlier, scientists from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine predicted the development of the coronavirus pandemic, taking into account the influence of the omicron strain on it.
The authors of the study concluded that the omicron variant could cause a new wave of virus circulation and an increase in mortality if additional measures are not taken.
Ukraine’s defense minister accused Germany of blocking the delivery of NATO weapons to Kiev
The head of the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense, Aleksey Reznikov, accused the government of former German Chancellor Angela Merkel of blocking Kiev's acquisition of deadly weapons within NATO.
In an interview with the Financial Times on December 12, Reznikov recalled that last month Germany vetoed the purchase of anti-sniper systems and rifles for shooting down drones by Ukraine.
At the same time, it is noted that later Berlin softened its position on rifles, recognizing them as non-lethal weapons.
According to the defense minister, Kiev intends to acquire the aforementioned weapons within the framework of bilateral agreements with allies.
In particular, this includes the United States, the United Kingdom, Lithuania, and France.
Meanwhile, the FT notes that the position of the new German government led by Chancellor Olaf Scholz on the issue of arms deliveries to Ukraine remains unclear.
Earlier on Sunday, the Ukrainian ambassador to Germany, Andrey Melnik, expressed the opinion that Kiev should not expect Berlin to supply weapons with Chancellor Scholz.
According to him, the previous German leadership explained its refusal to provide weapons by the risk of military escalation of the conflict in Donbass, despite the "occupation of Russia" of part of the Ukrainian territory.
The diplomat is sure that Germany will maintain the same "illogical" position with the new chancellor.
In August, Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky said Kiev was expecting assistance from Berlin in equipping the naval fleet.
Ukraine is counting on Germany to “be a partner of Ukraine in a technical sense”, the president added.
It was also noted that in the spring of this year, the co-chairman of the German Green Party, Robert Habeck, visited the republic, where he spoke in favor of selling defensive weapons to Kiev.

I feel sorry for her, she has lived her life in anger.

G7 warns Russia of accountability for Ukraine invasion
Foreign ministers of the G7 warned of "serious consequences" for Russia if it continues military aggression against Ukraine, according to a final statement by the parties.
The participants of the meeting also noted that they condemn the strengthening of Russian armed forces at the country's borders.
"Russia should have no doubt that further military aggression against Ukraine would have massive consequences and severe costs in response," the statement said, published on the UK government website.
The G7 ministers and the EU High Representative noted that they are "united in their condemnation of the Russian military build-up and aggressive rhetoric against Ukraine."
British Foreign Secretary Elizabeth Truss warned of "serious consequences" for Russia in the event of an invasion of Ukraine at a press conference in Liverpool.
We have made it clear that any invasion will have massive consequences...
The G7 wants Russia to stop its aggression against Ukraine," she said (quoted by TASS).
Earlier, at the Liverpool summit, G7 foreign ministers agreed that in order to resolve the crisis over the build-up of Russian troops on the border with Ukraine, the parties needed to return to the negotiating table.
This was about negotiations in the “Normandy format”.
The North Atlantic Alliance has also called for a dialogue on Ukraine in the “Normandy format”.
Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said that by calling for Russia and Ukraine to return to the negotiating table, the G7 countries "signed up to their inability to take responsibility for their own mistakes."

Methods of returning money stolen through online stores revealed
There are several ways to get your money back from online stores and not become a victim of fraud in the future.
This was revealed by information security experts in a conversation with RBC.
For example, to reduce the risk of large losses when bank card data falls into the hands of criminals, it is recommended to keep the main funds on a card or bank account that is not used for online shopping.
Part of the savings can be put into a savings account and withdrawn as needed.
Experts also recommend getting a separate card for online purchases.
If the money was stolen while shopping at a store that doesn't use the 3D Secure security technology, you can start a refund procedure.
"According to the rules established by payment systems, in the case of unauthorized transactions carried out without the use of 3D Secure, responsibility is placed on the participant in the payment chain who does not use this service," clarified a representative of Promsvyazbank.
An expert from the international payment provider Ecommpay, Artur Zaremba, emphasized that the buyer has the right to submit an application to the bank to dispute a fraudulent operation no later than 120 days after the purchase.
In addition, if the criminal used the card on online resources that do not require two-factor authentication, the transaction can be disputed and the money returned.
It is noted that in some cases, online stores themselves will return the money to the customer if the order has not yet been sent for delivery.
On November 19, a member of the Public Chamber, director of the League for a Safe Internet, Ekaterina Mizulina, reported that in 2021 alone, 11 thousand complaints were received for various cases of fraud: from the sale of fake documents to the theft of personal data.
According to her, an effective solution in the current circumstances may be the creation of a single window for complaints about online fraudsters.
Scholz arrived in Poland to discuss "Nord Stream 2" and EU legislation
Newly elected German Chancellor Olaf Scholz arrived in Warsaw for talks on the migrant crisis on the border with Belarus, the independence of the judiciary in Poland, the build-up of Russian troops near the borders of Ukraine and the situation with the Russian Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline.
While Scholz has spoken of his desire to maintain good relations between Germany and Poland for years to come, the leaders of the two countries have expressed unambiguous expectations of each other.
Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said he would call on Scholz to oppose the "Nord Stream 2" pipeline, which is expected to deliver Russian gas to Germany bypassing Ukraine.
According to Morawiecki, Russia can use the gas pipeline against Europe as a means of political pressure.
In turn, Germany supported Poland's efforts to stop the flow of migrants trying to enter the country from Belarus.
Berlin has stated that it will help Warsaw and Brussels to resolve this crisis.
Poland's judicial system, however, remains one of the reasons for disagreement.
The European Court of Justice has fined Poland, finding that judicial reforms carried out by the right-wing Law and Justice party violate EU law.
Poland refused to pay the fine and its highest court ruled that national law takes precedence over EU rules.
The new German government, sworn in on Wednesday, despite demands from Poland and the United States, has not publicly committed to stopping the operation of Nord Stream 2 in the event of a Russian invasion of Ukraine.
U.S. officials have told members of Congress that they have reached an understanding with Germany to halt the Nord Stream 2 pipeline if Russia invades Ukraine, a senior U.S. congressional official said on Tuesday.
German officials have not confirmed the reports, but Scholz warned of consequences if Russia crossed Ukraine's borders on Wednesday, and this position was confirmed by G7 representatives on Sunday.
Dmitry, pay closer attention.
The view outside the window is the same, and the size of the window has not changed.
The wall between the kitchen and the room was removed, so the second window is partially visible.
But in general, those who are not familiar with the original plan are in doubt.
And I know such apartments very well and I can see very well how it was re-planned.
Let everything be well with them.
It always surprises me when they write about means to clean sinks, toilets, window sills, and taps.
You wash them once a year on Easter, or something like that, and you have to scrub them.
Just don't get dirty.
The Ministry of Digital Development wants to give writers residencies
The future Fund for the Support of Russian Writers will receive federal property that was left as an inheritance from the Union of Writers of the USSR and the Literary Fund of the USSR.
On its basis, writers’ residencies will be created, the Ministry of Digital Development, Communications and Mass Media told Parlamentskaya Gazeta, which will become the founder of the fund.
The Ministry of Digital Development is preparing a draft presidential decree on the creation of a fund to support Russian writers.
The explanatory note clarifies that the fund will be tasked with taking care of the targeted use and preservation of buildings and structures that once belonged to the Soviet Union of Writers and Litfond.
“A significant number of real estate objects that previously belonged to the Literary Fund of the USSR have passed into the property of the Russian Federation, including objects located in the village of Peredelkino, the village of Komarovo in the Leningrad region, and others”, the press service of the Ministry of Digital Development, Communications and Mass Media told Parlamentskaya Gazeta.
The draft decree prescribes to reflect in the charter of the Foundation that it "is created in order to promote literary activity by creating the necessary conditions for the creative work of writers".
“By ‘creating conditions for creative activity’, it is meant creating writer’s residencies on the basis of the transferred property in different regions of Russia, where there would be comfortable conditions for creativity”, the Ministry of Digital Development explained to our publication.

Doctors warn of risks of long-term use of blood thinners after COVID-19, before vaccination
Doctors Irina Yartsova and Sergey Tokarev warned of the danger of uncontrolled use of blood thinners after contracting the COVID-19 coronavirus infection and before vaccination against the coronavirus.
The physician-therapist and immunologist, Irina Yartsova, said that independent prevention of the possible formation of blood clots after COVID-19 can provoke a stroke.
Yartseva explained that blood thinners are not prescribed to everyone, only if the patient was hospitalized, was in the hospital, and had complications.
A doctor will prescribe anticoagulants (blood thinners that prevent excessive blood clotting) as indicated.
She reported that there is currently a state of ignorance - everyone is taking anticoagulants for a long time and is getting complications in the form of hemorrhagic strokes (bleeding in the brain) as a result.
The chief prophylactologist of the Urals Federal District, the scientific director of the Society of Specialists in Preventive Medicine, Doctor of Medical Sciences Sergey Tokarev, told URA.RU in an interview that Russians now often use anticoagulants and before vaccination against the coronavirus infection.
According to Dr. Tokarev, citizens believe dubious advice on the Internet and start self-medicating.
There are citizens who, of their own volition, start taking anticoagulants a week before vaccination.
And at the preliminary examination before the vaccination, doctors notice bruises.
He stressed that it is extremely dangerous to take any medication without finding out the cause of any symptom.
Potatoes have been named a superfood for protecting against hypertension

She was left extremely dissatisfied because there was no "fancy" kitchen and "fancy" balcony.
The aunt, apparently, has nothing to do, so she is looking at other people's apartments, and people are wasting their time.

The plumber who found money in the wall of the church will receive $20,000
The plumber who found the money in the wall of the church in the American state of Texas will receive a reward.
This is reported in a press release from the non-profit organization Crime Stoppers of Houston.
The incident happened at a large evangelical church in Lakewood, where Pastor Joel Austin preaches a message of wealth and prosperity for the faithful.
In November 2021, plumber Justin Cowley was repairing one of the church's toilets and found, under the insulation, thousands of packets of money and checks.
He gave the find to the church and, he says, he didn't even get a thank you from Austin.
"I wanted to hear him say, "You know, Justin, you did the right thing.
We understand what you did and what you could have done," KPRC-TV quoted him as saying.
The find appears to be related to a theft that occurred at the Lakewood Church seven years ago.
At that time, about $200,000 in cash and $400,000 in checks, which were stored in the church's safe, were stolen.
The money was insured, so the church did not suffer a loss.
However, a $25,000 reward was offered for information about the perpetrators.
Justin Cooley was not eligible for the amount as the award had already expired.
Despite this, the non-profit organization Crime Stoppers of Houston, which at one time awarded five thousand dollars for the reward and later received another twenty thousand dollars as a gift from the Lakewood Church, decided to reward the plumber's honesty.
He will receive $20,000.
Earlier, it was reported that the police questioned pastor Joel Austin about the money found in the wall of the Lakewood church.
Tanya, her words, her actions - this is her characteristic as a "real person".
That is why the attitude towards it is so negative.
And it's not because "she's financially significantly richer than all the writers," as they write here.
There are people who are richer, but not all of them behave so brazenly, so provocatively, as this lady.

New case of human infection with bird flu virus recorded in China
A new case of a human infection with a highly pathogenic avian influenza virus of the H5N6 type has been recorded in China.
The RTHK radio station reported this, citing a notification from the Hong Kong health authorities, TASS reports.
A 68-year-old resident of Huizhou District in southern Guangdong Province was infected with the disease, who kept poultry at home.
His condition is described by medics as critical.
The world's first human infection with the H5N6 strain of the virus was recorded in May 2014 in the southwestern province of Sichuan.
Since then, the number of such cases in the country has reached 53.
Brazil has made it mandatory for citizens to present vaccination passports when entering the country
In Brazil, they have made it mandatory to require covid-passports from those entering the country. The corresponding decision was made by the Federal Supreme Court of Brazil (STF) judge Luis Roberto Barroso.
CNN Brasil reports this.
Citizens with contraindications to vaccination are exempt from presenting a vaccination certificate.
Persons arriving from countries where the vaccine has been proven to be absent are also included in the list of exceptions.
"The situation is even more serious if we consider that Brazil is a popular tourist destination for New Year's Eve, pre-Carnival and Carnival parties, as well as other events, which suggests an increase in tourist flow," noted Barroso.
Earlier, the Brazilian authorities obliged unvaccinated tourists to observe a five-day quarantine.
A scheme for full protection against COVID-19 has been revealed
The virologist, Doctor of Medical Sciences, Honored Scientist of Russia Anatoly Altstein, in conversation with Ura.ru, revealed the scheme for complete protection from the coronavirus infection.
According to him, this can be achieved by means of an injection and the use of a nasal vaccine.
When administered intranasally, large amounts of IgA are produced. This does not happen when the vaccine is injected.
IgA protects the mucous membrane, so the virus cannot get into the body.
And inside, after vaccination, we produce the most G immunoglobulins (antibodies).
And if you give both vaccines, you will get a lot of IgA and IgG. But there is no decision yet on double vaccination," the medic said.
The chief prophylactician of the Urals Federal District, Doctor of Medical Sciences Sergey Tokarev, in turn, stated that the main advantage of using nasal vaccination in conjunction with injection is the ability to stop being a carrier of COVID-19.
He added that this would help as the body's defences would then, presumably, be at their maximum.
Earlier, the Minister of Health of Nizhny Novgorod Region, David Melik-Guseinov, stated that the spread of the new coronavirus infection among children would lead to a new outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic.
According to him, this is exactly what is happening in other countries, where the next wave of the pandemic came earlier.
Inna, hmm...
I talked to the stud (he died a long time ago) like this - if you're ready to exchange a warm home, food, affection, love and games for a wet bitch, then go ahead.
But Pesel was trained and was a smart guy in general.
I chose my company and went home.
The video shows a method that works in 90% of cases.
It's not made up, believe me.
I stopped many owners from running after the dog, although they said that 200,000 were running away (pooches), I took them by the hand and led them in the other direction.
In the end, the "200 thousand" chose the owner, and not the dog, which was running somewhere there.
Mass protests against vaccination continue in Europe
More than forty thousand protesters took to the streets in the Austrian capital of Vienna.
They expressed dissatisfaction with the restrictive measures and the authorities' plans to make vaccination against COVID-19 mandatory.
From February next year, unvaccinated people will have to pay a fine of 3600 euros.
Spaniards outraged by the government's health policy held a peaceful march in Madrid.
Some held placards reading "This is a fake pandemic," "I will not be vaccinated."
A large protest against sanitary passports took place in Barcelona, the capital of Catalonia.
In the autonomous community, the Covid certificate is mandatory for access to bars, restaurants, gyms, nursing homes and nightclubs.
The decision to introduce sanitary passports was taken by the authorities of a number of regions of the country against the backdrop of an increase in the number of cases of coronavirus infection.
In Luxembourg, more than a thousand protesters demonstrated against the tightening of restrictions and QR codes.
The demonstration started peacefully but then escalated into clashes with the police.
A group of protesters began throwing stones at the police.
In response, law enforcement officers used water cannons.
Nikolay S., even in Wikipedia there is no consensus on this matter.
Kashevarova-Rudneva is also designated as "the first Russian doctor, doctor of medicine", probably because she began her studies earlier.
Let's just not argue, I think they both deserve the title.
The only thing I agree with Zakharova on is that the Americans only brought death and looting to any country they appeared in.

The WHO has already detected “omicron” in more than sixty countries
The World Health Organization (WHO) has announced that the new coronavirus strain "omicron" has already been detected in 63 countries.
A number of experts are already saying that the spread of the new strain could have catastrophic consequences.
The WHO reported on the rate of spread of the strain.
According to the organization's data as of 9 December, the strain has already been detected in 63 countries, in all six WHO regions.
This is despite the fact that it has only been actively spreading since the end of November.
The WHO is also concerned about the rapid spread of the new coronavirus variant.
WHO experts are concerned that the new strain, according to preliminary data, may be more widespread than the "delta" strain, also known as the Indian variant of the coronavirus, which is currently leading in all countries without exception.
Prior to this, the Director-General of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, stated that the omicron strain is capable of having a significant impact on the course of the coronavirus pandemic.
The UK has also come to a similar conclusion.
Experts from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) believe that "omicron" will displace "delta" in the coming months.
And the number of people infected in Britain alone will be about 1 million. This is despite the fact that officially "omicron" is currently infecting several hundred people in the Kingdom, and according to estimates, up to 10,000.
British experts predict tens of thousands of deaths from the "omicron" strain, and at the peak, more than 2,000 people will be taken to hospital every day.
Something that the British healthcare system will not be able to cope with.
The situation is complicated by the fact that according to the latest research, the effectiveness of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine against the "omicron" strain is 32 times lower in comparison with other types of the disease.
It is not yet known how the Russian Sputnik V will react to “omicron” – this will become clear in the next few weeks.
The Gamaleya Center has just begun testing the Russian vaccine on the Omicron strain.

Our St. Petersburg, or rather Leningrad, communal apartment on Bolshaya Zelenina is still in touch.
Of course, we are not the closest of friends, but we try to maintain the warmth of the older generation.
Perhaps this is due to the fact that there were no visitors in the apartment, the rooms were not rented out, and the blockade brotherhood was not cancelled.
Unfortunately, we see each other more often at funerals.

Israel's Ministry of Health began an emergency program to increase vaccinations on Sunday.
From the morning of December 12, vaccination against the coronavirus is being carried out in schools throughout Israel.
The prime minister of the Jewish state, Naftali Bennett, said at today's cabinet meeting that the issue of vaccinating citizens at risk with a fourth dose will also be studied.
In Israel, mass vaccination of the population against the COVID-19 coronavirus infection began on 20 December 2020.
Israelis are being vaccinated with the Pfizer drug.

Seven people died in Brazil as a result of the rains
At least seven people have died and 175 have been injured as a result of heavy rains that have hit the northeastern Brazilian state of Bahia and neighboring Minas Gerais.
This is reported by TASS, citing emergency services.
An extratropical cyclone has been raging in the border region of these states since the middle of the week, causing the amount of precipitation in the region to reach 450 mm. A state of emergency has been declared in 25 municipalities of the state of Bahia, and in some of them, the floods have been the most destructive in 35 years.
Several bridges, two river dams and three roads have been destroyed by the element.
According to the rescuers, about 5,700 people were left homeless, and another 6,700 were forced to leave their homes.
The damage caused by the natural disaster affected more than 85,000 residents of the region.

$135 billion went to apps - Hi-Tech
In 2021, user spending in apps grew by 25% worldwide, and the number of downloads - by 8%.
The most popular services in the world turned out to be various video services.
The most downloaded app was the video editor CapCut, and the most money was spent on YouTube.
Both the number of app downloads and user spending in them showed a significant increase in the period from January to November 2021.
The number of downloads increased by 8%, reaching 140 billion. User spending in apps increased even more significantly, by 25%, to a record $135 billion.
Such data was published by the analytical company App Annie, which presented a report on the mobile application market in 2021.
In 2021, the global economy emerged from the lockdown and began the post-pandemic recovery.
"Will such a "return to the physical" slow down the growth of the app economy? Not at all," the report's authors believe.
India is the leader in the number of app downloads: it accounts for about 20% of all downloads.
The United States (9%) and Brazil (8%) follow.
As before, iOS gadget users spent more than Android users: iOS accounted for 65% of all app spending.
Among the applications, the video editor CapCut took first place in terms of the number of downloads in 2021.
It is followed by two Indian apps: video service MX TakaTak and online shopping app Meesho.
Telegram is also in the top 10 for the number of downloads.
Overall, if we judge by the number of downloads, VPN services (two of them are in the top 10 - VPN Master and NightOwl VPN) and services related to the creation and broadcasting of videos (in addition to CapCut and MX TakaTak, two more such services are in the top 10 - Moj and SnackVideo) are popular among users.
"Users spent the most on live streaming and online streaming apps," the report's authors note.
YouTube is in the lead here, and the top 5 for user spending also includes the video service TikTok, the streaming video services Disney+ and HBO Max, and the Japanese manga subscription service Piccoma.
Telegram, Instagram, Zoom and TikTok are in the top five in terms of the number of monthly active users, with the mobile version of Microsoft Office in fifth place.
In Russia, the shopping app AliExpress was the leader in the number of downloads per year.
It is followed by the Zenly service, which shows the location of friends, and the same CapCut.
Also in the top 10 apps are: online karaoke StarMaker, online clothing retailer Shein, Maps for Minecraft PE app, online taxi ordering service DiDi, Pure Tuber YouTube client, Dixy retailer app and Samokat online store.
People around the world have adapted to the pandemic through a shift to mobile life, which can be called one of the main conclusions.
The most successful industries were those that helped people be closer to each other, both virtually and in person," said Lexi Sydow, head of marketing research at App Annie, commenting on the results of the report.
The mobile games sector's revenue in 2021 reached $90 billion. The leaders in terms of downloads were casual and hyper-casual games, which have no or almost no plot, and the video design is minimal.
Count Masters, Project Makeover and Bridge Race made it into the top 3 most popular games in the world.
In Russia, the leading games are DOP 2: Delete One Part, Going Balls and Phone Case DIY.
Earlier, App Annie presented its forecast for 2022.
Among the main trends for the next year, the company's analysts named the growth in the number of TikTok users to 1.5 billion, the growth in popularity among Generation Z of financial applications, for example, the Robinhood investor application, as well as the further increase in the popularity of metaverse mobile games.

Russians warned of new fraud scheme
The perpetrators have begun to look for new tricks for fraud in video messages.
Izvestia writes about this, citing experts.
According to Ivideon's Director of Products, Zaur Abutalimov, the main danger associated with the spread of video communication tools is deepfakes.
In this case, the scammers create a fake video based on real footage involving the victim.
This allows the neural network to accurately reproduce the features of the behavior of a particular person.
Abutalibov added that with the help of deepfake, attackers can call a victim's acquaintance via video call or create a video with a copy of a person to send for the purpose of blackmail.
"Such fakes can easily provoke bullying, since a savvy perpetrator can place people in ridiculous, dangerous or compromising pseudo-scenarios," the expert said.
Varonis senior systems engineer Alexander Vetkol, in turn, noted that people psychologically trust others more when they see them.
He stressed that this can create specific risks in the case of technologies using video.
David, I'll add.
In what I wrote above, I emphasized that I bought all this in a small town, where the local mentality did not allow for a lot of makeup and walking in short skirts, showing stockings and tights on the legs.
It's a province, but the store USED to have that item.
In big cities, Muslim women painted their faces and showed their legs.
And it's the same in Dushanbe, it's a big city, the capital of the republic.
There are many fashionistas, but there is no same cosmetics.
Five actions to help prevent diabetes listed
Problems with blood sugar are some of the most common in the world.
However, some don't give it much thought, and that's a mistake.
Diabetes can lead to serious complications and even death over time.
Preventive measures play a major role in preventing the formation of diseases.
For example, doctors recommend changing the drinking regime - reducing the amount of various drinks and switching to plain water has a positive effect on metabolism.
Sweet foods raise blood sugar to dangerous levels when consumed in excess.
Therefore, the first step towards a healthy lifestyle is to stop buying sweets and keep them at home.
The appearance of the disease is not only affected by an improper diet, but also by habits.
To reduce the risk of diabetes, you need to move a lot.
Experts advise following a low-carb diet.
Such a diet will not only help you lose weight, but will also protect you from sharp fluctuations in blood sugar levels.
To protect against getting diabetes, you need to eat a lot of fiber.
Dietary fibre fills the stomach and thus promotes the feeling of satiety, the release of digestive juices and the absorption of food.

Dr. Pavlov spoke about the "weekend migraine" of workaholics
Several factors can lead to a worsening of health over the weekend
The reason for the deterioration of health after working days is often "weekend migraine", explained the well-known endocrinologist, candidate of medical sciences, senior research fellow of the Faculty of Fundamental Medicine of Moscow State University, scientific director of the Systemic Medicine Clinic, Zuhra Pavlova in her Telegram channel.
According to her, workaholics are especially prone to this, who experience headaches, fatigue and weakness on weekends.
Dr. Pavlov noted that in addition to the fatigue accumulated during the week, there are many objective reasons for the body's negative reaction to a change in conditions.
On the weekend, our lives change dramatically.
"We sleep for a long time, lie on the couch all day, probably eat more, and drink less," the doctor argued. "Because of the lack of coffee, a small withdrawal begins.
Overeating and lack of water cause heaviness and fatigue."
The late rise plays an additional role.
For example, if you get up three hours later than usual, you will experience a reaction known as jet lag.
It occurs in travelers who cross multiple time zones.
To determine which of the factors is playing a decisive role in the deterioration of well-being, Pavlova recommended tracking what changes the most on the weekends.

South African scientists say Pfizer vaccine ineffective against 'Omicron'
South Africa says Pfizer vaccine ineffective against ‘Omicron’
South African scientists conducted a study and reported low effectiveness of the Pfizer vaccine against the omicron strain of the coronavirus infection.
It is estimated that (the level of neutralization of "omicron") corresponds to (the level of) vaccine effectiveness of 22.5% against symptomatic infection, which... casts doubt on the ability of the vaccine to protect against infection, according to the study published on the MedRxiv portal.
At the same time, experts clarified that the drug can save from a severe course of the disease.
Earlier, the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine predicted that the omicron strain of the coronavirus could cause a new wave of the pandemic in the UK with more frequent hospitalizations than a year ago.
How much hidden sugar is in common foods?
Sugar is not the best source of beneficial nutrients.
Its excess in the diet can lead to type 2 diabetes, as well as cardiovascular and cancer diseases.
Consumers should be aware that an unfamiliar word in a product's ingredients list may be a hidden sugar - an ingredient that is similar to sugar in terms of calories, composition and glycemic index.
The label may list dozens of names, essentially meaning sugar.
Some of the most common and frequently encountered names are glucose and fructose.
There may also be other extracted sugars such as dextrose (sugar from corn), levulose (fruit sugar), molasses (black treacle), agave syrup, etc.
These are all simple carbohydrates that fall into the category of monosaccharides and disaccharides, and they can be found not only in sweets, but also in ketchup, hot dogs, bread, and so on.
According to Rospotrebnazor, the most effective way to reduce sugar consumption is to eat whole and unprocessed foods, and to pay attention to the label and the many different names for sugar.
Different types of sugar taste different, but no matter what the ingredient is called in a product - syrup or nectar, processed or unprocessed, brown or white - it's still sugar.
It's not easy to calculate the exact amount of sugar, since you have to take into account not only the amount of sugar indicated by the manufacturer on the package, but also the fact that vegetables, fruits, etc. originally contain a certain amount of sugar.
Therefore, the total amount of sugar can be significantly higher than what is listed on the label.
German Chancellor Scholz: Gas will lose importance for Germany in 25 years
Germany's new chancellor Olaf Scholz said that gas imports are losing importance for Germany as the country continues its transition to a decarbonized economy.
According to him, Germany plans to completely abandon gas, oil and coal by 2045, becoming a climate-neutral country.
"That is to say, in 25 years, the world will be such that the issue of transporting gas to Germany and Europe will play a different role," the chancellor said.
Scholz noted that Germany continues to remain committed to Ukraine transporting Russian natural gas in the future, as this resource is currently important for the energy transition.
He recalled that Germany and the United States made a statement in which Berlin's support for Ukraine's energy transformation was recorded.
Earlier, German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock stated that the certification process for the Nord Stream 2 pipeline is ongoing.
According to the minister, within the framework of the coalition negotiations and the discussion of the coalition agreement, it was stated that European energy law should be applied to energy projects.
The diplomat also pointed out that the pipeline "does not yet meet the requirements" of the European Union.

Hackers break into Twitter account of Indian PM
Hackers have broken into the Twitter account of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
The perpetrators managed to publish a fake message.
It was reported that India had allegedly recognized bitcoin as a legal means of payment, and that the country had already purchased the cryptocurrency.
Modi's office asked for the new messages to be ignored.
Representatives of the prime minister said that Twitter responded quickly - access to the account was restored.
The Prime Minister of India's website was hacked in 2020 and called for donations to the fund using cryptocurrency.
In a referendum in New Caledonia, the majority voted against independence
The third referendum in New Caledonia, held on 12 December, ended with the same result as the previous two.
According to the first partial results announced on Sunday, December 12 at noon, most New Caledonians voted in the referendum against the independence of their territory.
At the same time, the level of participation in this third vote was significantly lower than in the previous two.
According to preliminary results published by local authorities, 3.51% (2,755 people) voted in favor of New Caledonia's independence from France, while 96.49% (75,762) voted "against".
The turnout was 43.90%, with more than 80,000 New Caledonians taking part in the election.
As the Agence France-Presse agency commented on these interim results, "the outcome of these elections left no room for doubt", as the independence supporters called on voters not to participate in the vote.
As the initiators of the referendum, they opposed its holding on December 12, considering that the new outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic on the archipelago prevents a full and "honest" election campaign.
Thus, this abstention paved the way for a third victory for the supporters of French New Caledonia, after the referendums held in November 2018 and in October 2020.
In 2018, 56.7% of residents voted against independence, in 2020 - 53.3%.
The separatists say they do not recognize the results of the latest vote and will challenge them at the United Nations.
As reported on Sunday, December 12, at the Elysée Palace, French President Emmanuel Macron is due to speak on the results of this referendum.
The issue of New Caledonia's independence has been a major talking point in the final weeks of the French presidential campaign.
Several presidential candidates have argued that the territory should remain part of France because it is "the last European Union presence in the Pacific."
"New Caledonia must necessarily remain French," Eric Zemmour repeated.
The same statement was made by the Republican candidate Valerie Pecresse, who published a column in Le Figaro at the end of October, calling on the Caledonians to remain French.
For his part, Emmanuel Macron announced in May 2018 that he would not take a position "because it is not his responsibility".
However, the president added: "France would be less beautiful without New Caledonia."
Prime Minister Jean Castex, for his part, expressed "a strong desire for the choice of the Caledonians to be the choice of France".

Turkey has successfully tested the world's first drone with a laser weapon.
The Eren UAV was tested at a distance of 100 to 500 meters, reports MIR24.
The device is capable of neutralising explosive objects at a distance using a laser.
The maximum flight height of the new model reaches 3,000 m.
After passing the necessary tests, the drone will be put into service by the Turkish military, which will use it to destroy explosive devices without the involvement of sappers.
The agency emphasizes that Turkey is among the six countries in the world capable of developing and producing its own drones.

WSJ readers criticize article on Russia-U.S. ties
Readers of The Wall Street Journal have criticized an article by Professor Christopher Hartwell, in which he described his vision of relations between Russia and the United States.
The author of the material expressed concern that the West is allegedly sacrificing Ukraine to Russia.
In his article, he convinced readers of the danger emanating from Moscow, and made a number of insulting remarks about Russian President Vladimir Putin.
At the end, Hartwell called on western countries to "stand as one against Russia".
Readers of the WSJ expressed their disagreement with the American professor's position.
"There is a lot of false information in this article," RIA Novosti quotes one of the readers as saying.
"Europe is not ours to "lose," and Ukraine is not our land.
The U.S. and NATO allies will never engage in a nuclear war with Russia over Ukraine," another noted.
Patches can also be applied to the lip area.
The Dearboo Peach & Hibiscus Brightening Hydrogel Eye Patch used in the production of the patches is a high-tech polymer that provides increased absorption and transfer of highly concentrated natural plant essence to the skin, tightly adheres to the skin and gives a feeling of freshness.
When delivering nutrients to the skin, the hydrogel minimises the associated loss of moisture and causes the essence to penetrate the deeper layers of the skin.

A 5.2 magnitude earthquake occurred in the Kuril Islands region
A 5.2 magnitude earthquake occurred near the Kuril island of Shikotan.
It is noted that the epicenter of the earthquake was 231.8 km northeast of the city of Severo-Kurilsk.
The epicenter was at a depth of 92.5 km.
Earlier, seismologists recorded a 7.5 magnitude earthquake in Peru, during which ten people were injured.

Ukraine will begin to produce new generation jet drones
A new Ukrainian-Turkish plant will begin to create jet unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) of the ANKA type.
This was reported by the non-staff advisor to the head of the Ukrainian president's office, Aleksey Arestovich, on December 11.
That is, they are capable of acting against air targets, against other drones.
Even against piloted aircraft.
They will have Ukrainian engines and the rest of the Turkish avionics: the body and so on," Dialog.ua quotes him as saying.
Commenting on the main features of the ANKA drones, Arestovich said that we are talking about jet, and not piston, drones.
According to him, this is a new generation of drones after the Bayraktar, which exceeds it "in all characteristics".
The first batch of drones should be produced by the plant at the end of next year, concluded Arestovich.
The ANKA aircraft was created by the Turkish Space Agency in February 2014.
The development of the drone was carried out by the Turkish authorities in cooperation with a number of private companies since 2010.
The day before, the Ukrainian General Staff classified data on the use of Bayraktar drones and Javelin missile systems during military operations of the united forces in Donbas.
On December 6, the President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky, announced that the construction of a factory for the production of modern military drones had begun in the country.
According to him, Ukraine is determined to use drones.
On September 29, the Bayraktar Savunma company and the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense signed an agreement on the construction of a center in the Kiev region, where personnel will be trained, as well as tests and maintenance of the Turkish Bayraktar UAVs.
The press service of the office of the Ukrainian leader called this memorandum "a big real step forward".
Two lions escaped from a container at the airport
Lions have escaped at Singapore's Changi Airport.
The Straits Times reports this.
Two predators managed to escape from a container with seven lions, which arrived on one of the planes.
The publication notes that it remains unknown from which country they were brought to Singapore, and where they were headed.
One of the escaped lions lay down on the roof of a container.
The animals could not get away from it because of the protective net installed nearby.
The standoff ended after the arrival at the airport of staff from the Mandai Wildlife Group, which oversees all of Singapore's zoos.
They have immobilized the lions with tranquilizer darts and plan to transport them to a quarantine facility.
Earlier it was reported that in Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia, a lion escaped from its owner and wandered the streets of the city.
On the same day, the animal voluntarily returned home, and no people were hurt.
Experts warn of cancer risk from B9 vitamin
Research suggests that an excess of vitamin B9, also known as folic acid, can lead to cancer.
The Daily Express warned of this.
According to experts, there is strong evidence that people who do not have a deficiency of folic acid are less likely to develop certain types of cancer, in particular colorectal cancer.
However, exceeding the necessary dose, on the contrary, promotes the growth of cancer cells.
Professor Beth Kitchin, a dietitian at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, advises to keep track of the amount of folic acid consumed throughout the day.
The optimal dose is 400 micrograms per day.
The risk of cancer only increases if you deviate significantly from this number in either direction.
Kitchin recommends not taking B9 in tablet form without a doctor's advice, to always follow the dosage and to avoid milk cereals and other foods that contain folic acid.
Earlier, nutritionist Rachel Fine named folic acid as a substance that slows down aging.
Since it is found, among other things, in avocados, Fine recommended that men over 50 eat the fruit more often.
In the UK, up to 75,000 people could die from the omicron strain by April
British scientists' forecasts show that up to 75,000 people could die in England in the next five months due to the spread of the omicron strain of the coronavirus, if restrictions are not tightened in winter.
The Guardian newspaper reported this, citing a study by experts from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), TASS reports.
According to the most optimistic forecast of experts who are part of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies at the British Cabinet, by April 2022, at least 25,000 deaths due to the omicron strain will be recorded in the country, and a total of about 175,000 patients will be hospitalized.
At the peak of the outbreak, hospitals will be treating more than 2,000 infected people a day.
"Serious measures to tackle coronavirus may be needed to avoid overwhelming the NHS if the Omicron variant is more transmissible than the Delta variant and current vaccines do not prevent infections," said mathematician Rosanna Barnard from LSHTM.
Earlier, the UK Health Security Agency reported that if the spread of the omicron strain continues at its current rate, about 1 million cases of infection will be identified in the country by the end of the year.
At the same time, by mid-December, the omicron strain could become dominant in the United Kingdom.
There are currently 1,898 cases of the Omicron variant of coronavirus in the UK, of which 633 were identified in the last 24 hours.
At the same time, on December 9, the head of the British Ministry of Health, Sajid Javid, pointed out that in reality this figure could already reach 10,000 cases.
I wanted to write a smart comment, but I read up to this point:
"A fur coat, obtained as a result of the incredible suffering of an unfortunate animal and its employment in a second job".
And it fell under the table!
It turns out that "unfortunate animal" is a husband, and I thought it was a chinchilla!

Demand for superyachts has grown by a quarter worldwide
Superyacht construction this year and orders for next year are breaking records worldwide, despite calls to reduce the carbon footprint and combat climate change.
The number of ordered yachts in the world ship register is 1200 units - a quarter more than last year.
In the era of tackling the consequences of climate change, it is hard to imagine that the number of people who have the desire and the money for a £50m-plus floating fortress will not decline, The Guardian writes.
But there are more and more of them.
This year, 25% more ships were ordered than last year.
Brokers say they have not seen such a frenzy in the market for 20 years.
The first reason is that many who can afford a yacht are fearful of contracting the virus on land and prefer to escape the pandemic on board their own vessel.
The second reason is also related to the coronavirus.
If before all these people went to the office and met with business partners in person, now the absolute majority of them work remotely and conduct negotiations via Zoom.
Broker Will Christie told the newspaper that shipyards are taking orders for new yachts for 2025 and beyond.
This means that clients are willing to pay more just to have their yacht ready at least a year or two earlier.
"People just want freedom and the super-rich could afford it," he says.
In the western society, many criticize such behavior of the rich and call it decadent.
The rich, say sociologists, don't want to understand that in times of scarcity, travel to space, life on yachts or flights on private jets cause irritation in society, because the elite does not want to share the responsibility for climate change with the rest of humanity.
Economists are calling on governments to act and are proposing new taxes and rules for the super-rich, though they acknowledge it will be extremely difficult to implement given the mobility of money.
In the meantime, it is only the number of ordered superyachts that is impressive, but also their characteristics.
Of the 1,200 ships, 27 have a stern length of more than 100 meters.
Norwegian billionaire Rekke is building the REV Ocean yacht, which is 183 meters long.
When launched, it will be the largest yacht in the world.
The yacht includes a "moon pool," as well as a submarine designed to explore the depths of the sea.
Helicopter pads, open-air cinemas and even a mixed martial arts platform have become common on existing superyachts. Professor of economic anthropology at Indiana University, Richard Wilk, says that compared to the total amount of greenhouse gas emissions, the carbon footprint of the super-rich is negligible.
But it has a symbolic meaning, given that there are just over 2,000 multi-billionaires in the world.
It's just another example of overconsumption by a very small group of people.
Scientists have found that the carbon footprint of billionaires is thousands of times greater than that of the average citizen of the planet.
If one person produces an average of 5 tonnes of CO2 per year, the planet's biggest polluter, Roman Abramovich, is responsible for 33.9 tonnes of greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere in 2018.
Two-thirds of his carbon footprint came from his 162.5-metre yacht, the Eclipse.
Even if the owner is not on board the yacht, the crew continues to pollute the planet.
The owner can call the captain and ask him to bring the yacht, for example, from the Mediterranean to the Caribbean.
Superyacht owners don't get much sympathy from others when they, like Australia's richest woman Gina Rinehart, who owns mines on the continent, complain on YouTube that there is no room for their giant ships to dock.
It is also hard to understand her call to build marinas for ships with a length of 50 meters.
Dangerous weekly alcohol dose linked to bowel cancer risk
American scientists have determined the amount of alcoholic beverages per week that increases the risk of developing cancer.
This is reported by the Daily Express.
Experts have concluded that the consumption of four or more servings of alcoholic beverages per week is associated with an increased risk of developing cancer.
At the same time, the likelihood of developing the disease increases with the amount of alcohol consumed.
In fact, men who drink moderately have a higher risk of bowel cancer than women.
Scientists cannot determine the exact cause of the development of this type of cancer, noting only that certain factors lead to a harmful process for the body.

Dogs can understand words and phrases at the level of a two-year-old child
Many, and more precisely all dog lovers, are convinced that these creatures are very smart.
But even they have no idea how sophisticated four-legged pets really are.
For many years, biologists have conducted various experiments to find out for sure how developed the intelligence of animals is.
Although a dog's vocabulary is not as extensive as a human's, a new study proves that a dog can consistently respond to 89 words or phrases.
The scientists' work was published in Sciencealert.
Dogs can't play chess or write poetry, they don't understand politics, economics or art, yet they often manage to fool their owners.
Some breeds, experts say, show the best results in understanding human language, but there are not enough statistics for accurate conclusions.
For example, some breeds are traditionally considered to be dog geniuses - for example, Labradors.
Scientists have concluded that dogs are capable of logical thinking and that their ability to learn is comparable to that of a two-year-old child.

Ukraine is preparing for a trade-off between the United States and Russia
The United States and Russia will “bargain” over Ukraine’s entry into NATO, analyst Alexander Kochetkov said in an article for the Glavred publication.
In his opinion, Washington and Moscow are planning to continue negotiations in the near future on the guarantees of the United States regarding the fact that Ukraine will not join the North Atlantic Alliance, despite the words of the American leader Joe Biden about the right of countries "to join anywhere".
If you are offered something that is obviously unacceptable, for example, to sell a close relative into sexual slavery, you will not bargain, but simply send the person who made the offer away.
And as for Ukraine, there will be bargaining," the analyst wrote.
Kochetkov added that Russia does not plan to attack Ukraine, but is seeking dialogue with Kiev.
"The preparations are carried out secretly, quickly, and they immediately move on to offensive actions, and do not wait until the grouping is detected and countermeasures are deployed," he noted.
China is promoting the development of the railway industry
Advanced Chinese technologies have attracted the attention of companies from the United States, Germany, France and other countries at the 2021 China International Rail Transit and Equipment Manufacturing Exhibition held in Zhuzhou City, Hunan Province/Central China/.
The core technologies developed by CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co. Ltd. allow trains to automatically detect and diagnose technical faults, noted company representative Hou Zhaowen.
The high-speed trains running on the China-Laos railway, which was put into operation at the beginning of this month, are already equipped with these technologies, which will ensure the reliability and operability of the rolling stock.
In the past six months, China has significantly increased the export of railway vehicles, and many countries in Asia and Europe are witnessing the "Chinese speed".
In May of this year, the first two-storey high-speed electric trains developed in China rolled off the production line of CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co., Ltd. for export to Europe.
With a maximum working speed of 200 kilometres per hour, these trains will run on the railways of Austria, Germany, Hungary and other European countries.
In November, the test operation of the metro train developed by the above-mentioned company for Turkey began.
The train will travel along the metro line connecting the center of Istanbul with the city's airport.
The line will open next year.
This will be the fastest metro line in Turkey with a speed of 120 kilometers per hour.
"China's railway equipment manufacturing industry is one of the most innovative industries and has the strongest international innovation competitiveness," said Feng Yaoxiang, head of the trade and investment department of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade (CCPIT).
"This industry is the main competitive advantage of China's high-end equipment manufacturing in the global market," said Feng Yaoshan.
After more than 60 years of hard work, China has created an advanced railway equipment production system with a full range of supporting facilities and large-scale production activities through a series of independent research and development.
According to Feng Yaoshan, the country ranks first in the level of electrification of railways and in the operational mileage of high-speed and urban railways.
Biologist lists early signs of dementia
Candidate of biological sciences, Semen Goloshechkin, in an interview with Sputnik radio, listed the early signs of dementia.
According to him, signs of future dementia can include forgetfulness, as well as a whole range of mild cognitive impairments, such as the inability to concentrate, plan, and reduced levels of abstract thinking.
There is currently a debate about whether hearing loss can be both an early sign of Alzheimer's disease and a risk factor for it, the expert said.
Golosheykin emphasized that the causes of dementia can be neurodegenerative disorders, head injuries, some infections, metabolic disorders, and a lack of certain vitamins.
He added that Alzheimer's disease and atherosclerosis of the brain's blood vessels are the most common causes of this syndrome.
The biologist noted that to date, doctors do not know effective ways to treat dementia.
Therefore, it is necessary to start its prevention in a timely manner.
According to him, studying foreign languages and active communication will help reduce the risk of developing dementia.
The WHO also recommends maintaining a moderate level of physical activity, regularly exercising cognitive skills through games and hobbies that require intense engagement of memory and logical thinking
"There are recommendations for the use of various dietary supplements, however, their effectiveness and usefulness are still being debated in the scientific community," said Golosheykin.
"The World Health Organization recommends maintaining a moderate level of physical activity, regular training of cognitive skills and abilities through games and hobbies that require intensive involvement of memory and logical thinking," said Golosheikin.
Earlier, a UK charity for dementia research said the disease was increasingly affecting people in their 40s.
Doctors have named the early symptoms of Alzheimer's disease.
The first warning sign can be considered problems with vision, due to which the patient acquires difficulties in recognizing objects.
Another sign of developing dementia is aphasia, a condition where a person can't find the right words to express what they want to say.
A neurologist has demanded that Saakashvili be sent abroad for treatment
Former President of Georgia Mikheil Saakashvili needs psychoneurological treatment and rehabilitation abroad, neurologist Otar Toidze, who is part of the council of doctors created by the Georgian ombudsman, told journalists.
His [Saakashvili's] neurological status is the leading factor in his illness.
The stable problems are problems with movement, coordination, and mood swings," the specialist said, noting that this does not go beyond the norm and now the former president needs to be sent for special rehabilitation.
"We call this neurorehabilitation and psychoneurological rehabilitation, the possibility of which we did not find in Georgia," Toidze noted, demanding that Saakashvili be treated in a special institution, which does not exist in Georgia.
On the evening of December 7, Saakashvili began to sabotage his receipt of medical care after prison officials disciplined him.
The Georgian politician quickly managed to have the punishment overturned and to restore his former rights.

We feed all the drunks, the drug addicts, who have also lost their health because of their stupidity.
Then we are surprised by the extension of the retirement age.
This money could be spent on treating people who are actually ill.

Protests against COVID passports held in Spain
Protests against the mandatory COVID-19 vaccination certificate were held in the Spanish cities of Barcelona and Valencia, reports the Europa Press agency.
In the Catalan capital, the number of participants in the action was approximately 3,000 people.
In Barcelona, COVID-passports have become mandatory for going to bars, restaurants, gyms, nursing homes and nightclubs.
Many of the protesters came to the rally without masks.
With slogans on their posters, they accused the state of totalitarianism and called for respect for the choice of citizens.
In Valencia, vaccination passports will also be required to enter entertainment venues and restaurants with a capacity of more than 50 people.
Protesters in the city have claimed a medical dictatorship and called the vaccination an experiment.
Since the start of the pandemic, more than 5.2 million cases of coronavirus infection have been identified in Spain, and more than 88,000 patients have died.
Russia is also planning to introduce restrictions for the unvaccinated.
The government introduced draft laws on a unified system of QR codes into the State Duma on 12 November.
It is expected that Russians will be able to visit places of mass gatherings, cultural institutions, food and retail outlets with either a vaccination or recovery certificate, or a medical exemption from vaccination.
The same rules will apply to travel by train and plane.

A steep climb: How Chinese are becoming skiers
The Olympics should attract millions of people to the slopes and help create international-level resorts in the country
China hopes that the Olympics will not only attract 300 million citizens to participate in winter sports, which will allow the collection of the 1 trillion yuan designated by President Xi Jinping, but also promote the economic development of backward remote provinces.
The Taiwu ski resort in Zhangjiajie, located near the site of the Winter Olympics, is becoming increasingly popular with Chinese people.
In addition to infrastructure construction in the region, landscaping work is also being carried out: workers are planting trees.
The country has more than 700 ski resorts, but only 20 of them are large enough to host international-level competitions.
In many regions of China where the resorts are located, including Zhangjiakou, there are problems with snow.
The main long-term goal is to ensure a comfortable and interesting holiday at Chinese resorts, so that all newcomers become regulars.
However, it is still a long way off.
Organizing committee adviser Justin Downs says the Chinese ski industry has changed beyond recognition since his last visit in 2007.
Every winter, more and more Chinese are heading to the slopes.
Fiona, a snowboarder from Beijing, is one of them.
Despite the major changes, it will take many more years to create a ski culture here, says Downs.
Many resorts are located in agricultural and mining areas.
These regions still need to be actively developed and the necessary infrastructure for recreation needs to be created there.
Gao Makong, 70, lives in Chunli, not far from the site of the Winter Olympics.
He notes that in recent years there has been a boom in winter sports tourism here.
Two years ago, a high-speed railway was built from Beijing to Chongli, and now none of the local residents are unemployed.
There are more and more shops opening in the country that sell clothing and equipment for winter sports.
Food outlets with national dishes are opening on the slopes.
Taiwan now even has a COVID-19 testing station.
China is striving to create a thriving winter sports industry, its athletes to become leaders in major international competitions, and its resorts and equipment to reach world-class levels.
More than 500 million people worldwide could fall into extreme poverty due to the pandemic, WHO says
More than 500 million people worldwide could be pushed into extreme poverty by the coronavirus pandemic, which has stalled humanity's progress towards universal health coverage, the World Health Organization (WHO) and World Bank (WB) said.
To mark the 12 December International Day of Universal Health Coverage, WHO and the World Bank have published two complementary reports.
They noted that the pandemic has led to disruptions in the provision of health services and has caused excessive strain on health care systems.
In this regard, for the first time in 10 years, the population's immunization coverage has decreased, and the death rate from tuberculosis and malaria has increased.
The WHO and the World Bank have stressed that the pandemic has caused "the worst economic crisis since the 1930s, making it harder for people to pay for treatment."
The situation is pushing more than 500 million people "into extreme poverty because they have to pay for these services out of their own pockets."
In October, United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said the coronavirus pandemic had pushed more than 100 million people into poverty, with more than four billion people having virtually no social support.

Reuters: Taiwanese minister cut from Democracy Summit broadcast at White House request
Taiwan's Minister of Digital Affairs Audrey Tang's speech at a panel discussion during the U.S.-organized "Summit for Democracy" was in video-free mode, according to a recording of the summit on YouTube.
Reuters, citing sources, says the image was taken down at the request of the White House.
According to them, the reason was a map on which Taiwan was marked in a different color from the People's Republic of China, which considers the island its territory.
The map Ms. Tan was showing was compiled by the South African non-governmental organization CIVICUS and ranked countries around the world according to their level of civil liberties.
Taiwan was marked green on it as "free," while the PRC, DPRK, Laos, and Vietnam were marked red as "closed."
After the minister showed the map, the picture from her side was replaced with a screenshot with the note that the opinions of the discussion participants "do not necessarily reflect the position of the US government".
China was not invited to the "Summit for Democracy".
Reuters sources note that the map shown by the Taiwanese minister may have been in conflict with the "one China" policy followed by Washington.
One of the agency's sources said that after the map was displayed, the U.S. National Security Council angrily contacted the State Department, accusing it of showing Taiwan as a separate country.
The Washington-organized “Summit for Democracy” was held from December 9 to 10 with the participation of representatives from 110 countries and territories, as well as civil society organizations and charitable organizations.
Russia was not invited to the summit.
During the “zero day” of the summit, the Nobel Peace Prize laureate and editor-in-chief of Novaya Gazeta, Dmitry Muratov, called for the creation of an international fund through which money obtained through corruption would be given to charity.
Earlier today, Deputy Secretary of the Russian Security Council, Yuri Averyanov, stated that the summit was “anti-Russian and anti-Chinese”.

New Shepard spacecraft with six tourists on board made a suborbital flight
Blue Origin's New Shepard spacecraft with six tourists on board made a suborbital flight on Saturday, December 11.
The journey, which was broadcast on the company's website, lasted a total of more than ten minutes, after which the capsule with the passengers descended to Earth, TASS reports.
The launch of the carrier rocket was conducted from the cosmodrome in the area of the American city of Van Horn (Texas).
The ship rose to an altitude of just over 100 km, and the space tourists found themselves in a state of weightlessness.
The launch vehicle itself landed normally on the launch pad.
Blue Origin successfully completed the first suborbital flight of the New Shepard spacecraft with passengers on board on July 20.
SKETCHES OF A VILLAGE MOSCOWITE.
Don't lump them all together - there are bad people, you may have a specific reason to complain about them...
But what does the number of children, age, pension fund, and so on have to do with it?
They write that they are "scum, they didn't return the money."
But how many and when to have children is not your business, as long as they do not intend to hang these children around your neck.
And since this is ruled out, what right do you have to condemn them?
Maybe it's just in education...
The elected (by themselves) parents dictate their own rules, openly disregarding those that already exist.
And what if this applies to other areas of life, court proceedings and so on?
For them, the laws are not written.
And what if dad does implement his method of upbringing and education?
It's awful and a very bad example for others.

China strengthens prevention and control of COVID-19 in cities with land ports
The Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism of the State Council has issued a circular to strengthen the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic in cities where land ports are located in order to further prevent the importation of the infection from abroad.
According to the circular, people leaving the specified cities must provide a negative result of a COVID-19 nucleic acid test obtained within 48 hours before departure.
Those arriving in cities where land border crossings are located must take at least one COVID-19 nucleic acid test upon arrival.
The document states that these requirements will take effect from the day when the relevant provincial-level administrative units determine and publish the zones of these cities, until March 15, 2022.
In addition, it is noted that cities that have land border crossings and meet certain conditions may consider the possibility of creating buffer zones to prevent and control the COVID-19 epidemic within their jurisdiction.

The Dimaks OK Basis mattress, size 130x185.
The OK Basis spring orthopedic mattress is one of the most affordable models in the line.
The practical Balance Foam filler gives the mattress all the necessary orthopedic properties, but at the same time keeps the price at a budget level.
This product is an optimal combination of price and quality.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs spoke about the "sad conclusion" in relations between Russia and the United States
Deputy Foreign Minister of Russia Sergei Ryabkov, in an interview with Izvestia, assessed the prospects for relations between Moscow and Washington.
He noted that the long history of interaction has led to sad conclusions, and the problems between the two countries did not begin yesterday.
One-sided negative predictability is there, but as far as any prospects for improving relations are concerned, everything is completely unpredictable.
It's a sad conclusion to a long journey that we've been on with this administration, with Trump, with Obama.
The problems did not start yesterday," the diplomat pointed out.
According to Ryabkov, the problem is related to the desire of the United States to impose its approaches on Russia on many issues.
The deputy head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs added that he would not dare to make optimistic predictions about the prospects for improving relations and would not expect a change in Washington's position.
He explained that, with the exception of areas such as strategic stability and cybersecurity, no progress has been made.
At the same time, Russia is calling on the United States to take a responsible approach to issues of international security and hopes that the signals will be heard and the Americans will listen to the arguments of common sense.
Earlier, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said at a meeting with US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken that Moscow was ready to restore dialogue with the United States.
Virologist warns of the danger of vaccinating with a nasal COVID drug outside of hospitals
People who have been vaccinated with a nasal COVID-19 vaccine may develop an allergy and need medical assistance, so the first vaccination points for this vaccine should not be set up in airports and shopping centres.
This was reported to TASS by virologist, corresponding member of the Russian Academy of Sciences, head of the laboratory of bionanotechnology, microbiology and virology of Novosibirsk State University, Sergey Netesov.
It is easier to set up vaccination points for the nasal vaccine in airports and shopping centres, but I would do this only in medical facilities at first.
The fact is that there is a possibility of an allergic reaction to such a vaccine, it is small, but it is desirable that the person sit near the doctor's office afterwards.
Doctors have special sets of anti-allergy drugs that work in a minute or two, which is sometimes very necessary," said Netesov.
According to the virologist, it will be possible to think about vaccination in shopping centers when experience in using the drug is accumulated.
He also stressed that when using the nasal vaccine, it is important that it reaches the mucous membrane in the nasal cavity.
However, there is a possibility that the vaccine will not reach its destination if the person being vaccinated blows their nose after the injection when they have a blocked nose.

Serbia produced 2 million doses of the Sputnik V vaccine
The Sputnik V vaccine is the most popular in Serbia.
Serbia has produced about 2 million doses of the Russian Sputnik V vaccine, Minister of Innovation and Technological Development of the country Nenad Popovich told TASS.
"At the Torlak state institute, about 2 million doses of the Sputnik V vaccine have been produced so far, and we expect at least 4 million to be produced in the coming period," said Popovic.
According to him, the Russian vaccine is the most popular among the Serbs.
In connection with this, the republic plans to make an additional purchase of one million doses of the vaccine from Russia.
The Minister of Innovation and Technological Development of Serbia also expressed interest in the production of the nasal vaccine "Sputnik V" and the "Sputnik Light" drug on the territory of the state.
Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin announced that Russia has delivered almost two million doses of the Russian-made Sputnik V coronavirus vaccine to Serbia.

But no one should say of himself or of those who believe as he does that they are the only true believers.
Because if they can say of themselves that they are true believers, then so can others.

Alexander M., please remind me, what was the style of the marathon at the 2021 World Championships?
Do you see the ski track, along which the participants of the race must finish in the classic style?
Attention, question - what is Klebo doing to the right of Bolshunov and how does he want to get onto the ski run if he was behind him on the turn before the gate?
And the "best finisher" at 1.5 km and after 50 km are two different things.
It was a long time ago...
I was, and in fact, I wasn't even a driver.
He had the right, but he couldn't drive.
They suggested going 250 km in one direction on a MAZ!
Young, bad, agreed.
The owner is nearby, drinking vodka, and I'm driving.
First, as king, he took the axis!
A column formed up behind me.
I missed.
Then the belt on the power steering broke.
Then the police stopped us.
The column was organized, and their car broke down.
It needs to be towed.
The owner of the MAZ explained that he was drunk, and the driver was inexperienced.
And he asked him, "How drunk are you?"
You don't trip, you don't fall.
In front of us with the flashing lights and forward!
In my opinion, he can't get out of the commercial, and he has every right to be upset.
Pevtsov is saying the same thing: about the return of the retirement age.
Long ago, all budgets were drawn up taking into account the billions of pre-pensioners that were not received.
Who is feeding them this nonsense?
The UK recorded 1,239 cases of the omicron strain of the coronavirus in one day - RT in Russian
In the UK, 1239 cases of infection with the new omicron strain of the coronavirus have been identified in a day.
Sky News reports this.
In particular, 1196 new cases of the "omicron" strain were recorded in England, 38 people were infected with the new variant of the infection in Scotland and five in Northern Ireland.
The total number of COVID-19 cases from the new strain in the UK has reached 3,137.
Earlier, scientists from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine in a pessimistic forecast calculated that 75,000 people could die in England by April due to a coronavirus outbreak caused by the "omicron" strain.
Peskov warned of the suffering of Western countries that are imposing anti-Russian sanctions
The press secretary of the President of the Russian Federation, Dmitry Peskov, commented on the possible introduction of anti-Russian sanctions in the event of the continuation of “aggressive actions” against Ukraine, including due to the alleged “invasion” of the country’s territory.
“It is impossible to impose restrictions on Russia and not suffer yourself”, the official representative of the Kremlin said on the air of the Russia 1 television channel.
Peskov says "everyone in the world understands this."
Earlier it was reported that the United States was considering the possibility of introducing anti-Russian sanctions in the energy sector as a last resort.
In addition, Washington and the European Union plan to impose restrictions that will make it more difficult to convert rubles into dollars for Russian banks and the Russian Direct Investment Fund.
At the same time, the head of Sberbank, German Gref, is convinced that this is impossible.
From reasonable people - reasonable comments!
Something about these simple-to-the-point-of-nausea recipes is making me sick.
Apparently, they've run out of ideas.
Even in the distant days of my childhood, my mother baked delicious pies and cakes, and it never occurred to me to compare a piece of bread with jam to a cake.
Ksenia, you don't need to tell me anything, my mind must figure it out on its own!
"The inability of the mind separated from the spirit to perceive" - what are you talking about?!
Imagine you have to explain this to a dumb kid, how would you do it?!
(Keep in mind that children up to 3-5 years old still have open channels of communication with the subtle world, and the child may know more than you!)
New Caledonia residents reject independence from France
According to the final results of the third referendum on the independence of New Caledonia, the overwhelming majority of participants refused to leave the French Union.
This was reported by the French TV channel BFM.TV on December 12.
96.5% of those who voted were against independence.
3.51% of the inhabitants of the archipelago in the South Pacific supported independence from France.
2.99% of ballots were voided.
Voter turnout on that day was very low: only about 55% of the archipelago's residents went to the polls.
According to experts, the low turnout is explained by the calls of the separatists to refuse to participate in the referendum due to the coronavirus.
Paris refused to postpone the date of the referendum.
In October 2020, residents of New Caledonia voted against independence from France in a referendum.
A referendum on independence was already held in the region in 2018.
Most residents supported the archipelago remaining part of France.
New Caledonia is almost 20,000 kilometers from mainland France.
In 1853, France declared New Caledonia its property.
About 270,000 people live on the archipelago, and the territory has a special administrative-territorial status.
A 1998 agreement between Paris and the New Caledonia administration allows the region to hold a vote on its independence every two years.

WHO considers “omicron” to be less dangerous than “delta”
The World Health Organization (WHO) has preliminarily determined that “omicron” is less dangerous than the delta strain of the coronavirus.
However, there are data indicating that vaccines are less effective against the new variant of COVID-19.
As of 9 December, “omicron” has been registered in 63 countries.
"The preliminary data and the significantly altered antigenic profile of the "omicron" strain protein suggest a decrease in the effectiveness of the vaccine against infection and transmission of the variant.
Preliminary findings from South Africa suggest that it ("disease severity" - rare.) may be less severe than "delta"", the WHO technical note says.
The organisation notes that so far all registered cases of "omicron" infection in the EU have been mild or asymptomatic.
At the same time, the new strain, according to preliminary data, is spreading faster than "delta".
Two cases of infection with the omicron strain have been registered in Russia.
They were "previously immunized," the Gamaleya Center reported.
The head of Rospotrebnadzor, Anna Popova, stated that there is currently no reliable data that the new variant of the coronavirus is less dangerous than the others.

Ukraine has named four scenarios for Zelensky
Former People's Deputy Vadim Denisenko listed four scenarios for the development of events for the President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky in 2022.
In his opinion, the head of state may remain without the support of the West, and may also make compromises on Donbass.
Denisenko spoke about this on Sunday, 12 December, in a publication on the Glavred portal.
The first option, which Denisenko called "the perfect storm," suggests that key Western countries will stop supporting Ukraine, reaching an agreement on the country's future without its participation.
Such a development would set the stage for a deep crisis that Kyiv could face in 2023.
"At the same time, there is a decrease in prices for key goods that we traditionally export <...> internal protests and confrontation between the authorities and key FPGs (financial and industrial groups. - Ed.)", the former parliamentarian added.
According to Denisenko, there is another scenario for the development of the situation - "war against all".
This forecast will come true in the event of high turbulence in world politics, in which the Ukrainian authorities will face a number of problems.
Because of this situation, the Ukrainian leadership may make compromises on Donbas, as a result of which there may be a confrontation within the country.
At the end of the summer, Zelensky's position will weaken, the probability of such a situation, according to the former MP, is up to 50-55%.
The third option for the development of the situation in Ukrainian politics is the confrontation between the groups of the population that disagree with Zelensky and the president, which may result in the seizure of control over the power bloc and the implementation of “populist initiatives”.
In the event of such a crisis scenario, Zelensky will begin the “reformatting of power”, added Denisenko.
Another scenario is turning Zelensky into the “father of the nation”.
This can be caused by some event that will be a strong shock to society.
"The event must be large enough to provoke a reaction from external partners and lead to an increase in support for Ukraine," Denisenko said.
Such a development of events is possible as a result of a natural disaster, a man-made catastrophe or Russia's aggressive actions, the former deputy believes.
At the same time, the Russian side has already rejected any possibility of an "attack" on Ukraine.
In Moscow, they noted that it is the Ukrainian authorities, NATO and the United States that are increasing military activity near the Russian borders.
Earlier, on November 11, the poll results of the sociological group "Rating" showed that the rating of the Ukrainian president fell to record low levels, amounting to 19.3%.
This is the lowest rating since his election as head of state.
Analysts predicted a situation in which, in the event of the upcoming presidential elections in Ukraine, only 21.8% would vote for Zelensky, while 14.5% would vote for the country's former president, Petro Poroshenko.
At the same time, only 19.3% of all those surveyed expressed support for the president.

Thanks to the author for the story about the great athlete, I didn't know that Elena Shushunova died, it's very upsetting to learn such things.
I remember how I cheered for her at the Olympics in Seoul, for us, residents of Primorye, it was a live broadcast, real time.
Such a passion, the emotions were off the charts, I remember the joy when Elena won.
They also rejoiced in all the other victories, just as they had cheered for Salnikov, for the footballers, for all the Soviet athletes of that time.
I once saw a documentary on TV about one of the Central American countries, and there the watermelons were rolled up the gangway onto the ship, like barrels.
The watermelons were of a monstrous size.
I myself worked many times as a young man on the collection and loading of watermelons in the Astrakhan region and never encountered watermelons weighing more than a pud.
I buy watermelons weighing 4-5 kg straight from the garden and not before the beginning of August.
Balcony bra with soft lace cups (size: 90E, colour: beige, composition: 90% polyamide, 10% elastane, item number: 12008).
Balcony bra with soft lace cups on frames.
The lower part of the cup is reinforced with a non-elastic transparent fabric.
The side of the cup, in the area of the bra strap attachment, is reinforced with non-elastic fabric in the fold, without additional seams for comfort.
It is this element that prevents the lace from stretching.
The richness of the lace can be appreciated thanks to the festoon along the neckline and under the bust.
The vertical ribs on the side panels of the single-layer microfiber prevent the fabric from twisting at larger sizes.
I really didn't like the article, it was mean and venomous.

The poet arrested for the action on Red Square: "They give 10 days for a quote from Yevtushenko, here it is, the power of poetry!"
At the beginning of the week, 21-year-old poet Alexander Volchenkov was arrested for ten days.
An HSE student was detained in Red Square with a placard on which the hashtag #poetofrussiaismorethanjustapoet was written.
This quote belongs to the writer Evgeny Evtushenko.
A protocol was drawn up against Alexander for a repeated violation of the procedure for holding a public action.
He was first detained on January 23 at Pushkin Square, at a rally in support of Alexei Navalny.
“The goal was to draw attention to poetry in general, and now interest in it, unfortunately, has been lost, to the decline of general culture in Russia, and there is also little hope of inspiring unknown poets to write their poems on the Internet under this hashtag”, Alexander explains.
We contacted the young poet to find out the circumstances of his detention and to learn more about the message of his message.
How did the police officers treat you during your arrest this time and previously?
What did the department ask, and how did they comment on your action?
This time the officers were more polite, the arrest was as polite as possible, as strange as it may sound in the context of this word.
The OMON officers took Pushkinskaya and took it hard.
They asked the standard questions about motives.
When they heard it, they basically looked at it, if not approvingly, then understandingly.
With the exception of the blowhole on all four sides of the monkey, everything was perfectly correct, but I knew what I was getting into.
And if after the action under this hashtag, even a few people start writing their poems, I will not have spent these 10 days in jail in vain.
Maxim, according to the protocol, talk to each other in the language of the Tumba-Yumba tribe.
At public and official events, they speak in the language of the people around them so that everyone understands what happened in the Bundestag on 25 September 2001, or in their native language with an interpreter.
It is protocol and nothing more, by the way, Angela Merkel speaks Russian very well and yet uses an interpreter.
And at official events, the stenographer is still taking notes by hand, and the stenographer is not required to know several languages.
If you don't want to say a lot of words, just say no!
But there is so much water.
Well, go as a tourist for six months "to the Andes, then to Nepal".
Before that, convert all assets into liquid shares.
And gradually sell these shares, opening an account in any bank in the world.
Sell not in dollars, but in a currency less dependent on the United States, such as Swiss francs.
And then file for divorce from America.
However, this is not all that keeps Americans in the United States.
It keeps them believing that the U.S. is better than anywhere else.
That's how they grow them.

Researchers tell how potatoes help in the fight against age-related disorders
The study found that potatoes are rich in vitamins and trace elements that help improve blood circulation and lower cholesterol levels.
The root vegetable contains B group vitamins, vitamin C, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, riboflavin, folic acid and pantothenic acid.
All of these elements help the body's systems to function.
In addition, potatoes help in the fight against age-related disorders.
Due to its high fibre content, it is beneficial for the digestive system, and with regular use can also help prevent hypertension and atherosclerosis.
However, for the greatest benefit, the root vegetable is best stewed or boiled, and not fried in oil.
The Daily Express previously warned that potatoes can be dangerous for diabetics, along with other high glycemic index foods.
These are foods that contain carbohydrates that break down quickly into sugars, such as sugar, sweet soft drinks, white rice, and white bread.
In early December, Kommersant newspaper warned of a possible shortage of Russian table potatoes, noting a reduction in its production in personal subsidiary farms and an increase in processing capacity.
According to market participants, the current shortage of products can only be filled by imports.
Lostfilm, lordfilm and other pirates will be removed from the Yandex search results
Candidates for elimination
In 2015, rights holders from the RAEC/Media cluster compiled a list of the 100 largest pirate sites on the Runet, and most of them ceased to exist, says Karen Kazaryan, CEO of the Institute for Internet Research.
But some - Kinogo, Lostfilm, Filmix - have managed to survive, in part thanks to regular changes of domain name, he adds.
For example, on Lostfilm, which is available in the search results of both "Yandex" and Google, you can watch pirated copies of the Netflix series "Squid Game" and "Tenderness" directed by Anna Melikyan - the original series of Russia's largest video service ivi (which is part of AIV).
On Kinogo, which is also available in search engine results, you can watch the animated novelty "Encanto", but, judging by the video quality, it is a so-called screener (a pirated copy of the film taken in a movie theater).
The series "Univer. 10 years later" from the TNT channel (which is part of Gazprom-Media) is available on Filmix, which can also be found via search engines.
Svetlana M., I'm sorry, of course, but I would not care if the son was offended for his mother or not.
If we have some kind of misunderstanding, it's better not to get involved at all, and just get out of the way.
Of course, it's good that this happens rarely.

Lyudmila, China is now at the forefront of space technology.
Russia is already hopelessly behind.
"This idea developed by the Poles" - it would be more accurate to say that Poland only reworked the idea of 1776 for itself, but developed it quite effectively.
In fact, the slogan "The periphery is not Russia" appeared in 1848.
Which, in general and in principle, does not really change the essence of the matter.

One of the distinctive features of such lamps is the weightlessness of the structure.
With the help of thin, almost invisible wires, which can be adjusted in height, the impression is created that the chandelier is hovering in the air.
The metallic gold armature and matte white mini-chandeliers will easily complement any color scheme, and the hanging chandelier and wall lamp presented in the collection will be a ready-made ensemble for lighting the living room, bedroom, and hallway.
Well, it's a matter of taste and color, as they say.
I really liked Tarkhuna, not the current one, of course.
The freshly squeezed juices from the tall glass cylinders were very tasty.
Three servings of syrup is overkill, in my opinion.
Two was just right.
Dimatex Micro Ultimate mattress, size 160x190
Micro Ultimate orthopedic spring mattress.
The model is convenient in that it has two different softness surfaces - high stiffness and slightly more than average.
The product includes only high-quality and premium fillers, which have proven themselves only from the best side.
Springs: a block of independent "micropack" springs is installed in the center of the model.
This means that there are 2000 springs per sleeping place, which work completely independently of each other.
It is their functioning that gives the unique point adjustment.
"Micropack" is the highest frequency of all the variety of Dimax spring blocks, so it has a pronounced orthopedic effect and is considered premium.
Fillers: Above and below the springs are combinations of layers of coir and natural latex.
The only difference is the order of the tiles.
If one surface has latex, the other has coconut coir.
Such a tandem of fillers has long been considered classic, since it gives the mattress not only orthopedic, but also anatomical properties.
If the coir provides proper back support, the latex gives surface adaptation to the human body.
Case: the model comes with a knitted Aloe Vera cover.
At the customer's request, it can be made either removable or stationary.
The overall height of the product is 27 cm, and the recommended load on the sleeping place is 170 kg.
Warranty and safety: the warranty period is 3 years.
The mattress has received all the necessary certificates and documents confirming its complete safety and reliability in use.
The orthopedic foam used in the mattress is CertiPUR certified.
Estonian scientists will look for life on Venus
The Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in collaboration with the Tartu Observatory and other research institutions and companies, is preparing three space missions to Venus to search for signs of life in the atmosphere, Aktuaalne Kaamera reported on Sunday.
The five-year missions aim to assess the habitability of Venus' clouds, and then search for life there.
For the project, the Tartu scientists proposed instruments for measuring the acidity and oxygen content of Venus' clouds.
It was previously thought that the clouds of Venus, the planet closest to Earth, were too acidic to support life, but Venus was probably originally an Earth-like planet.
A sample from Venus is due to arrive during the third mission.
If we find life there, the main question will be whether it is similar to or different from Earth life.
If it is very similar, it will be obvious that life on Earth did not start on Earth.
If it is different, then it is more likely that life began on Earth," said the head of the Estonian team of the Venus Life Finder project, Mihkel Pajusalu.

Metaverses will change Russian business
The metaverse became a hot topic this fall when Mark Zuckerberg announced Facebook's rebrand to Meta.
For the market, this event was an important signal: the largest player confirmed the development of a new format of digital interaction between people.
This means that business in Russia, like everywhere else in the world, will invest in the creation of their own metaverses and their subsequent monetization.
The metaverse should be viewed as a continuation of objectively existing trends.
On the one hand, there is a trend towards creating remote interactions in the conditions of the pandemic, because people are tired of isolation and restrictions.
On the other hand, it is the result of businesses' desire to develop ecosystems and adapt their operational models to them.
The third - they are a logical continuation of the trend of digitization of assets, when any rights, securities, works of art and even money are going digital.
You're right Anya, changing your diet is a conscious process.
When you start eating properly, you don't want anything too fatty and unhealthy.
Of course, we will have the traditional Olivier salad and herring under a fur coat for the holiday, but no one is forcing me to eat it all at once.
You can eat it by the spoonful, try it - and that's enough.
After all, there are really ten days off ahead, so you can prepare any delicious and healthy dishes.
And how much hellish effort, time, and resources she had to put into her training.
And after five vaults, she was out of the gold.
And she also understands that she won't last four years until the next Olympics, i.e. she will never be an Olympic champion.
And if you haven't been through the simple sport or can't imagine all the hell she's been through, DON'T JUDGE.
British economist failed to predict 2022
British economist Jim O'Neill was unable to predict 2022, as he believes that such attempts will end in failure.
He wrote about this in an article for Project Syndicate.
The expert believes that the next year will be full of unpredictability and any trend can change the turnover.
The most important factor remains the coronavirus pandemic, and inflation is in second place, he believes.
O'Neill also admitted that he does not know whether the price increases are temporary or not.
As the specialist pointed out, even before the pandemic it was clear that "the world of infinite generosity of central banks had outlived itself" and it was time to return to a relationship where interest rates, taking inflation into account, would correlate with expected GDP growth rates.
O'Neill noted that in the context of the pandemic, the continuation of ultra-loose economic policy could, according to some experts, lead to a new surge in inflation.
In addition, attention should be paid to the issue of productivity growth, as well as the rise in poverty and climate change, O'Neill concluded.
Earlier, the head of the Global Research Department at Otkritie Investment Mikhail Shulgin said that positive expectations for the dollar exchange rate in 2022 remain, but the growth potential will be less significant.
Among the risks to the value of the dollar, Shulgin named the monetary and credit policy of the Federal Reserve, the dynamics of oil prices, and fears against the backdrop of the coronavirus pandemic.
I have to agree.
But one thing is pleasing: if you compare yourself to yourself, five years ago there were fewer containers.
It's better now.
There is progress, but it is slow.
There is another problem: there are many environmental initiatives in cities, but people don't know about them.
All kinds of eco-taxis that take waste from the home.

There are no more of them.

Russians gave car dealers about 4.5% of the country's GDP
According to the results of 10 months of 2021, Russians spent 2.784 trillion rubles on the purchase of new cars, which is 28% more than in the same period last year, according to statistical data from the Russian Automotive Market Research (NAPI) agency.
To put it in perspective, a similar amount (about 3 trillion roubles) was spent by the state to support citizens and the economy during the coronavirus pandemic.
In September last year, at a meeting of the heads of states of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, President Vladimir Putin said that such an amount is comparable to more than 4.5% of the country's gross domestic product (GDP) for 2020.
In terms of revenue, the Korean brand Kia is leading the Russian market.
In the first 10 months of this year, he managed to sell cars worth 325.7 billion rubles, which is almost 24% more than a year earlier.
The related Kia brand has an even greater increase - more than 35%, and the revenue from the sale of cars is estimated at 279.3 billion rubles.
This brand is in the leading position in terms of the increase in the weighted average price of a car - for a year, it grew by almost 21%, to 1.94 million roubles - only Changan, Chery, Geely and Mercedes-Benz had a stronger price increase.
At the same time, the volume of sales of Korean brands has not grown so significantly: according to the statistics of the committee of automakers of the Association of European Business in Russia, in quantitative terms, Kia sold 9.4% more cars over the same period than a year earlier.
Hyundai - almost 12%.
The Japanese Toyota closes the top three leaders in terms of sales in monetary terms - Russians spent 275.5 billion rubles on cars of this brand in 10 months, which is 14% more than a year earlier.
The Japanese are followed by Mercedes-Benz with a figure of 266.1 billion rubles (+75%) - the German premium brand has increased both the volume of sales (by 37%) and the average price of a car (almost 28%, up to 8.2 million rubles).
“Mercedes-Benz is simultaneously experiencing a good growth in sales and average price – more, for example, than BMW – from here comes the greater growth in financial capacity”, explained the CEO of the National Association of Car Importers, Tatyana Arabadjieva.
In terms of sales growth, Chinese brands are showing fantastic figures, and have also significantly increased their financial capacity this year."
Russian Lada, in terms of income growth, is showing average market indicators (plus 28%), on cars of this brand Russians spent 229.4 billion roubles in 10 months.
Companies whose car sales in units in 2021 fell are at the same level as last year in terms of financial capacity: in particular, Volkswagen, Mitsubishi and Nissan.
UAZ is in the red: over 10 months, Russians spent 12 billion roubles on off-road vehicles and pickups of this brand, compared to 12.4 billion roubles a year earlier.
Against the backdrop of problems with the supply of car components and production disruptions that have affected the entire global automotive industry, car companies continue to continuously adjust prices - AvtoVAZ itself has raised the price of Lada models seven times this year, the last price increase (by 8-10 thousand rubles) took place at the end of November.
Other car manufacturers regularly change the price tags on their products.
The volume of the Russian car market in monetary terms will continue to increase - in addition to the shortage of cars, inflation is also contributing to this, as well as the desire of car manufacturers to make up for past losses, experts believe.
In the context of a shortage of cars, I think that many carmakers have even been able to pass on to the consumer some of the costs of past periods that they were not able to include in the price of cars before,
says VTB Capital’s automotive analyst Vladimir Bespalov.
I believe that in financial terms, car manufacturers are doing very well right now, maintaining high sales margins."
A secondary indicator of this is the rate of growth in the cost of cars, which has been observed during 2021, the prices of new cars are growing faster than inflation, the expert clarifies.
In the long term, the market will grow both in terms of quantity and in terms of money, but mainly due to inflation and the complexity of the design of the machines themselves, predicts Bespalov.
With increased supply, opportunities to raise prices will be limited.
In monetary terms, the Russian car market will continue to grow in the coming year, even if the growth in car prices slows, car manufacturers will be able to get their income from volumes, notes independent automotive industry consultant Sergey Burgazlyev.
Given the high demand and low supply, car manufacturers are now trying to make the most profit from each car sold, notes Burgazliev.
It is not expected that there will be an increase in the production of cars for at least the next six months, and in Russia, the frenzy is being fueled by the uncertainty of citizens about the future.
Against the backdrop of the situation on the market, cars turned out to be a good investment - a car bought a year ago, even with mileage, can now be sold for more than the original price, the expert notes.
Biden spoke about the transfer of US military to Ukraine in the event of a Russian invasion
The U.S. leadership has never considered sending American troops to Ukraine in the event of a "Russian invasion."
U.S. President Joe Biden made this statement.
"There have never been such plans," the head of the White House said in response to a journalist's question about whether the United States had abandoned such an idea.
Biden noted that in the event of an escalation of the situation around Ukraine, Russia will face economic consequences.
At the same time, he emphasized that the United States and NATO have no obligation to use military force to protect Ukraine in the event of an escalation.
The American leader also stated that the possibility of using American troops unilaterally for the defense of Ukraine is not on the agenda.
Biden explained that if Russia invades Ukraine, the United States will deploy forces to NATO countries in Eastern Europe (Bulgaria, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Estonia).
"We're going to have to put more American and NATO troops on the eastern flank, the B9 - all those NATO countries that we have a sacred obligation to defend against any attack from Russia," Biden said.
Earlier, the press secretary of the President of Russia, Dmitry Peskov, emphasized that Moscow has no intention of invading the territory of Ukraine.
At the same time, he pointed out that Moscow sees the problem in the combat use of the drones supplied to Kiev by Turkey, as well as in the fact that "American weapons are approaching our territory".
I immediately leave such interviews.
If during the interview they want to make me listen to screams, wait for hours, drink some incomprehensible brew and wash a cup - it's scary to imagine what will happen at work.
I'll find a normal place for myself, without the HR layer, where you can talk to the head straight away.

The mattress is ideal for both a single person and a couple.
The latter will especially appreciate the presence of a stable surface and the absence of the "wave" effect, when vibrations on one side of the mattress can be transmitted to the opposite side, disturbing the sleeper.

If a fraudster calls from such a number, like a "police officer" or another law enforcement official, then it is ineffective to hang up immediately, and it is unlikely that you will have time to add them to your blacklist.
Because to confirm his lie about his connection to the power structures, he quickly repeats the challenge and continues to intimidate and persuade.
We need more useful recommendations for the people.
That's just rubbish...
I don't believe it happened at all.
They don't know what to do, who to blame.

It would have been easier to leave people alone from coercion, of course, if our people cared about their people.

And I can even smile for you.
But I remember that thought is material!

A film by Alexander Sokurov’s student won the European “Oscar” for best editing
The Russian film nominated for the Oscar “Unclenching the Fists” received an award from the European Film Academy (which is also called the “European Oscar”) in the category “Best Editing”, reports “Moscow Komsomolets”.
The competition jury, which voted online due to the difficult epidemiological situation, assessed the outstanding skill of the film’s creators.
The maximum number of awards was received this time by the film by Jasmila Zbanic (Bosnia) "Where are you going, Aida?"
The main character of the film is a translator for a UN mission who is trying to save her family during the war in Yugoslavia.
As for the film "Unclenching the Fists", directed by Kira Kovalenko (a graduate of Alexander Sokurov's workshop), this film tells about the difficult relationship between a powerful father and children who are growing up and want to break free from their father's control in North Ossetia.
The film was previously announced to be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film.
As the regular friendly meetings of the presidents of Russia, Azerbaijan, and Turkey show, you, to put it mildly, are not in the know.
Only yesterday, the President of Azerbaijan approved the opening of a joint Azerbaijani-Russian enterprise KamAZ.
