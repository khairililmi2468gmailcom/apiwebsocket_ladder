The big comeback of the Czech loser is approaching.
Pavel Francouz has been called up to the NHL
Czech ice hockey goaltender Pavel Francouz, who is going through a difficult period in his career, is returning to the NHL.
The thirty-year-old Pilsen native will be on the bench and could soon be in goal.
The former goaltender of Litvínov, Plzeň or the Russian Chelyabinsk was injured during the preparation for the NHL in October of this year.
He was benched in the middle of the game against Vegas and has not played in the NHL since.
The incident happened as the experienced goalkeeper moved from one post to the other.
"Pavel Francouz will be out for approximately three to four weeks with a lower-body injury," the Avalanche announced at the beginning of October.
His return to the NHL net ended up lasting more than two months.
He was called up from the farm on Sunday morning U.S. time, where he had caught four duels and showed his old form.
In the AHL, he made 94.5% of his saves.
The graduate of Plzeň hockey wants to finally break through and prove that he belongs in the best league in the world.
In the last season, he had hip problems and in the shortened pandemic season, he didn't catch a single game.
In the NHL, "Francík" played in 36 games, with a save percentage of 92.3%.
Charles in Christmas card with Camille's mask, William and Kate pose in Jordan
British Prince William and his wife Kate have chosen a family photo taken during a trip to Jordan as this year's Christmas card.
Prince Charles also shared his wish, using a photo of him helping his wife, Camilla, put on a mask at the races.
The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) reported this on its website.
Messages are sent to friends, colleagues and charities they work with.
The photograph was taken somewhere in a desert landscape.
The Duchess of Cambridge is dressed in a long khaki summer dress, as is Princess Charlotte.
Prince William, the Duke of Cambridge, is wearing shorts and a collared shirt, just like Princes George and Louis.
It is not clear who took the photograph or when it was taken.
Last year the royal family posed for their Christmas card photograph on a stack of straw in front of a pile of logs at their country home in Norfolk.
The heir to the throne, Prince Charles, and his wife Camilla also released a picture to serve as a Christmas greeting.
Photographer Sam Hussein caught him at the races in Ascot in June.
Charles, who has a cap on his head and a mask on his face, helps Camille put her mask on, which matches her light-colored dress.
According to efotbal.cz, Slavia has promised Berbr a million for the title, but Tvrdík denied it.
Prague - The investigators in the current corruption case are said to be working on the assumption that the accused former vice-president of the Czech Football Association, Roman Berbr, was promised one million Czech crowns by Prague Slavia for the league title in the 2018/19 season.
The website efotbal.cz reported this, stating that it had access to part of the police records.
The chairman of the board of the Vršovice club, Jaroslav Tvrdík, stated that the red and whites had not committed any corruption.
The website published transcripts of police wiretaps, in which the former sporting director of Slavia, Jan Nezmar, who left the championship club last summer, is the main figure.
The former influential official of the red-and-whites was, according to the file, in frequent contact with both Berbr and the former sports director of the then second-league Vyšehrad, Roman Rogoz, who is also among the accused in the case.
The police were reportedly working with information that Slavia had promised Berbatov a financial reward for winning the title.
In 2019, the SK Slavia Praha team won the first league title.
The police authority had the knowledge that Roman (Berbr) was promised a million-dollar bribe by the officials of SK Slavia Praha for winning the league, the server quoted from the file.
According to the criminalists, the following day Berbr met not only with Nezmar, but also with the chairman of the board of Slavia, Tvrdík.
According to the server, it is not clear from the report whether the police is still dealing with this information.
Tvrdík denied any corruption.
Between 2015 and 2017, we actively tried to change the situation in Czech football and we offered an alternative for its development.
We have never committed an illegal act, we have not tried to influence referees in breach of the fair play rules, and we have not paid any financial compensation to anyone in this regard," said Tvrdík for Seznam Zprávy.
In the recordings, Nezmar, among other things, indiscriminately insults some former dark-skinned players of Slavia, and also slanders his former boss, Tvrdík.
The case of alleged match-fixing through referees was sparked by a police raid in mid-October last year at several locations, including the headquarters of the Czech Football Association in Prague.
Berbr is the highest-ranking person involved in the affair and is no longer involved in football.
In mid-January, he was released from custody, just like former Vyšehrad Sports Director Rogoz.
Helicopters, tanks, and BVPs are the LARP of the Cold War.
The new tanks will be of a fundamentally worse type (the gunners will have to leave the armoured cabin and carry the ammunition by hand without protection).
The cars - Toyota Hi-luxes - are new and good
Trucks and various armoured vehicles - at a decent level, moreover, it is already possible to get rid of the Praga V3S even in specialised units.
Aircraft: combat - decent but at the end of its lease, transport - too small with a short range, but modern.
Drones - few and only small types with no combat potential
Rockets - we don't have any (but we manufacture them and export them abroad)
NGOs: Cold War-era, outdated; short-range: good, modern, relatively good number.
I have a story.
I have a hunting lodge right next to the city.
The nutria were coming out of the river and causing damage to the crops, so I sat there.
When I arrived, I could see that there was a fisherman on the other side of the river.
I didn't want to make a scene, so I sat down and the guy probably didn't notice me.
I hoped that he would leave before anything came out, but of course, the fox left after a while.
I let her get to 40 yards before I decided to shoot.
The poor fisherman almost had a heart attack, he was waving his flashlight in all directions, so I called out to him that it was a fox.
When I got off the saddle, I was black and blue.
In other words, a man can be a loser.
On the other hand, it's not a war. It would take a lot of coincidences for something to happen. You would probably be seen on a thermal camera, which almost everyone has today.
So in a visible place, put your expensive things next to your feet in your sleeping bag and you should be fine.
Vojtěch versus Hamáček.
The Ministry of the Interior obtained respirators significantly cheaper than the Ministry of Health
The state, responsible for the purchase and distribution of masks, masks and respirators for the professions closest to the coronavirus, has issued billions of crowns in the past weeks for their purchase.
The iRozhlas server compared the purchases of individual ministries and found that, during a single day, the amounts for respirators differed by hundreds of crowns.
Why did the prices fluctuate so dramatically?
Which authorities have acted frugally?
And why did others buy more expensive ones?
Lenka Kabrhelová talks to iRozhlas editor Dominika Kubištová.
I respect the soldiers and the army (I am probably not affected by the memories of the Czechoslovak People's Army that older generations experienced), but the Czech Republic cannot benefit from compulsory military service.
We don't even have large stocks of equipment that could be grabbed by the newly trained, we don't even have modern equipment for the current professionals, and on top of that, modern equipment is always more complicated, so the skills of the reservists will be rapidly lost over time.
To that, modern conventional conflicts, where anyone can be deployed, will play out very quickly, there will be no time to retrain anyone.
Finally, the reservists/territorial defence are of great importance for countries like Ukraine, where mass guerrilla warfare is conducted and it is also an explicit necessity for deterring the enemy.
In the Czech Republic, it will only work in a conflict of such size and intensity that guerrilla warfare will be irrelevant, and we do not have the right geography for that.
Mainly we don't have individual skills.
It's not even the worst of it.
The worst part is that half of them are playing like they have it.
Then you find yourself in a situation where you look like an idiot, who two minutes ago couldn't hit an empty net, and you drive into an attack on your own between 2 or even 3 Swiss players, and you ask yourself "what the hell do you think is going to happen now?"
Of course, they'll treat him like an average taxpayer.
The situation with this skill of "beating a defender" is so bad that I caught myself being genuinely surprised when I saw our attacker beat one of the opponent's players.
The first swallows
The Covid-19 pandemic is slowing down, but experts do not expect any major change in the coming weeks.
The pressure on hospitals will persist for some time, according to statistical models, and a new unknown has been added to the pandemic equation: the omicron variant, which is very likely to spread faster than the currently predominant Delta.
At the same time, it is not yet possible to say with absolute certainty whether it can cause a more severe course, to what extent it is helped by vaccination or post-infection immunity acquired from a previous illness.
This week, however, an unexpected phenomenon on the plus side entered the COVID equation: the possibility of treatment.
The new drug, the antiviral molnupiravir, has arrived in the Czech Republic. This reduces the risk of a severe course of the disease and associated hospitalisation by a third, and it is possible to be treated with it at home.
And soon, it should be joined by the Paxlovid drug from Pfizer, which from the current results reports a success rate of up to 85 percent.
The first delivery of molnupiravir to the Czech Republic has, in addition to the hope of expanding the portfolio of tools useful in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic, highlighted the question of how the Czech administration is prepared for the arrival of new drugs.
As mentioned, the first to reach Czech patients will be Merck's molnupiravir.
The company ended up at the front of the pack in part because the drug was in development long before the current pandemic began, with the goal of finding a treatment for a viral disease of horses in South America.
These studies often ignore the fact that people in the West (Germany, Sweden, etc.)
They tend to be less open and do not share their opinions openly.
On the other hand, Eastern Europeans, and especially we Czechs, are used to talking "as if a beak had grown on our nose".
See, you'll do a survey where you ask people if they like Muslims.
In the Czech Republic, most people will tell you that they don't.
In the West, they will tell you how much they like migration, how everyone should help them, and how we Czechs are racist scum.
And then they go and vote for parties like the AfD.
They fear cancel culture, saying this publicly means losing your job and being lynched by the media.
Then it looks nice in the polls, the West is good and the East is bad.
But they will find out what people really think.
In France, Le Pen and Zemmour both have more than 20%, according to polls.
We even know that there are three objects in Czech and they are completely identical.
Identical due to rotation of units, so the soldiers don't have to relearn where things are, all the buildings are exactly the same.
One of them is the Atom Museum of the Brdy, and the other two are abandoned.
It's funny that the USSR didn't want to have nuclear warheads on its own territory, either for security reasons or because of the speed of deployment due to its more western location.
In the underground bunkers (there are two in each maple tree), only the warheads were stored, not the entire missiles, as it is said.
If it was necessary to use this weapon, a special unit came to pick up the head and mount it on some kind of carrier.
In addition to the museum maple, the rest are in a dilapidated state.
In second grade of primary school we had a Gypsy classmate, and we spent 4 years with him.
He was pretty good, he made some good jokes, he was often a bit over the top, but he was like our mascot.
Everyone played with him, he often went and wanted to explain something, he was almost always there, he played sports with us, he didn't steal snacks or phones, he was dressed neatly.
He went to nature schools, did all sorts of monkey business, but he was fine, he never got into any trouble.
In 8th or 9th grade, the siblings enrolled in the same grade, but in different classes.
Shortly thereafter, they beat up the teacher, the police were often called there, they threatened and intimidated other students...
I sometimes sell things online (old stuff, things I don't need, etc.) and I've often sold things to Gypsies, they always had money, they didn't try to haggle with me over the price, and the communication was calm.
I've even sold a car this way, the guy called a month later to say he had already transferred it to himself...
I say myself that I'm not a racist; it doesn't matter to me whether someone is white, black, yellow, blue or something else, as long as they act as they should in a decent society (work, function, don't beat up women, just normal behaviour).
But as soon as someone comes, they stretch out their hand, they evict people from their flats and houses, there's just a mess around them, they cause trouble... it doesn't matter what colour they are, but it will bother me.
I have no problem with African migrants, as long as they participate here, start a business, work, learn the language (not necessarily, at least English), and respect our culture.
If they believe in Allah, I don't care, as long as they respect my traditions and culture, I will respect theirs.
A young woman died in a car accident in Prachatice
"The young woman suffered serious multiple injuries and despite resuscitation efforts, unfortunately succumbed to her injuries at the scene," said Zuzana Fajtlová, a spokesperson for the South Bohemian emergency services, to Právo.
The accident was probably caused by the driver who was taking the girl.
The 18-year-old driver of the Peugeot was probably driving from Žíchovec to Bavorov, and for unknown reasons left the road in a bend.
After the collision with the Skoda Octavia, the Peugeot ended up on its roof off the road, said South Bohemian police spokesperson Štěpánka Schwarzová.
The young Peugeot driver suffered very serious injuries in the accident.
It was multiple injuries and he was trapped in the car.
After being freed, he had to be given emergency pre-hospital care and was airlifted to the hospital in České Budějovice in a stable condition, stated rescue worker Fajtlová.
She added that the man in the second car suffered minor chest injuries and was taken to hospital.
New rules apply to parcels from outside the EU, customers often do not provide the necessary information
Lukáš Neuheisl orders from abroad several times a month.
He mainly buys collector's cards.
"Usually, it's tens of dollars, say from ten dollars upwards, where it's still worth importing, especially from Japan, where the postage is often free," explains the collector.
Since October, ordering small parcels has become slightly more expensive for him, he now has to add VAT, and has to give customs information to the post office.
He receives an email informing him that customs are awaiting the package's arrival.
Then all you need to do is fill in the details of the package, and if the trader did not include VAT in the sale, the customs authority will calculate it from the total amount for the package and delivery.
If the recipient does not handle the customs proceedings themselves, the carrier's fee must also be added to the total amount.
However, according to Lukáš Neuheisel, the whole process is not complicated.
I tick one or two checkboxes, attach two attachments and I'm done.
For me, it is usually a matter of five minutes, says Neuheisl.
Not all packages are delivered smoothly, however.
Due to new customs rules, the daily number of packages received at the international post office in Prague has dropped from 60,000 to 15,000.
According to Czech Post, the problem is also that people do not respond to requests for information needed to complete the customs procedure.
There are currently 30,000 parcels at the international post office, which we have to process.
If people would fill in all the information that is required, and fill it in on time, we would be roughly halfway there, says Czech Post spokesperson Matyáš Vitík.
The solution to inflation
See the title, how would you propose a solution to the current inflation?
Currently, we are at 9.9% inflation, and it is expected to rise further.
What do you think it should do to slow or compensate for this growth?
For example, in Poland, we have seen a reduction in VAT on food and PHM. Is this the way forward for you?
What do you think is going to happen that is inevitable about where it's going?
Prices are rising faster than wages and it's inevitable that people won't be able to afford basic things, especially energy.
How much did you get added (if you are an employee)?
I was given a 2% rise this year, which is a joke, but luckily I have a similar income from a business I run on the side.
Could someone explain to me why convicted violent offenders are only sent to jail for 6 months?
I just don't understand how the court can sentence such a beast to only 6 months in prison just to do it all over again as soon as they get out.
6 months is nothing compared to the fact that their victim will have trauma for years, negatively affecting their sexual relationships and relationships in general.
Not to mention the fact that a victim of rape may never get over it.
Will this not deter potential future rape victims from coming forward?
The man from Hrob "shot" his girlfriend from Kostomlat
The man from Hrob unwittingly helped the officers to secure his nationally wanted girlfriend from Kostomlat, who was the subject of an arrest warrant.
He summoned her himself.
However, he did so in an indirect way.
He first approached a passer-by and invented a story that he had been robbed.
After being called to the scene, officers were astonished when the alleged "robber" told them he had made the whole thing up to get them to come to the scene.
In fact, he just wanted to ask the guards how to file a report with the Czech Police.
After checking the identity of the man and his girlfriend, the officers discovered that the woman was on the list of wanted persons, in a nationwide search, and an arrest warrant had been issued for her.
The case is therefore being handled by the Czech Police.
A genuine question for people here: do you consider our country to be Slavic?
Personally, I believe that the Slavs are no longer ethnically or culturally, but I would be interested in your opinion.
Otherwise, I obviously agree with the meme, it's a shame that Churchill wasn't able to secure the liberation of Prague by the USA :')
Of course, I do not deny that we have a Slavic language.
I don't know, it's quite a question whether a rational person can really believe something without evidence just because it could potentially do good.
I would personally not consider such a case to be true faith.
I cannot agree with Pascal here: there are approximately, if I'm not mistaken, ten thousand different religions in the world.
Which god or gods should one choose?
I would say that it is quite likely that at least one of the thousands of religions has a god who will punish you badly if you believe in a different god.
However, the Ten Commandments state that there is no other god than Jahve.
In such a case, wouldn't it be more rational to refrain from believing in any god, rather than risk choosing the wrong one out of the thousands of gods, and the one true god that I didn't pick sending me to hell or some similar place?
Other: Voluntary training followed by inclusion in the reserves.
The Swiss model is somewhat similar.
X months of training (in various specializations, X months for each) and under the leadership of professionals with practical experience.
If you do well, you can get a professional offer.
Something like this would suit all branches of the Armed Forces of the Czech Republic.
It could be done in cooperation with the University of Defense.
We can talk about it like this: There is constant collaboration between the education sector and industry, companies are hunting for talent in schools and there is some kind of intermingling, where the workforce migrates from educational institutions to employment.
Not just in adolescence, but this process goes on all the time, each of us is constantly learning something new, moving from one field to another, etc.
Such intermingling should also work between the civil and military sectors.
I see it as a way of building a kind of relationship between a citizen and the army, i.e. an institution that ensures that we will never again be invaded by a Russian, a German, or a Mongol.
I find it funny that you consider NATO to be something carved in stone, we have allies and they will defend us if something goes wrong.
No, don't please the Lord.
It only takes one election in the US to twist their budget and the whole of NATO goes down the drain.
The British exchange us for Russian roubles, the Germans exchange us for Russian gas, and the Poles have already shown that all they need to do is turn their backs and take what they want.
The only thing that works as a long-term guarantor of independence is a heavily armed army and a population that is able to operate the military technology of the day.
Today, every teenager can pilot a drone, so why not.
We don't need border fortifications, it's useless today, but a savvy teenager with a remote-controlled device will be able to handle it.
How to not drown in a box tsunami
You unwrap the gifts under the Christmas tree, and all of a sudden you're home buried in boxes and packaging?
The "waste" is being re-used by online shops that are short of packaging materials.
A map was created of stores that will accept your used boxes.
And not just at Christmas.
All packaging materials are designed to withstand repeated handling.
That's why it's a shame to treat them as disposable.
Anyone can bring cardboard boxes, plastic or paper padding to the participating store (the map of the KAMsNIM.cz project contains almost 150 of them) by agreement.
This will support small businesses, reduce the amount of waste produced and avoid overflowing blue bins.
Shops themselves welcome the packaging, which is currently in short supply on the market, and also the saved money, as packaging cardboard has risen in price by 50 per cent in the last period.
In the eyes of customers with an ecological mindset, I am strengthening my brand.
One of these stores is TIERRA VERDE, a manufacturer of eco-cosmetics and eco-cosmetics.
The boxes and packing material are brought to us in Popůvky near Brno by individuals who have collected them at home, but we also hear from companies with whom we have arranged regular pick-ups of discarded cardboard.
We'll use everything when we pack orders from our e-shop.
Together, individuals and companies are creating a more considerate world.
Our wish is to preserve the resources and beauty of nature for future generations, says Petra Lopušníková from Tierry.
However, the www.KAMsNIM.cz application shows not only collection points for packaging waste.
It serves as a search engine, if you need to get rid of anything (where to take sorted household waste, where to drop off expired medicines, tyres, retired electronics, batteries, light sources, bulky waste, etc.).
All waste can end up in the right place, and in addition, reusable items can find their second home.
The project map already contains more than 100,000 such places.
"Over time, more and more collection yards, re-use centres, textile containers, food banks, charity shops, SWAPs and other places that help to find a use for things that would otherwise become waste are being added to it," adds Miroslav Kubásek, one of the authors of the application from the Ukliďme Česko association.
It seems wrong to me that today's technology is so simple and fool-proof that children who use computers or phones to play games don't learn basic computer skills.
Recently there has been an issue (mainly in English articles) that college students don't understand the concept of folders on a computer.
Because apps like Google Photos or Apple's Photos app, or really mobile phones in general, just hide the underlying filesystem with folders and put everything on one screen in the app.
They can use the technique from childhood, but most of all, they should learn something.
Let's rewrite history, seriously
Emmanuel Macron unveiled the priorities of France's EU presidency - starting in January - over the weekend and it was grand.
Macron spoke for over an hour, during which he revealed the logo of the presidency, called for the protection of Europeans - at work, on the street - and mentioned so many actions that they cannot be done in half a year.
French politicians love it, and so do the voters.
Macron's supporters who straddle the right and left agree on little, but on Europe they do.
And there will be new elections for the head of state in France in April.
The election calendar has also influenced the priorities.
The French leader, among other things, mentioned that historians should write "one history of Europe" and that France is ready to create the conditions for such work by historians.
A number of commentators were quick to criticise Macron's pro-European propaganda and rewriting of history.
In fact, they are trying to prevent the rewriting of history.
The far-right candidate for the French presidency, Éric Zemmour, is currently touring France with the thesis that the Vichy regime, which collaborated with Hitler during World War II, was not so bad, and he is doing quite well with the French.
Let's take Macron's idea of one history book seriously and not look at what's happening in France.
Is it needed?
In European countries, students often learn history as a story of us versus them and never as a story of the whole.
Spaniards, French and Czechs are learning who beat whom in which battle.
If they don't have a wise cantor, they won't learn the wider context of the event.
The film of the year is Quo Vadis, Aida?
The Czech "Mice" didn't win.
The film, which returns to the Srebrenica massacre of 1995, also won awards for directing and for best actress Jasna Duričić.
This year, it was at the top of the audience rankings at the Karlovy Vary film festival.
The best actor award in Berlin went to Anthony Hopkins for the film The Father.
I'm not very young, I'm not very healthy/fit and I'm not vaccinated.
It was kind of like "having the flu/being under the weather" I had diarrhea for a few days and didn't really feel like smoking...
It was worse than a common cold.
I don't have diarrhea with the flu.
(This is just my personal experience. I'm not saying that this is the case for everyone.)
Christmas book recommendations
The Christmas double issue, which comes out on December 20, will feature the traditional literary supplement.
Along with her, cultural tips will also come out.
We are adding these books to the digital edition for you, our subscribers, so that you will have enough time to buy the books as Christmas gifts.
The prose texts follow on from the previous collection of Petříček Sellier & Petříček Bellot.
Another helping of observations of the world and descriptions of ordinary things with extraordinary poetic awareness, depth and atmosphere.
In his second novel, photographer Šesták tried to capture the essence of a small town and Czech society.
It is a story of returning to one's roots, which turns out to be only a longed-for illusion.
The bohemist and comparatist transfers the fairy tale of Little Red Riding Hood into the setting of a contemporary village.
Her delivery of brutality outstrips the folk versions and escalates into a horror of emotional emptiness.
And that the path back to instincts is shorter than one is willing to admit.
The author's penultimate novel tells a much less sentimental story about returning from emigration than we are used to hearing.
Those who stayed and those who left know too little about each other to make it work.
Trains start to run according to the new timetable, in some places the operators have changed
From Sunday, trains will be running on the railways according to the new timetable.
The biggest change is the change of carriers on some routes, such as between Ústí nad Labem and Kolín, where instead of Czech Railways, RegioJet is starting to run.
For most lines, only the departure time will be changed, and in some cases, the route will be slightly changed.
There will also be dozens of new trains on the tracks.
The transport companies started selling tickets during the autumn.
Czech Railways plan to operate an average of 6,783 passenger services per day in the new timetable, including an average of 478 long-distance trains per day.
The trains will travel approximately 118 million kilometres during the new timetable.
In addition to domestic connections, the new timetable will also include routes to Germany, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Austria, and Switzerland.
The company will introduce dozens of new trains along with the new timetable.
The main new feature will be InterJet trains, which will run on routes from Prague to Cheb.
The transport company will send more new trains to northern Moravia and western Bohemia.
The transport company will also, as is traditional, raise the price of tickets next year, by an average of 3.2 per cent.
The railways factor in inflation into their tariffs every year.
The biggest change in RegioJet's timetable is the introduction of the R23 Ústí nad Labem – Mělník – Nymburk – Kolín line.
The carrier will replace České dráhy here following success in the Ministry of Transport's competition.
RegioJet will operate a total of 16 connections on the route every day, eight in each direction.
Other changes affect long-distance services between Prague and Brno, which from Sunday will also stop at Havlíčkův Brod, Žďár nad Sázavou and Kolín stations.
Leo Express kept its 16 connections, two return connections to Slovakia and also weekend connections to Krakow.
According to spokesperson Emil Sedlařík, the transport company also tried to keep the timetables of its long-distance trains as similar as possible despite the planned work.
Without major changes, the operation of Arriva trains and other carriers should also continue.
There will be a change of carrier on some regional lines as well.
Changes are in store for passengers, for example, in Českolipsko, where instead of Czech Railways, the Trilex trains of the German company Die Länderbahn will run on the line from Mladá Boleslav via Česká Lípa to Rumburk.
Passengers will also be able to use the unified rail ticket for the second year.
As with Czech Railways, their price will increase by 3.2 percent due to inflation.
I have to disagree.
Are we not supposed to learn to see things from the other person's point of view?
Everywhere we hear about how much they had to fight for their rights, how they were oppressed and had to work hard and die.
In my life I've never heard a lesson from the perspective of the slave owner or from that time, no one is defending it, just condemning it.
No one tells you in school that blacks often sold blacks into slavery and that they were often the worst slave owners.
No one will teach you in school that the colonizers often bought the land from the Indians; they will only tell you how brutally we, the Europeans, wiped them out, while they were killing each other long ago.
I spent some time in the USA as well, directly in schools, both in the north and in the south.
I have not come across anyone deliberately covering up facts, but I have heard before that it does happen and I think it's a problem, which I do not deny (e.g. WW2 atrocities are quite taboo in Japan).
My point was more that history isn't black and white and that we have a tendency to look at it through a modern lens without understanding.
History is not interested in someone's feelings, it is what it is, and I think it is a fatal mistake to judge without looking at things from that time.
On the other hand, we should learn from it and never repeat it.
By the way, while we're on the subject of the southern states, yes, the Confederate flag and famous slave-owners are quite popular there, on the other hand, they also had some successes and it seemed absurd to me to reject them.
Moreover, the North was not much better, as many people idealise it today.
And a lot of people also forget that not everyone in the South was a slave owner and a lot of things were also opposed to them.
I wouldn't compare this to the Russians, they deliberately leave out certain facts, they lie and manipulate, and our perspective doesn't even exist there (there was even a video on YouTube from a TV station where they cut off someone who started talking about our legionnaires and 1968).
What I found ridiculous in US schools was the rise of Marxism and the idealization of communism, something their country has never experienced.
Overall, I felt that at some universities it was terrible, those students were quite radicalized and the schools often supported them in that.
And when I imagine that these people will be much older one day, it makes me a bit sick to think that this could be the voice of the majority, because it is among the young and in the ruling elite.
I think that, for example, feminism has already achieved what it had to and it is no longer about the same thing, it has become radicalised.
Currently, those who have nothing to do with it and ignore basic biological facts are calling themselves feminists, as well as other groups such as LGBT, which leads to radicalisation on both sides, often leading to resistance even to quite reasonable things.
Moreover, the more radical one is, the more one is heard.
On the other hand, in conclusion, I haven't come across anyone who has condemned me for colonialism or slavery.
I rather came across bad geography, but that was mutual :D
Not because I don't like it here, but because, in my opinion, it's completely pointless.
Should I be proud of something I couldn't do on my own?
I also consider the concept of nationality as a whole to be redundant in terms of personal identity.
If anything connects me to people, it's interests, views on the world and shared experiences, not where we were born.
I'm not religious, but from what I know, I can tell you this: We have two Greek-Catholic parishes here, one is Ukrainian and the other is Slovak.
That Slovak priest is a really nice guy, his sermons are more about theology than politics, but then he always throws in some nonsense about the coronavirus, that everyone should be ashamed.
Then there is the Czechoslovak Hussite Church, of course.
Officially they are Protestants, but in reality they were born out of Catholic modernity and are effectively Catholics without a pope.
I know a lot of people who are Catholic but go to Hussite services, because it's theologically very similar, but the members tend to be more liberal.
They have a beautiful and historically very valuable functionalist church on Botanická Street.
Otherwise, St. Michael's Church on Dominican Square belongs to the Dominicans, and they even hold mass in Latin every Sunday at 3:00 p.m., as it was done before Vatican II.
The Bethlehem flame is in the Czech Republic, the scouts received it from Austria
Břeclav - The flame lit in Bethlehem, where according to the Christian tradition Jesus Christ was born, is in the Czech Republic.
However, the scouts did not drive to Vienna this time because of the coronavirus pandemic. In the morning, they received him from their Austrian colleagues at the Reintal - Břeclav border crossing.
They received it at the border last year as well.
The Bethlehem light is a beautiful Christmas tradition that we participate in as a troop every year and I look forward to it very much.
It is an honour for me to be chosen, said scout Amálie Budíková to the present journalists.
While last year the handover took place at the Mikulov-Drasenhofen border crossing, directly on the border bridge, now at the Reintal-Břeclav border crossing in the car park.
The scouts usually take the train to Vienna for him.
The distribution of the flame across the Czech Republic is not changing.
The scouts traditionally set off with the Bethlehem light by train first to Brno, where they will hand it over to the diocesan bishop Vojtěch Cikrle.
On Saturday, 18 December, scout couriers will take care of the subsequent distribution of light, travelling in selected express and passenger trains.
From them, the light will be taken over by local scouts or volunteers, who will then continue to spread the flame throughout the Czech Republic, even to places where there are no railways.
This year too, scouts must comply with the current measures to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.
It is going the same way as last year.
We recommend that both the delivery teams and the organisers of local events wear masks of course, try to keep their distance, keep their numbers to a minimum, refrain from singing together, in short, act in a way that is as safe as possible, described the spokesperson of the Bethlehem Light event, Zuzana Hrbková.
The tradition of the Bethlehem light travelling across Europe was born in 1986 in Austria.
The goal is to spread the idea of peace, friendship and harmony along with the flame.
The Bethlehem light is a symbol for believers of hope, a light that overcomes the darkness.
In the Czech Republic, the scouts and scouts have been taking care of its propagation for more than 30 years.
The action is supported by hundreds of volunteers, the flame is therefore also a symbol of altruism and human solidarity.
All the news, including a list of places where people can go to get a flame, can be found on the website www.betlemskesvetlo.cz.
I do not have an economic education, so I do not know the basics of economics which confirm that subsidies are a cancer of the economy, but I do not think that subsidies as a whole would be a problem.
The development of infrastructure, ecology (e.g. water retention), healthcare and education will put the money to good use, but I don't understand why the money is given to agriculture, industry and companies in general.
As mentioned, this produces unnecessary products and undermines the free market and the "natural life of a company".
I myself work in a factory where there are millions of posters on the corridors saying "xy financed/co-financed by project xy" and such a company is just artificially kept alive.
This is not support for a company that provides jobs for x people, this is a brake on development where this company is just holding on and taking away orders/employees from companies that could grow and be more productive after its demise.
Absolutely agree, it's horrible.
Even someone who was born in the internet age can fall into some kind of trick or trap - especially advertising.
I don't think I'm influenced by the internet ads, but then I get caught out by them anyway - it's just so sophisticated that you can't avoid it.
For this reason, I support the radical voices in the European Parliament who currently want to impose an absolute ban on programmatic (= targeted) advertising...
It's all a load of rubbish, says the classic - I would ban the internet.
I have a feeling that these viruses have their roots in (but mainly in point 1):
1. "I won't believe something that the majority believes and makes sense, I'm not a sheep after all, but I'd rather believe something that is less likely, it doesn't make much sense, but it's important that I have my own original opinion that I will claim is critical thinking"
2. "I won't believe everything the media says"
3. "I don't believe politicians"
TV has fallen out of love with the Christmas movie, with 200 premieres this year
Los Angeles - Cinemas, television stations and streaming platforms in the United States and other English-speaking countries have fallen under the trend of Christmas films and this year they are premiering a record-breaking more than two hundred of them for their viewers.
This was counted by the operator of the film database IMDb.
The genre of Christmas family and romantic films has scored with the public in recent years and has significantly increased the number of viewers, so more and more of these films are being made.
This year, four times as many Christmas films were made as in 2011 and twice as many as five years ago.
The IMDb database only counts those films that have the word Christmas in their title, so there are actually many more Christmas films.
The films people traditionally associate with Christmas have always existed.
In the Czech Republic, this period is mainly associated with fairy tales, and around the world, films such as Home Alone, It's a Wonderful Life and the classic Christmas story Life is Beautiful from 1946 are popular.
However, the real boom of Christmas films began in 2009, when the American cable TV network Hallmark came up with a special film series, the BBC server recalled.
Her "Countdown to Christmas" project at the time included four movies and was very successful.
This year, the network started its viewers in the Christmas mood as early as October 22 and will present a total of 42 Christmas films.
Competitor network Lifetime has 35 new Christmas-themed films on its schedule this year, and popular streaming services like Netflix are also contributing to the total.
"In this magical time, the story doesn't matter so much, it's important that there are a lot of Christmas trees in the background and that it's snowing," said Brandon Gray, the author of the book I'll Be Home for Christmas Movies (Na vánoční filmy budu doma), jokingly describing this genre.
"It's a form of escapism for the viewers and a way to feel a little bit of peace for two hours in the midst of all of this holiday madness and the madness of the world we've been living in for the last few years," Gray added.
According to him, for example, the Hallmark channel uses the same recipe for its films, which is uniform, but successful.
You have two people who fall in love, but then there's some misunderstanding about half an hour before the end, which is resolved and they kiss.
That's how it goes round and round, and as long as all the movies look and feel the same, people will watch one after the other, Gray adds.
Mazepin had a positive test for Covid-19, and will not take part in the final F1 race.
Only nineteen drivers will take part in the Formula 1 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.
Nikita Mazepin has tested positive for COVID-19 and will not take part in the final race of the season.
The Haas team will only send one Formula to the track.
In the last race of the season, he was aiming for a better finish than the 20th place he earned in qualifying.
However, Russian Nikita Mazepin of the Haas team will not take part in the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.
He had tested positive for Covid-19.
On the starting grid, there will only be nineteen cars, with Mick Schumacher, Mazepin's team mate, taking off from the last place, and Max Verstappen taking off from the first place, who will face Lewis Hamilton in a direct battle for the title.
According to Haas, Mazepin is doing well and does not show any symptoms.
Nikita is physically fine as he was asymptomatic.
She is currently in isolation and will follow the instructions of the relevant health authorities, with safety being the ultimate priority for all concerned," her representatives told formula1.com.
Haas will not, and cannot, send its reserve driver to the race.
The substitute would have to qualify or race in another part of the weekend.
The first racer is not dealing with COVID-19.
At the start of the season that has just ended, Kimi Räikkönen had COVID-19, and last year Sergio Pérez and Lewis Hamilton tested positive.

Gold, silver and 150 diamonds: the price tag of the most expensive sweater will astonish you!
It is a bit like a portable jewellery store and the creator put half a year's worth of work and all his savings into it.
"I had a vision of what I wanted to create, but not much experience. Sweaters were never worn much at home," admits Liban, who spent 3,000 hours on his work in half a year.
He bought the silk in Italy, the 24-karat gold thread in France and the 2000 decorative crystals were supplied by Swarowski.
The silver stars were then decorated with 150 diamonds.
"The base is wool and cotton, but the silk gives the sweater softness," the creator praises his work, which he does not recommend washing.
And it has another trick up its sleeve.
"I'm completely broke, I have to sell the sweater as soon as possible," admits Liban.
If successful, it will set a world record.
The previous most expensive sweater, sold five years ago, cost "only" 720,000 Czech crowns.

The government has approved the deployment of up to 150 soldiers to help Poland.
Surveyors, scouts and drone pilots could be sent as early as Christmas, with the mission approved for six months.
They are supposed to help their Polish colleagues to protect the border with Belarus and to build the planned fence.
Poland has officially requested assistance from NATO states in response to the months-long actions of the Belarusian regime, which invites citizens of Middle Eastern countries to its territory with a false promise of an easy crossing of the EU border.
British and Estonian soldiers are already operating on Polish territory.
Is the Omikron mutation spreading in South Moravia?
Hygiene is investigating another case of a child from Adamov.
"We have another suspected case of this variant in another child from Adam's, in the reception class.
Direct contact with previous cases from ZŠ Adamov has not been proven," said Ciupek.
Six cases appeared in the region this week.
"We are still awaiting official confirmation of the variant in our six cases - it is being carried out by the National Reference Laboratory for Influenza and Non-influenza Viruses of the State Institute of Public Health in Prague," said the director.
She added that it involved two nurses from the same workplace at the Faculty Hospital in Brno and two children of one of them, as well as two 11-year-old pupils of the Adamov elementary school.
There is no connection between the cases in Brno and Adamov.
According to the director, three of them have mild symptoms and four have an asymptomatic course.
No one with suspicion of Omicron has traveled abroad
None of them had traveled abroad, nor had anyone in their families, nor had they come into contact with anyone who had been abroad.
There is no connection to the water polo championship for any of those mentioned, said Ciupek.
The chief hygienist Pavla Svrčinová previously stated that an international water polo tournament held in Brno a few weeks ago is being investigated.
There were players from South Africa and one Belgian player who got sick after returning.
California limits gun sales.
It wants to follow Texas in banning abortions.
California Gov. Gavin Newsom on Saturday announced a plan to ban the sale and manufacture of some firearms in the nation's most populous state through a legal mechanism used by Texas in its controversial abortion law that bans the procedure once a fetal heartbeat is detected.
People would then have the right to sue anyone who makes or sells assault rifles or homemade guns in California.
Newsom's announcement came in response to a Friday ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court that allowed Texas' abortion ban to remain in place, despite going against a nearly 50-year-old precedent that established a nationwide right to abortion up to about 24 weeks of pregnancy.
However, the court was not ruling on the constitutionality of the entire law, but on a technical issue that arises from the innovative design of the measure.
In this case, enforcement of the ban was shifted to the public, making it impossible for Texas Republicans to challenge it through the usual court process.
"I am outraged by yesterday's (Friday's) decision by the U.S. Supreme Court to allow Texas' ban on most abortions to remain in place and to largely uphold Texas' scheme to protect its law," the California governor said.
"If states can now block review of their laws by federal courts, then California will exercise that power to save lives," Newsom continued.
He reportedly tasked his subordinates to work with the state parliament and the minister of justice on measures that would allow public representatives to enforce a ban on assault rifles and so-called ghost guns.
These are home-made weapons without serial numbers that can be used to circumvent regulations.
Newsom wants "private citizens" to have the right to seek damages of at least $10,000 (over 220,000 CZK) and court costs from anyone who manufactures, distributes or sells assault weapons, "ghost gun" parts or kits to make them in California.
"If the most effective way to keep these deadly weapons off our streets is to create a private right of action, then that is exactly what we should do," the California governor said.
AP notes that California has banned the manufacture and sale of some military-style weapons for decades, but a federal judge blocked the state's ban in June as unconstitutional.
If the state were to now truly reinstate the ban using the Texas template, it would confirm the words of liberal Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who in a dissenting opinion to Friday's majority ruling warned against expanding the legal mechanism to other U.S. states.
The Supreme Court, however, did not grant Texas's abortion ban full immunity from judicial review, allowing abortion clinics to continue to sue certain officials in the southern U.S. state.
Each emergency vaccination has its own public testing phase, where the vaccination schedule is gradually determined and the vaccines themselves are improved based on the results.
For example, studies on the effects of the fourth dose are already rolling in from Israel.
And according to these studies, most patients see a five-fold increase in antibodies, which has the long-term effect you mentioned.
Just like any other vaccination, it will have its own vaccination schedule, but it is too early for that now.
Another fact is that a new vaccine, based on an inactivated virus, should be on the market soon, which, according to the manufacturer's specifications, promises up to 10 times greater efficiency.

Poland threatens to block EU budget payments
According to Ziobro, the European Commission would have acted in breach of the law if it had used its new powers to suspend payments to Poland due to the dispute over the rule of law.
The Commission has already delayed approval of Poland's plan for spending 36 billion euros from the EU fund for the recovery of economies affected by the Covid-19 pandemic.
And it is under pressure from the European Parliament to move forward and use a mechanism to withhold EU funding from countries that violate the rule of law.
"Poland should respond to this blackmail from the EU with a veto in all matters that require unanimity," said Ziobro, head of the small Solidary Poland party, without whose votes the current government would lose its narrow majority in the lower house of parliament.
"Poland should also consider its obligations in the EU's energy and climate policy, which lead to a sharp increase in energy prices," added Ziobro.
If the dispute continues, I will demand that Poland stops its contributions to the EU.
It would be justified given the fact that the EU is illegally denying us funds from the common budget to which we also contribute, added the Polish minister.
His party's stance on the EU is more radical than that of the ruling Law and Justice party.
According to the European Commission, the changes to the Polish justice system during Ziobro's time in office threaten its independence and subordinate it to politicians.
According to Ziobro, Brussels is setting "impossible conditions, because its goal is not the rule of law, but a change of government in Poland".
Warsaw is facing a "political dictatorship carried out through blackmail and an attempt to undermine the democratic decision of several million Poles," Ziobro also said.
He said that Poland should be a member of such an EU, which is based on the partnership of sovereign states, and not on the rule of the strongest and the Brussels bureaucracy, which is not under democratic control.
He said his party would never accept such concessions from Brussels that would limit the sovereignty of Poland.
"We will never agree to Poland's status as a colony," he declared.
But getting to grips with it... We have one type of cheese in four different places at Lidl.
I didn't look for other things, I met one yoghurt more than once, I just needed cheese, parmesan, after ten minutes at the dairy shelves I gave up and asked.
They had it, that's true, in that narrow sector there were all the selected, less common and special cheeses, but it was between the vegetables and the lactose-free zone...
If I avoid it, I don't even want to smell a supermarket, action or no action, the golden shop on the square, they may not have such a wide selection there, but they usually have everything I need, and it's all in some kind of order, so I'm done in ten minutes.
I went to Lidl to buy my holiday.
And I don't care anymore.
For two years, I've watched as data has been handled here like manure, and most of the anti-vaxxers are just a little bit off the mark compared to most of the pro-vaxxers.

Phew, I'm relieved.
I'm sorry for the rant, and I wish you all a nice day.
In my childhood, they punished me with a wooden spoon.
It was never because of marks, it was mostly because I repeatedly refused to listen and misbehaved (read instead of going to bed, argued with my brother, etc).
At the same time, I have never been punished without warning, my mother always first threatened that if I did it again, I would get a spanking (sometimes even after another "scoop" of the pan, she would only bring it and put it down so that I could see it).
Only after I repeatedly refused to listen, did I get a couple of spankings (through clothing).
Personally, I think physical punishment (in a reasonable manner and to a reasonable extent) is beneficial as a child responds to it much more than words.
I think the important part is the warning section, because it gives the child a choice of whether or not to disobey and get the punishment, or to improve and not get the punishment.
I was usually only given a warning before I started to listen.
Defence of the system
When prominent Czech lawyer and constitutional judge Vojtěch Cepl answered a journalist's question in 1999 about what the Czech constitution meant to him - whether it was a sacred document to which one swore allegiance and which was taught in school from an early age, or rather an agreement that could be changed if necessary - he certainly favoured the first interpretation.
Once, we agreed in the constitution on the democratic rules of our life, which, at the same time, define who we are as a state and its citizens, and we should be careful with changes.
And imagine this: Some nations even like their rules.
Just like the Czechs love dumplings with pork and cabbage, Vojtěch Cepl commented at the time.
Recently, however, there has been an increasing opinion among lawyers that the Czech Constitution needs to be changed.
Year after year, it is tested by situations that its creators (including Vojtěch Cepl) could not predict, for example by the behaviour of the directly elected president.
However, Cepl was right about one thing.
All we know about such documents shows that political interventions in their texts must be well thought-out.
The Institute must be understood and actively defended, only then can it be the key to overcoming most of the crises that societies have faced throughout history.
The constitution is, among other things, a set of rules of governance, which set the boundaries of the game for politicians.
We fear that power will be abused against minorities or individuals, so we tie the hands of politicians with prohibitions.
At the same time, the constitutional texts also allow politicians to exercise their power.
Covid does not discriminate, several-month-old baby fighting for its life in Brno University Hospital
Even though it is known that the coronavirus is milder in children, there are also severe cases, which the hospital is mainly dealing with lately.
"We know that children are less at risk and less affected than adults, with 2 to 5 per cent compared to adults," said the head of the Clinic of Pediatric Anesthesiology and Resuscitation at the Faculty Hospital Brno and Faculty of Medicine of Masaryk University, Petr Dominik, to Novinky.
The course is often much simpler, lighter, and often without symptoms.
But there are child patients who are severely ill with the coronavirus, which we can see especially in recent times," added Dominik.
According to the doctor, there are dozens of children who need mild supportive care.
It takes place at a pediatric infectious disease clinic.
Only recently have very seriously ill children with coronavirus been admitted to the ICU.
Children with post-Covid syndromes have been in the ward continuously throughout the year, according to the doctor.
"Now, we're seeing an increase in kids with acute COVID pneumonia, that is, pneumonia that requires admission to an intensive care unit," he said, adding that the illness affects not only adults, but also teenagers and even infants as young as a few months old.
There are also children in critical condition due to the coronavirus in hospitals.
"At the moment, we have a child of several months and an adolescent," said the head of the department.
However, she is pleased that the children's hospital at FN Brno has not recorded any child deaths due to the coronavirus.
According to available data, six children aged 0 to 14 years died in the Czech Republic by 6 December.
According to Dominik, a psychologist is an integral part of cooperation in a children's hospital - not just in the COVID-19 department.
At the same time, it points out that just like in adults, vaccination in children also reduces the severity of the disease and at the same time reduces the occurrence of the post-COVID-19 syndrome.
"That's why we recommend the vaccine dose for children," added the doctor.
In the rest zone, you can only walk along designated paths.
But those quiet zones aren't all that big.
They can be seen on the tourist map on mapy.cz.
In general, in national parks outside the quiet zone, you can walk anywhere (but don't climb over the fence into the game reserve).
Skiing/mountain biking in the forest off-trail is not allowed anywhere, unless you have an exemption (but of course it is not monitored much outside national parks).
How does a conductor practice?

He works with the Hradec Králové Philharmonic Orchestra, the Film Philharmonic Orchestra or the Podkrkonoší Symphony Orchestra.
China is creating the impression that it has contained the outbreak and that an authoritarian regime is better able to deal with a crisis.
Sinologist Jirouš: China is building up the impression that it has the epidemic under control and that the authoritarian regime is coping with the crisis better.
China has launched a health and political offensive.
Just a few months ago, Beijing was on the receiving end of criticism for failing to contain an outbreak that has turned into a global pandemic.
Now the country is reporting no new cases.
Countries including the Czech Republic are competing for Chinese protective equipment and Chinese doctors are helping to fight the coronavirus in many places, including the worst-hit Italy.
How do you see Beijing's willingness?
Is it friendly support or is the communist regime trying to improve its image in the world?
A friend meets a friend and says: "Do you want an elephant?"
I have it, and it's great.
The wife is happy, because it mows the grass, washes the car, and the children play with it.
No, it's just great.
If you want to buy an elephant for 5000, I'll sell you one.
Friend: Well, I'll just pay for it, it'll be great...
After a while, they meet again and the one who bought it complains: you bastards, what did you sell the elephant for????
The lawn is trampled, there are giant piles of manure everywhere, the car is broken, the kids are scared of it, and the wife wants a divorce.
The one who sold it says: You speak badly of the elephant, you won't sell an elephant like that...
World affairs are controlled by the great powers.
Despite the equality of sovereign states, it is the great powers that determine the course of international affairs.
Europe can become a superpower only if it works on its integration.
This currently works on an economic and political level (in selected issues), but military integration is still missing.
Personally, I think Europe is heading towards federalisation.
It won't be 10, 15 or 20 years from now.
But in the middle of the century, the mood will be different, and it will work.
I also thought of it, and it's quite possible.
I am not an expert in Czech, so I might be wordy.
I'm just going by the fact that an ellipse usually includes 2 different units on the same level.
I will use an example from another comment "Spanish oranges and mandarins", where it is clear that they are both from Spain, whereas with "Spanish fruit and mandarins" it is not clear that the mandarins are from Spain.
And I base that on the fact that the statement says "all American forces," which includes their weapons, and I know that American facilities are only operated by Americans.
In other words, I expect that it is already included in the broad term and there is no need to further specify it for US forces.
But again, maybe I'm just wordplay-ing :D
Be that as it may, it is a ridiculous request

British Vicki Holland tortured capuchin monkey Milly
The shocking footage shows the moment the terrified monkey cowered in a toilet bowl before its heartless owner flushed it and laughed at it.
Holland also fed the monkey hot dogs, kebabs, and hamburgers, regardless of its actual nutritional needs.
The Gwent magistrates' court has now banned her from keeping animals for life, The Sun reported.
The primate rehabilitation experts caring for Milly after her abuse said they had never seen such a terrified astronaut.
Milly spent nearly two years in rehabilitation with staff at Monkey World in Dorset, and is now happily playing with another rescued monkey called Moon.
The mother-of-four admitted two charges of causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal.
She was given a 12-week prison sentence, suspended for one year, at Gwent Magistrates' Court.
Holland was also sentenced to 120 hours of unpaid work, given a lifetime ban on keeping animals, and must pay 12,000 Czech crowns in court costs.
Leader of the Small Monkeys team who rehabilitated the abused animal, Steph Sawyer, said: "Milly is doing well, but the rehabilitation will continue."
Milly took a while to get used to people again.
She cowered and hid from everyone she met and any loud sound or sudden movement caused her to scream.
The monkey refused to eat for a long time.
Even now, when she has settled down and is happy with her mate, the sight of new people can still send her into a panic.
The mental scars of the abuse will stay with her forever, adds Sawyer.
The abuse of Milly came to light after Gwent Police discovered the horrific images on her phone during a drugs raid on her home.
In the footage, Milly can be heard using vulgar language.
On another video, Ms. Holland can be heard offering cocaine to the monkey and saying, "You want some cocaine?"
So lick my fingers.
In May she and her partner Russell Cox (43) pleaded guilty to possession of cocaine with intent to sell.
Cocaine with a street value of £1,600 (approximately 50,000 Czech crowns) was found hidden in Kinder eggs in her home.
Cox was jailed for 30 months and Holland received a suspended sentence of 20 months.
And what amazing concepts will you learn from the Stone Age three times in a row when you bravely skip the entire 20th century?
As if you get the same things in first grade as in sixth grade?
And the whole thing kills the idea of passing, where no one, with the exception of a few people, cares whether you can do it or understand it.
First of all, write a test for 1, and then no one cares.
Go out on the street and randomly ask people whether they can determine the nature of the roots of a quadratic equation and its coefficients.
Everyone goes through it, and the vast majority won't even bat an eye and will tell you they don't care at all.
So why are they learning it?
I'm a big fan of the general overview and the reality is that people don't want it and don't need it.
And at that point, it's futile and you will never get it into them anyway.
Part of it is learning for all the people who will need it.
But as for the note saying that you don't need any of this while standing by the machine, I meant it absolutely seriously... ...because you really don't need it.
Also, we are slowly getting to a time when not knowing is a mark of punk.
(Which is probably due to our communist past and the fact that we've always been angry at the educated and the elite) But the price of having barbarians standing by those machines is just too high.
If the journalists were able to count, the coronavirus probably would not have reached these dimensions here.
Wedding at first sight: The war between Kadri and Andrey continues!
Which is the main reason why Switzerland can't leave right now," replied Andrea in her Instagram Stories to the all-encompassing questions from curious fans about what disappointed her about Kadri so much that she decided to end all contact and even block him on social media.
From the beginning of the experiment, Kadri and Andreu have been at each other's throats.
The main problem was the fact that Kadri lived and worked in Switzerland, and his idea was that Andrea would move there, at least until he moved back to the Czech Republic for good.
However, she resolutely refused.
As it turns out, their relationship didn't end in love, but rather in mutual disrespect and even hatred.
It was your planned attack! retorted Kadri in reaction to Andre's accusations of lies, gambling and debts.
The alleged honesty of Kadri did not please his ex-wife, nor his younger sister Linda.
She decided to publicly stand up for her brother.
Normally I don't talk about things like this, and in my family we didn't talk about these things much either.
I certainly don't want to stir up any feelings of pity.
But when I see someone trying to publicly hurt and tarnish the name of someone I love so much, I just can't take it!
I am sorry that I have to do this in this way, but I would like to publicly thank my brother Kadri for being a character and helping our family when we needed it the most despite his young age.
I'm even more disappointed when I have to read such false information, which is probably taken out of context.
I would like to wish everyone to know Kadri like I, our close friends and family, stand in testimony in response to Andrey's words.
I'm so grateful to him for everything!
Of course people will believe what is written, but the most important thing is that we, his family, love him above all else and know the truth and know how it really was, she added vaguely.
A drunk thief climbed up the facade to the fifth floor.
You won't believe what it's for.
Chao began his crime spree in a residential neighborhood parking lot, where he attempted to break into several vehicles.
According to available information, he eventually stole less than CZK 330 from one vehicle.
He couldn't think of anything better to do than to climb to the fifth floor and climb into the apartment through an open window.
There, he stole two bananas.
The security camera footage then shows him walking down the street from the scene of the crime, eating a banana.
When the apartment owner woke up in the morning, he discovered the bananas were not where they were and called the police.
She was then detained by Cchaa.
The man admitted that he drank some alcohol on the day in question.
And since he needed money, he decided to rob in a drunken state.
It's all under investigation at the moment.
A drunk climbed up the facade to the 5th floor, where he stole two bananas.
The pandemic law is time-limited and its effectiveness is linked to the state of pandemic preparedness.
When that is repealed, the law will no longer be in effect.
The law does limit the scope of the business
Is that not enough of a reason for you?
The right to assemble will be restricted, but not abolished.
Over 60 per cent of voters turned out for the Saturday elections to the councils of four municipalities
People elected new councillors on Saturday in the municipalities of Komňa in the Uherskohradišť district, Lužice in the Most district, Nová Ves in the Liberec district, and in Rovné in the Pelhřimov district.
The number of councillors in these towns has fallen below the number set by law, or the elected council has collapsed.
A total of 99 candidates competed for 28 seats on Saturday.
The average age of the newly elected representatives is 46.7 years.
The oldest of them is 69 years old, the youngest is 33 years old.
The processing of the results of Saturday's elections symbolically closes a rather demanding, but successful year for us.
Four new or repeat municipal council elections and, above all, the closely watched elections to the Chamber of Deputies were held, said the Deputy Chair of the Czech Statistical Office, Eva Krumpová.
She reminded that due to the Covid-19 epidemic, the elections were more demanding in terms of equipment and personnel security.
The Association of Independent Candidates won Saturday's elections in Komňa in Uherskohradišť, with 27.76 percent of the vote and two seats in the seven-member council.
The STAN candidate received 24.84 percent of the vote, which also means two mandates.
Občané pro Komňu also won two seats in the council, receiving 18.52 per cent of the vote.
Jana Křižková, the former mayor of the village, who is a member of the Soukromníci (Privateers) party, was also re-elected to the council.
Komňans achieved one seat in the council as independent candidates.
75.48 percent of eligible voters showed up at the ballot boxes.
In the village of Rovná in the Pelhřimov district, the Pro Rovnou association won.
It received 50.50 per cent of the votes, which means four seats out of seven.
Two representatives from Association of Independent Candidates 1 and one from Association of Independent Candidates 2 were also elected to the municipal council.
Voter turnout was 93.62 per cent.
The repeated elections in Lužice on Mostecku were won again by the Association of Lužice and Svinčice led by Mayor Jindřich John.
It received 56.73% of the vote and, like in 2018, has four seats in the seven-member council.
The second place went to Obec pro lid, which received 43.27 per cent of the votes, and will have three representatives in the council.
76.7 percent of voters went to the ballot boxes.
The independent candidates Naděje pro Novou Ves won the elections in Nová Ves in the Liberec Region ahead of the ANO movement.
59.88% of voters voted for the association of independent candidates and won four seats in the seven-member municipal council.
ANO got 40.12 percent of the votes and strengthened compared to the regular elections in 2018, gaining one more seat and now has three.
Voter turnout was 42.9 per cent.
The State Election Commission will discuss the election results on Monday.
They will then be published in the Collection of Laws.
What do you think is the bigger problem?
A dead civilian or a foreign politician?
I think you know all this stuff that people are writing here.
You are just playing dumb to have someone to "argue" with.
If not, it's sad.
I'm not saying Christians are degenerates, or anything like that.
In fact I like a lot of church buildings from an aesthetic point of view (which of course was the point, to make them look good).
And I don't really care who believes in what.
On the other hand, I find it disturbing how much power the church had in the Middle Ages, how much money it raked in, the suppression of science, etc.
Not to mention all the wars it has caused, e.g. the Thirty Years' War
Tl;dr: Believe in spaghetti monsters if you want, but the state and church have nothing to do with each other
The man fell head-first from 12 metres.
He survived the crash into the concrete.
An incredible fall was survived by a man in Ostrava on Sunday night, who was attended to by rescuers from the Regional Medical Rescue Service.
At midnight on Saturday, the county's emergency operations center received a 911 call with initial information about a man falling from a height.
Two emergency services crews were immediately dispatched to the scene - a medical crew and a paramedic crew.
On arrival at the scene, paramedics discovered that the 27-year-old man had fallen out of a window from a height of about 12 meters and landed on his head on the concrete!
Coal was caught in Vítkovice.
But not as it should have been, and the firefighters went into action.
When emergency services arrived, the man was unconscious, with multiple injuries and in a life-threatening condition.
The attending physician intubated his airways, ensured artificial lung ventilation, and after further measures as part of pre-hospital emergency care, the ambulance transported him to further care at the Ostrava trauma centre, reported the spokesman for the ZZS MS region, Lukáš Humpl.
I'm more worried about the public and government's inadequate reactions than the coronavirus
The spread of the coronavirus in the Czech Republic is a challenge for politicians and officials, but doctors and health care workers are in the front line of the fight against the infection.
How serious is the situation from their perspective?

Legendary Nunes fell after seven years, Oliveira defended the belt
MMA saw a great gala evening full of interesting results.
Things happened at UFC 269.
The underdog Julianna Peña managed to beat the legendary wrestler Amanda Nunes, who had not been defeated for seven years.
Charles Oliveira did not hesitate in the lightweight division, put on a great choke against Dustin Poirier and defended the belt.
Also victorious was Kai Kara-France, who quickly swept away Cody Garbrandt with a technical knockout in the first round.
Sean O'Malley also beat his opponent.
A surprise no one expected.
This was brought about by the women's bantamweight fight between the famous Amanda Nunes and Julianna Pena.
The American entered the mutual battle as a sort of "dwarf", as Nunes had not lost for seven years and was sharpening her teeth for another triumph.
The start of the duel was in line with the paper expectations.
Nunes started the fight actively and sent her opponent to the ground with a push kick.
However, Penny was not to be outdone and tried unsuccessfully to attack using a lever on her arm.
The second round was gripping and very tense for MMA fans.
Both fighters landed a lot of great punches and hard hooks.
Peña then took Nunes to the ground, where she began to strangle her.
She had to give up the effort and fend off the attack.
The American woman shocked everyone when she became the new champion.
The main event of the evening was the battle between Charles Oliveira and Dustin Poirier for the lightweight title.
In the beginning, Poirier had the upper hand, but the cards gradually started to turn against him.
In the second, Oliveira tried to be more active, trying to lock his opponent's arm.
He didn't do very well, but then he created a lot of pressure, got his opponent to the ground and pummeled him with a series of blows.
This allowed him to win the second round.
In the third round, Oliveira showed a rear naked choke, which Poirier resisted for a while, but then had to tap out.
The Brazilian thus defended his title, while Poirier lost after two years.
In the next match, Sean O'Malley achieved a sovereign triumph, landing a hard right to the back of Raulian Paiva's head in the first round.
He then knocked him down with a series of well-placed blows to record his 15th victory.
Kara-France then defeated Cody Garbrandt.
Nunes celebrated another triumph with her little daughter in the spring, but now, after seven years, she has lost.
That hip, or this hip?
At first glance, it doesn't seem complicated.
In Czech, most nouns express only one grammatical gender, so there is no problem in determining whether it is masculine, feminine or neuter.
Then there is also a fairly large group of nouns for which the gender is not fixed.
Such substantives oscillate between two genders.
When inflected, they take on double endings, and in some cases remain in the uninflected form.
For example, words such as "svízel" or "kyčel" are both masculine and feminine, in the first one they are declined according to the pattern of "stroj" and in the second one according to the pattern of "píseň".
Another group of nouns have different forms in the first singular case, for example: „řádek/řádka“, „kedluben/kedlubna“ or „brambor/brambora“ (in the sense of food).
Both forms are standard, have the same meaning, and are therefore freely interchangeable.
Some terms can differ from region to region, for example "okurka" in Bohemia and "okurek" in Moravia, but in this case the Moravian version is non-standard, and the same is true for other Czech-Moravian word pairs: "příkop" and "příkopa", "kobliha" and "koblih", etc.
Some words that have entered the Czech language from other languages were originally uninflected, but they are gradually taking on Czech endings.
A typical example is the word "image", which is both masculine and feminine, or the word "buffet", which has remained in the middle case without inflection, but in the masculine it has endings according to the pattern of "castle".
Turkey opened the way for migrants to Europe.
What does the situation look like on the Greek border?
The Greek-Turkish border is tense with a growing number of migrants trying to make their way further into Europe.
Thousands of people have been heading for the southern edge of the Schengen area after Ankara stopped holding them back.
European politicians are promising Greece support, and the Czech government is also preparing humanitarian aid.
What really motivates refugees to make the perilous journey?
What does the situation look like on the ground?
We haven't seen a blue sky in three months and we're suffocating, says Sydney-based journalist
The devastating fires plaguing Australia for the past four months have killed nearly 30 people and hundreds of millions of animals and destroyed millions of hectares of land.
How are the local authorities and the people themselves dealing with the disaster?
Could the Morrison government have done more to prevent the harsh effects, as critics claim?
And what does the country have to prepare for in connection with climate change in the future?
Lenka Kabrhelová spoke with Sydney-based journalist Ika Detrichová.
False allegations have always been and remain relatively rare.
That is why everyone is always written about everywhere.
It's uncomfortable for people to look at what sexual violence looks like in our society and how widespread it is, so they try to silence it.
I don't personally know anyone who's been falsely accused.
I know a lot of people who have been raped and I've seen how the people around them and even the police often treat those people.
Victims should always be believed.
It has become a trend for victims to finally open up about their traumas.
However, too many people still keep it to themselves.
Yes, there are those who falsely accuse someone.
It is disgusting and spitting in the face of all victims of sexual violence, but by spreading the idea that "a large proportion of allegations are false" and that it's a "trend" you are only helping sexual predators.
Scattered houses flood the Czech Republic, families do not have the money to finish them
The price of building materials has risen by more than 30 per cent in recent weeks and months.
This has put a lot of people in a difficult situation.
She does not have the means to complete the family houses she has set up and banks are refusing to increase her mortgage loans.
In addition to the cost of materials, the cost of building work is also rising.
People therefore do not have enough money to complete the family homes that have already been set up.
In many cases, banks are refusing to increase their mortgage loans, creating an extremely uncomfortable situation.
At best, people move into makeshift and unpermitted homes.
In the worst-case scenario, the scattered houses are uninhabitable and families are forced to sell them because they cannot afford to pay both the mortgage and the rent," says BHS economist Štěpán Křeček.
We build two to three family homes a year and fifty per cent of the time it happens to us.
It's difficult for us as a construction company because we have to comply with certain things in the contract, even if the materials have become more expensive.
So we are doing it for free," said Zdeněk Slivoň, the owner of a construction company.
A lot of people are just going to have financial problems.
If they calculated that the construction of the house would cost five million, now it will cost seven.
I think some will wait," added Slivoň.
The most expensive materials were copper, iron, and also plumbing and heating equipment.
Construction firms are also battling a shortage of labour.
There is a shortage of construction graduates in the Czech Republic and the influx of foreign workers is being held back by the pandemic.
Only the situation regarding the issuance of building permits is more favourable at this time.
"Building authorities issued 7,675 building permits in October, which is almost 10 percent more than last year," said Křeček.
We are doing well and we will do even better.
It is missing a real vision, says a Czech Radio - mujRozhlas commentator
In addition to traditional celebrations, the start of the new year has traditionally been accompanied by political speeches.
This year, in addition to the Prime Minister and ANO leader Andrej Babiš and the Christmas message from President Miloš Zeman, the presidents of the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies also addressed the nation.
What did we learn?
I think the master's thesis is great, I have my own topic that I have chosen, I build on my bachelor's thesis, I always work on it for a whole year and then I write the written part in a week or two.
The state exams are completely calm here. If you're not a total monkey and something has stuck in your head, then the commission won't needlessly suffocate you with theory.
For example, I studied for the state exam for a week and when I was exhausted, the committee always tried to guide me to some logical conclusion, which I immediately understood and I was right.
Otherwise to those projects, I know people who pay someone to do their semester project for them (we did it a lot, it's really beneficial, you learn a lot) and then they just learn the project and they're set.
In my opinion, it is great when there is an exam at the end of the subject that reflects the knowledge gained as part of the project, not just a defense.
All well and good, but don't clog up the email and phone lines and don't send any packages to the embassy.
You will be just like them.
Those people at the embassy may not have anything to do with it.
And if they were against Russia, they would be taking a lot of risks, so maybe they have to play with them, because otherwise something could happen to them.
But you could just as well put up a similar statue of Putin next to the statue of Pú the bear.
However, it could be given in such a way that it would reach Xi Jinping's backside, or something like that.
I agree, even though Instagram is throwing artists under the bus.
If you don't post stories every day and a new picture at least every other day, your reach will be reduced to the bare minimum.
Plus, it keeps changing which function is more important, whether it's a like, comment or save.
I've been really upset about it recently, so maybe I'll have to come down to TikTok, where a lot of artists in my industry have success and they can't get enough of it.
I'd even be happy if something more user-friendly came along that didn't suck all the creativity and energy out of artists
A statement from the Workers' Party of Donbass
The Union - yes, the dissolution - no, say the opponents of the dissolution of the Soviet Union in the picture.
Thirty years since the illegal dissolution of the USSR.
On December 8, 1991, the largest geopolitical catastrophe in human history took place.
On December 8, 1991, Boris Yeltsin, Leonid Kravchuk and Stanislav Shushkevich, without any legal authority and in violation of the results of the referendum on March 17, 1991, with the open tolerant attitude of Mikhail S. Gorbachev, secretly, without regard for the people, signed an agreement that “the USSR as a subject of international law and as a geopolitical reality ceases to exist”.
With one stroke of a pen, they "erased" a huge country with almost three hundred million inhabitants.
With the collapse of the USSR, tens of millions of ethnic Russian citizens found themselves abroad.
Russia's population has fallen by ten to eleven million since the early 1990s.
Even without the loss of the non-Russian population of the former Soviet republics we've already lost more people than in both world wars combined!
Earlier, the same people, who in one sitting in the Belovezhskaya Pushcha forest destroyed what had been built over the previous seventy years, betrayed the socialist camp (created at the cost of millions of lives in the Second World War and in the Great Patriotic War).
They deliberately de-industrialised, they slowed down agriculture, they broke away from the largest world power, fourteen republics that were previously economically linked in a single mechanism.
If we look even deeper, we see the impoverishment of the population, the collapse of the economy, science, the military, the rise in crime, inter-ethnic conflicts, the war in Chechnya, all conflicts in the post-Soviet space, a series of Orange Revolutions, the expansion of NATO to the east, the war and the collapse of Yugoslavia, the Arab Spring, the war in Syria - all of this is the result of geopolitical capitulation, first of the socialist camp, and then of the Soviet Union.
There is such a concept in political science as "power vacuum".
Everything that was hastily betrayed and given up was quickly filled and conquered by the NATO countries that accepted our geopolitical capitulation.
And the whole world is still shaken by the events of the end of the 1980s and the beginning of the 1990s.
The price of a product sold in a major supermarket does not necessarily correspond to its quality and quality.
It is Monday, and we have some meat in the supermarket that costs 189 CZK/kg.
I buy it with the intention of putting it in the fridge and making it into dinner on Thursday.
In an alternative reality where I don't buy the meat on Monday, the chain will discount it to 99 CZK/kg on Tuesday - describe to me the mechanism by which the change in the price of the meat turns it into a burden for my digestive system?
Or I could wait until Thursday and the meat will be discounted to 69 CZK/kg one day before the expiry date - how would this meat differ from the one I bought on Monday for 120 CZK more and left it in my fridge for 3 days?
I will answer myself - with nothing.
These things about the fact that when something is cheap, it must be definitely bad, spoiled or low-quality are really retarded, to tell you the truth ;-)
Recently, I went to Hlavas in Brno, and in the underpass, a lady was handing out some brochure, I always take similar things to help the volunteers, they can't throw it away...
No, the brochure was full of common sense and conservative views on how the world works, but there was nothing about God, I was confused, but I thought it would be some kind of agitprop.
After reading it, I found out who published it and it turned out to be Scientology.
No, it was a good matron, full of completely unnecessary advice, like that I should wash myself and not be a rascal.
It's a shame about the paper, because the rainforests wouldn't have to be cut down for it.
I've experienced something similar with an ex-girlfriend.
Psychological manipulation and emotional blackmail will force you to comply with that person because you love them, without realizing how messed up the situation is.
She threatened me several times to hurt herself because I went out to chat with a friend she didn't like.
Or when I wanted to leave her apartment earlier, she started crying and begged me on her knees not to leave.
She then physically blocked the door.
It was a great relationship for about a year, but then another six months passed and it started to beat her up.
After that, I ended the relationship by telling her that I was breaking up with her, but that we could talk about it again next week to calm her down and prevent her from having another fit.
Such a person will drain you of your feelings, emotions and joy in general.
It's better to keep your distance
When insurance companies are going crazy buying up test kits and hunting down positives who wouldn't have known they had this terrible disease if it wasn't for the test.
The only thing we are achieving is complications for companies, transporters and others, because five days of home confinement fell to their employees in the random number generator.
In the west, they have stopped with the scaremongering and recognise that it is not worth dealing with a disease weaker than the famous flu.
Unfortunately, Válek is new and he has to steal something and boost his ego by making up nonsense.
I see that our old friend the scoundrel is returning.
After years of decline and suppression of this illicit business, MLM recruiting is back in the spotlight.
I was one of the recruits, I tried it (I was 20 years old, a first-year university student), the initial promises of product training and business skills quickly turned into "it doesn't matter to you, just get people".
I was genuinely interested in the products I was selling as I wanted to help people, but the training was more about how to scare and coerce people.
When the first earned money came, one quickly realized that in order to make money, one had to sell a certain number of products every month.
Investment life insurance and mortgages were the only profitable things, so you felt like a door-to-door pot seller.
All I can say is that it was a valuable experience, one learns not to jump on every piece of information and to verify it thoroughly.
At the same time, I wouldn't lump everyone together.
There are people in this business who are successful and even helpful to people, but they certainly won't be boasting about expensive consumer goods or a "fat" bank account.
I haven't seen many things like this in the corporation where I work.
HR is at peace, the managers look after their management, and they don't stick their noses into anything.
Regular assessment is done somehow, in the form in which it takes place here, it works quite well (set some goals for the next year, in a year we will see what worked and what didn't) - it's more self-assessment than someone assessing you based on some numbers, and similar.
Company outings are also not mandatory.
But we're a bit unique even within our company - there are departments that are more "corporate".
Sometimes it feels like we're a quasi-startup, squatting in the offices of a large corporation.
But it doesn't bother us much as long as the results are good.
Missing Czech woman in Britain is dead.
Her body was found in London.
British police have been searching for a missing 32-year-old Czech woman for nearly ten days, who disappeared at the end of November.
On Sunday, December 12, former foreign minister Jakub Kulhánek announced on social media that the woman from Uherské Hradiště had been found dead.
The British police unfortunately confirmed to our diplomatic mission in London this afternoon that they have found the body of the missing Czech citizen.
The cause of death is being investigated.
We will not be releasing any further information on the case out of respect for the family.
My sincere condolences, wrote Kulhánek on Twitter.
The young woman was last seen on November 28 in a bus on her way home from work. Before getting on the bus, she was supposed to withdraw money from an ATM.
Her colleagues at work reported her missing five days later.
She was then wanted by the London police, and Interpol put her on the list of the world's most wanted.
She also appeared in the Czech database of missing persons.
Police have already arrested one man in connection with the case.
What role it played in the case and what it is suspected of has not been made public.
At the end of the year, new councils were elected in four towns
On Saturday, 11 December, new representatives were elected in the municipalities of Komňa in the region of Uherskohradišť, Lužice in the region of Most, Nová Ves in the region of Liberec, and Rovná in the region of Pelhřimov.
The number of council members in these municipalities has fallen below the number set by law or the elected councils have collapsed.
In the new election, 99 valid candidates competed for 28 seats.
Voter turnout was 62.41%.
The highest turnout was recorded in the village of Rovná, where 93.62% of eligible voters voted.
Eight women and 20 men won seats.
The average age of the elected representatives is 46.7 years.
The oldest is 69 years old, the youngest is 33 years old.
In total, 13 candidate lists were registered for the new elections to the councils in the four municipalities.
There were 36 women and 63 men running for the 28 council seats.
The average age of candidates was 46.6 years.
The youngest candidate was 22, the oldest 72.
Processing the results of Saturday's election symbolically marks the end of what has been a challenging but successful year for us.
Four new or repeated municipal council elections took place and, above all, the highly watched elections for the Chamber of Deputies.
We had to work in more difficult epidemic conditions, which placed greater demands on equipment and personnel, said Eva Krumpová, First Deputy President of the Czech Statistical Office.
The last polling station was counted at 3:49 a.m. on Sunday, December 12.
The State Election Commission will discuss the results on Monday, and once approved, they will be published in the Collection of Laws.
This is the biggest problem I have with the whole pandemic.
It took me a while to come to terms with the fact that we had a very dangerous infectious disease here, but it went without major problems.
What I still struggle with is the way in which a large part of the population, at all levels, has reacted so idiotically to it.
I am most looking forward to the vaccination (tomorrow!) because thanks to it, I will finally be less dependent on the fact that other people are not assholes.
He would be removed from the office of President and disqualified from ever holding it again.
However, as others here have mentioned, the chances of this actually happening are very small.
Moreover, I'm not sure whether the cartography of the file could even be considered treason.
Velezrada is such an act by which the president of the republic endangers the sovereignty, territorial integrity, or democratic character of the state.
It had to be something more serious.
How the pandemic has affected intimate life: the number of people under 35 who have not had sex for a whole year is growing
More young adults in the U.S. are living their lives without sex.
It is mostly religious people, says the DailyMail website.
The survey found that the proportion of people aged under 35 who abstained from sex rose from eight to 21 per cent between 2008 and 2021.
Women between the ages of 18 and 35 who say they haven't had sex in the past year are more than ever before.
Other factors have also contributed to the decline in sexually active individuals, according to a survey by the Institute for Family Studies (IFS).
One of them could be the economic effects of the coronavirus pandemic and a higher percentage of unemployment.
But the presence of the media, social networks and video games, which make sex less and less of a priority for young people, may also have contributed.
"Between 2010 and 2018, the share of 18- to 35-year-old men and women reporting no sex in the past year has been growing rapidly," said IFS researcher Lyman Stone.
People in married relationships are more likely to be sexually active, with just 5% of them reporting no sex in the last year in 2021.
It was 29 percent among the unmarried. Stone added that marriage under the age of 35 is only a small percentage.
The decline in sexual activity is also due to the fear of premarital sex and religious beliefs.
While married couples are more likely to be sexually active, the proportion of married and cohabiting men and women aged under 35 is still falling.
Young people's opinion on premarital sex is divided, with about 30% thinking it is a bad thing, while about 70% think it is okay.
"It's true that they're a minority among free-wheeling individuals in this age group, but their behavior is shifting the trend," Stone said of the 30 percent.
Most of those who have a moral problem with premarital sex do so for religious reasons.
Since 2008, the rate of abstinence among singles under 35 who attend religious services more than once a month has risen from 20 per cent to almost 60 per cent.
Among the "less religious," the trend rose from 10 to 20 percent," Stone said.
The decline in sexual activity is also attributed to other factors, such as less social interaction and especially the social drinking of alcohol during the pandemic.
The study also found that the likelihood of sex is lower for people who are unemployed or have lower incomes.
Another reason could be the expansion of digital media, which apparently reduces the need for sex.
People are spending more time online, which is "replacing" this need.
This trend has caught on especially during the lockdown period of the coronavirus pandemic.
The entire COVID vaccination mandate is about whether society should force a portion of the population to behave in a way that they don't want to, but that could save their lives.
It's a pretty tough question, but I'm personally most interested in the question of social conscience.
For example, the question of whether it will be our fault if we don't tell them to do it and they die.
My argument is that we could have certainly been responsible for the death of an 80-year-old man who really didn't know very much, we didn't explain it well to him, he heard some misinformation, and as a result he didn't get vaccinated and eventually caught it and died.
On the other hand, I don't think we can blame the death of a determined anti-vaccination campaigner who shouts alongside the SPD and the Communist Party here about bullying and a totalitarian state.
From the statistics I mentioned, it can be quite clearly inferred that most of the unvaccinated pensioners probably belong to the second group, so they will be able to pay for it themselves.
The Czech Republic without snow.
How will a mild winter affect the fight against drought?
This year's winter has brought one of the smallest snowfalls in recent times in the Czech Republic.
Ski resort operators cannot do without artificial snow and the weather complicates the preparation of the Jizerská 50 cross-country ski race.
Is it a trend or an exception?
And what will the lack of snow mean for the fight against drought in the Czech Republic?
I have one story, but it doesn't have anything to do with the plate-licker.
One time in middle school, our teacher took us across the whole city to the boathouse so we could go boating on the river.
On the way there, we walked along a fairly wide street and in the middle of it we saw a devotee of the Hare Krishna sect.
Naturally, they came down on us.
I was lucky enough to get away, but one of my friends got into a conversation.
When she left them, we asked her and the teacher what she said to them.
"They asked me if I wanted to save my soul.
I told them that I don't have a soul," she replied.
We all, including the teacher, laughed all the way to the boatyard.
We are very pampered.
Not much is happening, but the system is collapsing, says Orozovič
New German Chancellor Olaf Scholz arrived in Warsaw on Sunday after previous visits to Paris and Brussels, where he was greeted with military honours by Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki.
"We are opening a new chapter in our relations," Morawiecki said at a joint press conference after the meeting.
Scholz stressed that Europe must make it clear together that it will not accept a violation of Ukraine's territorial integrity.
The chancellor believes that the crisis, caused by the alarming movements of Russian troops near the Ukrainian border, should be solved through diplomatic negotiations, including within the framework of the "Normandy group", which brings together France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine.
Morawiecki said he had informed the chancellor about the situation at Poland's border with Belarus, where leader Alexander Lukashenko has deliberately created a migration crisis and is using people as human shields and weapons, because we are recording hundreds of attempts to (illegally) cross the border every night.
I talked with the Chancellor about further sanctions to make the Lukashenko regime and its patrons in the Kremlin understand that we are determined to defend the eastern border of the EU.
According to the DPA agency, Scholz assured that Warsaw enjoys German support in the dispute with Belarus, and condemned the inhumane treatment of refugees by Lukashenko's regime.
Drunken Polish nun caused an accident, tried to cover it up
The car returned to the scene of the accident after a while, but it was driven by another nun who was trying to take the blame.
When the police told her that she could still lose her driver's license for failing to yield and fleeing the scene of the accident, she came clean, TVN24 reported.
She admitted that another nun had hit the car and asked her for help.
Then the police came for Celestine's sister.
She was breathalysed and then, when it was discovered she had more than two times the legal limit of alcohol in her blood, her licence was immediately revoked.
At the same time, they informed her that she will be questioned about her actions in court.
The dog, Hugo, is doing his best.
However, Juraj Šajmovič didn't keep an eye on his film.
Czech creators of family comedies have looked to American stories about dogs.
However, they forgot one important thing: the laws of the film business.
After the kitsch film F. Brabec's Gump - The Dog Who Taught People to Live, another film is now vying for the audience's emotions in cinemas, Here We Guard.
Co-writer and director in one person Juraj Šajmovič Jr. freely builds on his previous film Tady hlídám já from 2012.
Returning to the scene is the talking Dachshund, Hugo, along with some familiar characters around him.
Julie and Ivan, the owners of a dying pension in the Šumava mountains, start to invite dog walkers, Julie's father and his partner and most of all her daughter Veronika.
She's no longer a little girl, but a young woman experiencing her first love.
The director and his partner, Beatriz Shamovich (who is also the film's producer), struggled with storytelling techniques in their previous dog film, but at least that one entertained children and a dog.
This time, the creative duo wrote an even weaker script, which evokes a mixture of disgust and feelings of embarrassment.
Let's recap.
Despite being a scientist, Julie succumbs to the darkness of superstition in her desire for a child, and when the right "constellation" occurs, she copulates with her forest engineer, Ivan, anywhere the coordinates dictate - on the hood of a car or a church tower (of course, during an ongoing excursion with a local guide), the retired Colonel Mojmír, despite years of training, shoots his own daughter (Julie) in the forest, who falls into a coma, whereupon she is taken from the hospital by her family, so that a miraculous healing process can take place in the heart of the Bohemian forest with the help of a dog.
Nothing against the cleansing power of nature and the power of animal companions.
Their owners know why they have them.
However, the viewer is amazed at how much content, full of implausible situations and characters, was required to convey this message.
A pair of thieves from the staff, a dog show competition, a South Bohemian charlatan, police officers arriving on a tip to search for "drugs" and discussing herbs over the fertilizing power of bone meal - and, of course, a family that gets drunk in the pension.
When the protagonist, after a long coma, sits at the family table, made up and with a cigar, and demands her father's whisky and a steak as a recovered vegetarian, you can't help but laugh.
On top of that, the creators explain to the viewer that "this sometimes happens after a coma".
Šajmovich's team lacks basic dramaturgical knowledge of working with the text, the ability to build up main situations, a sense for the characters' traits and the point, and directorial guidance.
The acting is uneven, the editing aimless, and the overall impression muddled.
Despite the best efforts of Lukáš Vaculík, Jitka Ježková, and Nela Boudová to keep their parties going, they don't have much to play with.
The only positive aspect of the film remains the poetic shots of the Šumava nature by cameraman Vladimír Holomka and the two dachshunds.
It's not enough to outline a few characters, a flimsy plot, and dog puns, not to mention the more common vulgar words the characters use.
Long-standing membership in the Club of Dachshund Breeders - as in the case of the lady producer - is not an argument either.
For good intentions to promote nature and the friendship between man and dog, one must also have knowledge of the craft, if one wants to tell a believable story.
This did not happen in this case.
There is a bit too much eroticism and a minimum of feeling for the genre in the good family photo.
Even as a commercial for canine therapy, this amateurish piece wouldn't pass muster.
Yes, respect, because they have to listen to constant insults from idiots just like you.
There is a difference between offering and forcing, here you can see how little you understand it, but that is only because you have never tried it.
The decision is always up to the customer, if they don't want it, the answer will always be no.
If you listened to those kids all the time, you might change your mind.
It's a job like any other, in this case a job for extra income.
The Middle East is experiencing unusually dry months.
Winter is the only time of the year when it rains.
"Almost complete absence of rainfall during November, as recorded at some stations, is unusual," the Israel Meteorological Service confirms.
For example, the village of Kfar Giladi in northern Israel reported just six percent of its long-term average rainfall for November.
This week's two-day rainfall was therefore more of an exception.
It's good for us.
It hasn't rained for a long time.
It is also the right Christmas backdrop, rejoiced Nazareth resident Wasim Aškar.
Precipitation in Israel comes almost exclusively in the winter months, is sporadic and irregular.
Forests are dependent on winter rains.
Without them, they dry up and are prone to fires.
It's not just forests, but also drinking water supplies and irrigation for farmers.
Israel's largest freshwater source, the Sea of Galilee, filled to the brim this spring, thanks to three consecutive rainy winters.
Since then the level has been falling.
Water managers have been warning of drought for a long time.
"It is expected that as a result of global warming and climate change, there will be less precipitation here," said Uri Schor, a spokesperson for the Israeli Water Authority, in 2018.
Israel is able to help itself with technologies such as desalination or waste water recycling.
Economically weak countries such as Lebanon, Syria and Jordan are faring worse.
In the streets of Jordan's capital, Amman, water tankers are becoming more common.
The public water supply and private wells are drying up.
"This year I've had a 70-80 percent increase in orders compared to the previous two years," tanker truck driver Imad Suleiman said in September.
In Iran's Isfahan, clashes broke out between farmers and security forces.
The reason for the protests was the drought.
The bed of the local river was completely dry.
The region has experienced one of its driest Novembers in recent years.
Israel prepares military strike against Iran
The Israeli defense minister said the talks in Vienna brought "no progress" and that he had informed Washington of the preparations for an attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.
Defense Minister Benny Gantz declared on Saturday that he had ordered the Israel Defense Forces to prepare for the possibility of a military strike against Iran, reports Jonathan Lis.
Gantz, who is in the United States, is trying to convince the Americans to step up pressure on Iran, but he also informed Washington about the military preparations.
During a press conference in Florida, Gantz said nuclear talks in Vienna have not made "any progress" and world powers "understand that the Iranians are playing with them."
This happened to me about 3 years ago.
I flirted with the lady a bit and grilled her during the conversation to find out what she actually wanted from me.
I eventually discovered that my suspicions about the pyramid were justified.
Because I really don't like these tricks, I asked the lady a few more questions and finally thanked her and left.
Feel free to tell me I'm a jerk, but a pyramid is a pyramid and financial advisers are financial advisers.
Skiers headed to the mountains over the weekend, where they found plenty of snow and nice weather
Ski resorts in the Czech Republic experienced their first major influx of skiers this weekend.
After the heavy snowfall at the end of the working week, there is no shortage of snow, and some ski resorts have opened as a result.
The downhill skier was not deterred by the requirement to show a Covid certificate at the lifts.
While the tow operators aren't complaining about a lack of customers, some ski rental shops are reporting lower demand for their services than before the pandemic.
Thousands of people took to the cross-country ski tracks and ski runs in the Liberec region over the weekend.
Skiers enjoyed the weather, which offered sunshine and excellent snow conditions today.
"We are satisfied, the opening weekend really started with Friday evening skiing, when we had the first skier on the hill," the director of the Ještěd Sports Area, Jakub Hanuš, praised the interest.
Hundreds of people headed to the Jeseníky Mountains for the first weekend of skiing in the new season.
For example, Ski Aréna Karlov and the centre in Branná in Šumpersko were open.
The weekend attendance was very good, with an estimated 400 people on Saturday and today.
The conditions are great.
Today, the sun was shining and it was about three degrees below zero, so it was perfect, said Rostislav Procházka, a representative of the Branná ski resort, who did not spare the praise.
Ski resort operators can only sell lift tickets to people who are vaccinated or have recently recovered from COVID-19.
With the exception of a few, people are prepared for it and show the required documents, said René Hroneš from the Špindlerův Mlýn ski center to CTK.
"We've only seen a handful of incidents," he added.
Some ski rental and equipment stores are reporting lower interest than before the pandemic.
Fortunately, there is interest in renting skis.
It's not like in previous years, but there are still enough customers, said Alexandra Bokišová from the Skiopava store in Opava.
It is expected to be busier during the ski season.
David Šinták, a representative of the Královéhradecká company Snowbear, also feels that due to Covid, people are not as interested in renting ski equipment as they used to be.
At that time before the pandemic, we were almost on loan.
Compared to the period before the pandemic, we are at about 50 percent, Šinták told CTK.
People, according to him, have become lazy during the pandemic and have learned to sit at home.
In contrast, the rental shop in the Novako area in Boží Dar is experiencing high demand.
They started renting out skis a week ago, and interested parties now have to order them in advance.
"We're starting to rent skis this weekend, but people have already been calling in advance, so we expect a lot of interest, just like last year," said facility operator Pavlína Nováková.
According to her, the interest in ski school is also comparable to the period before the epidemic.
If we want successful and wealthy people to stay in the country, they must have the opportunity to live a quality life as they would abroad.
Socialist health care, where it is often difficult to find a dentist or specialist doctor, is definitely not included.
The smart and capable people who have no property are leaving the country.
The owner of the company doesn't just up and leave for abroad.
However, I absolutely agree with the rest.
If these people do not have a good life in the Czech Republic, and if these people do not see a reasonable future in the Czech Republic, then they will not live in the Czech Republic.
Emigration from Hungary began when one beautiful day, Orbán won, he ruled for a year and suddenly the annual emigration rose by a few tens of thousands.
It is naïve to think that the Czech Republic cannot find itself in a similar position from one day to the next.
Another question is whether there will be elections at all.
When things are going badly, a traditional V4 madman can also win here.
The young and educated will leave, leaving his supporters and people whose property doesn't fit in an airplane.
Frightening picture!
Langmajer in the blood for a beer bet?
While autumn was in full swing in the Czech Republic, the Island film crew headed by Jiří Langmajer (55) enjoyed the tropical weather in Thailand!
The actor posted a bloodied photo of his face on social media.
Is it a real injury, or is it make-up for filming?
London police are still looking for the missing Czech woman.
She was last seen on her way home.
"Petra's disappearance is completely out of character and we are becoming increasingly concerned for her," said Lucy O'Connor of the Lambeth police station where Ms. Srncova worked, in a Saturday video.
"Her family in the Czech Republic is also very worried about her and just wants to know where she is," she continued.
According to her, the missing Czech woman left work around 19:45 on Sunday 28 November and headed home to Camberwell.
She was last seen getting on a bus about half an hour later.
Her disappearance was reported on December 3 by one of her colleagues.
According to British media, Srncová worked as a "nurse's assistant" at the Evelina London Children's Hospital, which is part of the Guy's and St Thomas' hospital group.
"We have grave concerns for our dear colleague Petra who is missing," the group of medical facilities said in a Twitter post.
"We would like to encourage anyone who may have any information that could assist in finding her to contact police," the statement continued.
MP Harriet Harman urged the public to come forward with information about the case at a press conference on Saturday.
"She's been missing for a few days, she's only 32 years old, she's from the Czech Republic, her parents are understandably distraught," the Labour politician said, holding up a photograph of the woman distributed by London police.
"I feel like we all have a particular responsibility to try and find her because she was away from her home country, she was away from her family and she was working here for our health care," Harman said.
Police have previously arrested one man in connection with the case, who remains in custody.
However, the BBC reports that police have not released any information about his identity or what he is suspected of.
Russia is not capable of occupying Ukraine, and certainly not with 30 BTG (i.e. approximately 5 divisions).
I don't underestimate Ukraine either.
These are not "huge amounts," but about 8 percent of the Russian army.
Notice that Ukraine is constantly repeating that we are exaggerating the threat of an invasion and is getting fed up with our presence.
I quoted above.
I don't know where he got the idea that Russia wants war.
War is a hell of a lot of fun, and Russia has the GDP of Italy.
The comparison to 1938 is so far off in so many ways that I don't even know where to begin.
I can now compare it to the First Punic War and the "annexation" of Sicily :D
I can imagine that after Ukraine announced that it would not respect the Minsk agreements, Russia would annex those ridiculous republics.
That's all there is to it, and that's what the "concentration" at the borders would correspond to.
Yes, pacta sunt servanda...
New timetables come into effect in Prague from Sunday, mainly affecting suburban services
Passengers on the Prague integrated transport system (PID) can expect several changes from Sunday, which will affect mainly suburban connections.
New lines have been created, some have changed routes, and others have been discontinued.
Mladoboleslavsko is now joining the integrated system.
In the capital, from Sunday, express trains from České Budějovice stop at the Zahradní Město station.
The S7 suburban trains will run on the route from Beroun to Český Brod, passing through Prague Main Station.
The newly opened station in Prague-Zahradní Město will now be served by the R17 express train from České Budějovice and Benešov.
The PID is expanding into other areas.
Among other things, the buses will travel to Světlá nad Sázavou, Blatná near Jesenice, Staré Splavy and Turnov.
Buses in the Mladá Boleslav region will be included, including lines with connections to the Liberec and Hradec Králové regions.
During the integration, 77 lines will be abolished, 37 new lines will be introduced and the operation of 12 existing lines will be adjusted.
A new bus line 405 will depart from Prague's Zličín, travelling all the way to Žatec.
A new direct connection between Prague and Kralovice near Rakovník was also created, replacing the discontinued S53 train line.
There will be strengthened connections from Prague to Rakovník in the morning rush hour and on weekends, with a new express line number 404.
Lines 400 and 410, which run to the Liberec region, have now been included in the PID system.
They depart from the Střížkov metro station, not from the Holešovice train station.
Spine line 400 runs through Mělník, Dubá and Česká Lípa to Nový Bor and selected connections continue to Rumburk or Cvikov.
The additional line 410 runs from Mělník and Dubá to Doksy, Mimoň and Jablonné v Podještědí.
In contrast, the operation of dozens of local lines in Central Bohemia has been cancelled or restricted, including those to Mochov, Dobříš and Rožmitál pod Třemšínem.
All trains leaving Prague at 02:30 have been cancelled.
Long-term restrictions on the lines from Prague to Beroun, Prague to Lysá nad Labem and in the vicinity of Kolín will continue as a result of railway modernisation.
Travellers will also be affected at other locations.
Buses are replacing some of the cancelled train routes or the section of line 420 from Dobříš with connections from Prague, where it is possible to use PID tickets up to Milevsko.
The routes of lines 540 to 543 in Nymburk have been changed, and the routes of some buses on the border of Central Bohemia and Hořovice in the Pilsen region have been adjusted.
Healthy snack/lunch for the office from the supermarket
Hello, I do the normal 9-5 with a 30min break and my only option to get food is to go next door to Billy's or a bit further to Lidl.
Since I don't have any movement, I don't have the energy to exercise after work, so I have to eat as healthy and diet as possible.
Unfortunately, I never know what to buy and in a hurry I buy at most a pizza roll, and for a snack I buy a yogurt and an apple.
What would you recommend me to buy in a supermarket that is healthy and does not need to be cooked?
Not everyone is waiting for a meter of snow like you are, unfortunately.
And it's not just trees you need to see.
Only the top of the Christmas tree can be hidden under the snow.
If injured, the tree may be more susceptible to fungal diseases.
I'm not saying it's the only reason why they don't allow us to ski off-piste, but it's one of them.
Dara's admission about her relationship with Nedvěd: I wasn't looking forward to this at all
The Czech showbiz pond has been alive with nothing but the revelation of the relationship between Dara Rolins and Pavel Nedvěd since Friday.
They've been together since the summer, and the famous footballer even got a divorce because of the singer.
Dara has now sent a lengthy message to her fans, in which she explains why she kept her love a secret from them for half a year.
"I dare to say that there is currently no one in the Czech Republic or Slovakia who does not know that Dara has caught a bear, i.e. pardon, Nedvěd," jokes Dara Rolins, who is head over heels in love with the most successful Czech footballer.
But it was he who packed her up, not the other way around.
Three days are the centre of attention, and although they are used to public interest, they do not enjoy it.
And here it is.
What we both didn't look forward to, but we knew it would happen one day, the singer continues.
I just don't know who has it worse.
Whether it's those who don't care about it at all and it jumps out at them even from a can, or us, whose lives they dissect in minute detail.
As if someone wanted to hear your opinion on whether you fit well with your husband or partner, or if you insisted that everyone should know a detailed list of your ex-partners and be aware of a list of your mistakes and faults.
That's a żużo, that's what you want, Dara doesn't like it.
The couple got together in Italy, where Rollins was traveling for the preparation of her new fashion collection.
Nedvěd has been there for a long time as vice president of the Juventus football club.
They only went public with the truth now, because they were waiting for Nedved's divorce to be finalised.
He has been separated from his wife Ivana for three years, and they have only been officially divorced for three weeks.
However, we thank those who rejoice with us and wish us well.
We are just people, we have families, children, pasts and dreams.
We're not perfect, but I think we both have our hearts in the right place.
I love my new man, and just like him, I stand by him. In good times and in bad times, concluded Rolins.
Hello, the other commenters have probably already said everything important, I just confirm that the dormitories are great to start with, my fellow students usually got to know each other and became friends during the first semester or two, and then found flats to share together, which I think is the best option because you know who you will be living with.
The apartments are usually not advertised very far in advance, so you probably won't find much now, but it won't hurt to take a look at the listings.
Otherwise, definitely avoid not only Cejl, but also its surroundings (streets like Vranovská, Francouzská, etc., that's a pretty bad address), and some parts of Židenice are a bit of a ghetto.
In contrast, the Veveří neighbourhood is very student-oriented, Královo Pole and that direction is nice, apart from that, it's close to most of the faculties of VUT (I don't know which one you're joining).
I have never looked for a rental, but I am a native of Brno, so I can possibly advise you on Brno as such, if you need any more information.
This is, however, an example of "normal" thinking.
What some doctors have decided to do somewhere in Poland is actually fine, that the state does not sufficiently fund some schools.
They can either learn what they want and pay for it themselves, or they can follow the state curriculum and have the state pay for it.
We cannot allow a private actor to take control of a part of the education system just because they add a few coins to the full state contribution and will be able to teach whatever they want in the schools.
Such a statement loses some of its weight when it comes from a person who two days before wrote this about a petition calling for a boycott of a totalitarian state:
So a vote against someone having an abortion is the same to you as a vote against a statue standing in a town square?
I would consult directly with the person who gave you the job.
Otherwise, I have already experienced during the cataloging/digitization that (even long-term professionals) either guess, or write something like xxx *** or ... (according to convention), and in the notes that it is unreadable.
The truth is, in this case, it's pretty readable, so I probably wouldn't recommend it.
Personally, I would deal with it by adding a note, depending on which program you are using.
If you want to be a good and diligent student, you can look up some trademark databases and find the nearest one.
But since it looks like you're drawing from a book, I would guess that the author or the printer simply created their own symbol that matches what's physically on the coin.
PS: It's not a coincidence that it's the Kingdom of Odrys instead of OdryN?
PSS: Someone has already cracked it here.

Politicians don't even know what will be "the theme" of our presidency.
That is a much bigger mess than having interpreters with them.
The idea that they would approve something because nobody understood some text is laughable.
All important approved documents are examined word by word, and basic knowledge of English is not enough for that, that is the job of lawyers.
Hundreds of translators and interpreters work in various EU institutions. English is more suitable for politicians for informal relations and the establishment of non-standard relationships.
Moreover, with the English language, it's quite interesting, after GB's exit from the EU.
I don't understand the hate for Ceylon.
I've been working there for three years now and I'm doing just fine.
I've driven home from work at 10pm and never had any problems.
Only someone who has never been there in their life can say that it is a ghetto.
Yes, most of the Roma population of Brno lives there, but all they do is block the sidewalk and park where they shouldn't :D It's definitely not the case that I would be afraid to go out on the street there in the evening.
So, if you are looking for relatively cheap housing with good access to the city center, I would go for it.
There are now a lot of newly reconstructed or newly built apartments there.
Felix Slováček (78) without Dáda and Gelemová as a stick in the fence!
Who are you spending Christmas with?
On Sunday, most people lit the first candle on the Advent wreath, but Felix Slováček didn't.
I don't have an Advent wreath, so there was nothing to light.
I saw Dády's wreath and I'm sure Lucie has one too, said the Blesk saxophonist, confirming Patrasová's words that she often visits her.
He visits, but does not live in their house in Vinohrady, where Dáda was left alone after his departure.
Slováček still doesn't know where he will be on Christmas Eve.
We recently met up with Anička, Felix and their two grandchildren.
VIDEO: Felix Slováček and Lucie Gelemová: TOGETHER AGAIN!
Felix Slováček and Lucie Gelemová: TOGETHER AGAIN!
But we kept talking, so Christmas didn't happen.
I really don't know where I'll be.
I buy presents all the time and I will definitely buy something for Dad and Lucia, probably some perfume.
I'm a gentleman, added Felix, who came to the launch of the music video alone to the Richman club.
I'm here alone, but I don't feel alone.
I always find someone to have a good time with, says Slováček, who was pleased to meet Luďka Sobota's wife, Adriana, or singer Kamila Nývltová.
And he made it very clear.
And we are Iceland so that we can afford not to have soldiers or weapons?
I doubt that someone will defend us and our location is so strategic that an aggressor would have to be a complete idiot not to occupy this area.
And I don't understand why it should be a bad argument, can you explain it to me?
I don't know of any other department that could be deployed in hospitals in a crisis.
There are not enough police officers, and they cannot afford it. The same is true for firefighters, and nowhere else is there such a high percentage of health-trained people at such a level.
And the fact that our army is able to defend just Ostrava goes against previous governments, not the army, which has been asking for new toys for quite some time.
Record drought in the Czech Republic.
Agricultural subsidies need to be changed, the countryside is not just a food factory, says the journalist.
The Czech Republic is experiencing the worst drought in decades.
According to the scientists, there is less water in mountainous and sub-mountainous areas, and even places where there has been no shortage of moisture are recording lower rainfall totals.
The cause of the drought, which is affecting large parts of Central Europe, is climate change.
However, the impacts are also exacerbated by the way in which we manage the soil.
What should you prepare for in relation to the drought?
And how can we help nature in difficult times?
Well, I can barely stay on my skates on the ice, I know what it is to play hockey and the tactics (which I tried in Franchise Hockey Manager) are also total nonsense.
And whether you're a "Russian bear" hockey team or a "Chinese lama" team, losing by two goals when you don't have to win the game at all costs is different than when it's level.
But as it is, what I listen to the Czech commentators, who point out what the referees pay attention to and what they don't, whether it's men's or women's hockey, it's all weird, but that's how it is with all sports, UEFA and "Italian actors" or motorsport F1, WRC, etc.
Controversy is everywhere.
And, in my opinion, if it were the other way around, it would be as usual, and since the Czech Republic has lost to Russia more often than it has won, it would be the classic "they lost" versus "WE won".
Coronavirus: Russia passes 10 million cases
On Saturday 11 December, the Czech Republic recorded 9080 daily infections.
5766 people are hospitalised.
In total, 34,451 people died in the Czech Republic, another 74.
In the Czech Republic, there are 1967 confirmed cases per 100,000 in the last 14 days, and 871 per 100,000 in the last week.
The number of cases in Russia exceeded 10 million on Sunday.
In the past 24 hours, 29,929 new infections have been registered.
It's the fewest daily cases since Oct. 13.
The total number of registered infections in Russia is 10,016,896.
The daily death toll is 1,132, the lowest daily death toll since the end of October.
Britain is facing an "inevitable" large wave of Omicron infections, Dr Susan Hopkins, the chief medical adviser to the UK Health Security Agency, told television on Sunday.
New quarantine measures will be required.
People infected with Omicron are already in hospital in the UK and Hopkins expects that number to rise.
So far, no one has died from Omicron, but hospitalizations occur about 14 days after infection and deaths about three weeks after infection.
British Labour Party leader Keir Starmer said on Sunday Boris Johnson appeared to have broken the law by holding a Christmas quiz at Downing Street in December last year, when a lockdown was in place and Christmas parties were banned.
One minister in Johnson's government defended that the quiz took place "virtually" via a computer.
However, it was attended by groups of staff gathered around computers in Downing Street.
There is growing pressure in Britain for Johnson to step down as prime minister.
During last December, when a strict lockdown was introduced in London and Christmas parties were banned, Johnson's ministers held numerous parties in defiance of the lockdown.
The British public and media are furious that Johnson and his government are making a mockery of them:
Paul Brand, ITV commercial editor for the UK: Two years ago today Boris Johnson won a landslide victory in the general election.
The Conservative Party is talking this morning about the need to remove him from the position of prime minister.
Remarkable how quickly events have developed.
Do you want to turn it around and save your skin?
Hungary is due to hold elections in the spring that could end Viktor Orban's 12-year rule.
They will be European-wide elections.
How fair can we expect them to be?
They will not be fair.
They will probably not be free either, as the last two elections under Orbán were not.
His Fidesz party controls the media, changes election district boundaries to its advantage, and does other minor or major tricks.
The last one sounds like everyone can choose where they want to vote in practice.
This will allow Fidesz to transfer voters from decided districts to those where the outcome is uncertain and the opposition could win.
So I'll just repeat that they won't be fair at all.
Do you think it will be just as unfair as in 2014 and 2018?
After all, the situation is significantly different.
Before, it was not a question of whether Fidesz would win, but how much and whether it would have a constitutional majority.
There is now a real chance that the united opposition will win more votes and seats.
This is an unusual situation for Viktor Orbán and his party.
Will they play even harder in an effort to retain power?
Yes, we have some indications that they are prepared to go beyond what they have done so far.
Recently, a recording of the Speaker of Parliament and one of the leaders of Fidesz, László Kövér, was leaked to the independent media. In the recording, he explains to the heads of the secret services that the opposition is a threat to national security.
Those are the hints of a new approach you're talking about?
Yes, that's one of the new features.
Everything starts with the tongue.
I was beaten quite often, the last time when I was 14, my mother doesn't have much patience, neither do I, my father has a lot of patience, but then he gets extremely angry (only in relation to me).
I'm also very choleric and I used to get so angry when I was little that I would lie on the floor in convulsions and turn blue. They had to take me under the shower twice to calm me down.
They would sometimes reprimand me, and sometimes it was more like they didn't know what else to do.
I definitely have a tendency to solve things with violence now too. When I was little, I fought a lot. Now, I just punch something to let off steam. When I was younger, I might have slapped my parents on the hand, for example (so that I wouldn't get spanked too hard), so I've never done anything extreme, but I always have that urge.
I can't tell to what extent it's my temper, but upbringing certainly has its part to play in it.
I'm afraid that I'm going to lose my patience with my own kids and deal with it the same way.
I think hitting children is just wrong and my parents shouldn't have done it, especially not at that moment, when it was no longer "educational," but out of frustration. On the other hand, I think that every parent messes up something, it's probably impossible to not spoil your children at least a little bit, so I don't blame them for it.
I'm not offended, I don't understand why the OP should be ashamed of anything.
Laws should be clear and unambiguous.
I would call Kundas those who create laws of such quality.
Otherwise, I would be interested to know if you are afraid of losing your income?
Can you really count on people wanting and buying the product and will you have enough to pay the mortgage?
Kočner's monstrous world.
Where will Slovakia take the trial of the killers of journalist Kuciak?
In Slovakia, the main trial begins for the four accused of the murder of Ján Kuciak and Martina Kušnírová.
The death of the investigative reporter and his partner has changed Slovakia.
It has mobilised civil society, but it has also revealed the practices of the accused businessman Marian Kočner and his links to the top of Slovak politics and justice.
What will the process mean for Slovakia?
For this, journalists are hugely to blame.
How is it possible that this petition has had orders of magnitude more media attention than the counter-petition of the deans of all the medical faculties, which came out a day or two later?
No, they were taken by surprise and the company jumped ship.
In Czech television, people were dying from COVID even half a year ago.
Another government ends and the law on the involvement of municipalities in the selection of a storage site is nowhere to be found
Minister Karel Havlíček’s proposal needs a major overhaul
The government of Prime Minister Andrej Babiš is coming to an end, and the law that was supposed to guarantee the respect of the interests of municipalities and their citizens in the selection and authorisation of a deep geological repository for high-level radioactive waste still does not exist.
The Government Legislative Council interrupted the discussion of the proposal, which the Ministry of Industry and Trade submitted to the government after years of delays.
Its content, however, is in serious conflict not only with the affected municipalities, which are members of the Platform against the Deep Repository, but also with the Association of Towns and Municipalities of the Czech Republic.
Self-governing bodies are expecting a significant strengthening of their decision-making powers in relation to a storage facility, which has been promised to mayors since 2011, when the first work on this legislation began, and which is required by the Czech Atomic Act and the European directive.
We expect that the new government will, in accordance with its coalition agreement, revise the proposal in cooperation with the municipalities.
The draft law from Minister Karel Havlíček, which Platforma has access to, is criticized by municipalities mainly for: The proposed level of involvement of municipalities and the public in the decision-making process on the selection of the site for the storage facility is inadequate and cannot ensure respect for the interests of municipalities and their citizens.
It can only be truly effective if communities or the public can influence whether the process will continue in a given location.
This can be achieved by requiring the Storage Administration to request permission from the affected municipalities before initiating a specific procedure.
The proposed draft of the land-use plan almost completely ignores the involvement of the public and turns the citizens of municipalities into mere statistics in the approval process.
The proposal lacks a system of compensation for municipalities for the entire process of finding and selecting the site for the storage facility, its approval, and operation.
According to today's legal norms, representatives of municipalities do not have many options to defend the interests of their citizens when they are looking for a place for a storage facility.
Only in some permitting procedures can they submit their comments or appeal, but it is the authority or minister who has an interest in issuing the permit that makes the decision.
The potential lawsuit does not have a suspensive effect on the carrying out of survey or construction work.
The co-determination of local authorities, which the Platform is requesting, is a principle that is commonly used in many democratically developed countries and certainly in those that have already advanced in allowing storage facilities, such as Sweden or Finland.
The preparation of the law is yet another failure of the state administration, which hires external law firms to prepare legislation.
In this case, it concerns a contract with the law firm HAVEL & PARTNERS s.r.o., which was entered into by SÚRAO and which follows on from contracts with the lawyer Jan Zemánek.
According to the register of contracts, the total sum for this work is almost 4 million Czech crowns.
Antonín Seknička, deputy mayor of the village of Cejle from the Hrádek area and spokesperson for the Platform Against Deep Storage, said: After the industry ministers, who only pushed the alignment of the position of self-governing bodies with state authorities in the search for a deep storage of highly radioactive waste to their successors, we expect a more significant turnaround from the new government.
We are also offering a helping hand.
We would also like to thank the Association of Municipalities and Towns, which, like the directly affected municipalities in selected locations, views the issue of insufficient rights of municipalities in relation to such a fundamental construction in the same way.
The platform against deep storage brings together 51 members (35 municipalities and towns and 16 associations) in order to promote a change in the state's approach to dealing with spent nuclear fuel and other radioactive waste, which will not be limited to deep storage.
The platform further proposes that the decision on the selection of the location for any storage should be subject to the prior approval of the affected municipalities.
John Goodman's (69) fear forced him to lose weight: He lost 90 kg.
Although he didn't need to change his lifestyle for a long time, he was eventually scared by doctors.
He was told that if he didn't lose the weight, he would die.
And it took up a lot of time.
Goodman lost 90 kg, which is half of his original weight of 180 kg, says The Sun.
He showed off his new look in Los Angeles at the premiere of the animated series The Freak Brothers.
He's a completely different person from the fat guy in the Roseanne sitcom!
John liked to joke that friends and family asked him to lose weight because his large body caused furniture to break.
"I put everything in my mouth," the actor said in a 2018 interview with AARP.
This time, I wanted to do it slowly.
Move, exercise.
I'm getting to an age now where I can't afford to sit on the sidelines, said Goodman, whose transformation is remarkable.
It also depends on what kind of boss and in what context you want to use the word "boss".
If it's some kind of text on a platform that expects readers from the gaming environment, I wouldn't translate it at all.
If it were a formal text, perhaps a university text, I would probably look for ways to describe or explain the boss.
To make matters worse, there are different types of bosses.
For example, in a game like Dark Souls, there are multiple bosses, right? And so a "boss" is something like a lord/ruler of a given level, and then there's the final boss...
In many games, there are hidden bosses (super boss, hidden boss), which are not necessary to defeat in order to complete the game or level, but are often more powerful than the standard boss.
Then there are games like Half-Life, where there are bosses, but the player doesn't fight them directly (Tentacle, Gargantua), and can they be called bosses at all?
And then there are the mini-bosses.
It's not possible to translate the word "boss" into a single word in general. Czech and other languages don't have a solution for this (Catalan is an interesting exception, as it translates the word "boss" as "final opponent").
It is simply a computer-controlled opponent that is more powerful than all previous ones and guards the completion of some level or task for the story or the game in general.
The whole world is looking for Peter from London.
The Czech police have also become involved.
The British police has been looking for the missing Petra Srncová since 3 December.
The Czech police were also involved in the search.
They have been looking for the 32-year-old woman from Uherské Hradiště since 7 December.
At the same time, Interpol is helping the British police.
Her colleagues last saw the Czech woman, Petra Srncová, on November 28th.
British police have been looking for her since December 3.
Interpol issued a so-called "yellow notice" for her.
So the whole world is looking for Peter.
"The Czech police is working closely with the British police," confirmed police spokesperson Kateřina Rendlová.
"We are sharing information on the case," she added.
The announced search for Petra has already appeared on the police website.
She is said to be 168 centimetres tall, thin, with brown eyes and long straight hair of the same colour.
It should come from Uherskohradišťsko.
Petra worked as a nurse in one of London's hospitals.
Her friends and colleagues are worried about her as this kind of disappearance is very unusual for her
The local MP, Harriet Harman, also joined the search for Peter.
She got involved with putting up flyers with Petra's face on them.
"We're extremely concerned about her," she said at a press conference on Saturday.
In connection with the disappearance, British police have already arrested one suspect.
However, it is not clear who it is and what he had in common with Petra.
Agent Tesla is terrorising pre-Christmas Czechia.
While data in October showed a slight decline in attack campaigns, last month with the end of the year approaching, attacks ramped up significantly.
We recorded a major campaign related to Agent Tesla on November 18.
The attacks are specifically aimed at the Czech Republic.
The attackers' strategy remains the same for now.
An infected attachment in an email is designed to grab the user's attention with a name that references payments and financial transactions.
While last month the dangerous attachment had the word invoice in its name, this time it was marked as Copy of Receipt 11.2021...exe," said Martin Jirkal from Eset.
The spyware scans internet browsers and other programs such as Microsoft Outlook, Mozilla Thunderbird, and Yandex e-mail clients.
The malicious code actively searches for saved logins, which it then sends to the attackers.
The last major campaign in the Czech Republic took place at the end of August and beginning of September, and with the approaching holidays and the end of the year the activity of the attackers is once again on the rise.
In November, the Formbook spyware remained active.
In contrast to Agent Tesla, the attackers in this case do not specifically target the Czech Republic, and security experts detected global campaigns in November.
In comparison to October's Formbook data, Formbook weakened slightly in November, but still accounts for nearly one fifth of all detections.
The attacks continued throughout the month, with increased activity on the 3rd, 10th, and 15th of November.
The formbook usually contained an attachment with the .exe extension named REQUEST FOR SPECIFICATION.
However, the term "receipt" continues to be used.
A Czech-language attachment could then be far more dangerous for a Czech user.
A significant decrease and dampening of activity is noted by security analysts in the Fareit program, which was responsible for 1.6% of attacks and had no major offensive campaigns in the Czech Republic in recent months.
Today's demo of smart people who don't need oxygen because oxygen is for vaccinated idiots.
The march through Prague was larger than the media reported.
Judging by the footage of the march along the embankment and according to my experience as a demonstrator, I would estimate the number of people at around 10,000.
People in the procession filled the embankment and the bridge and the opposite embankment road.
This means that there are really a lot of people.
An unprecedented number of passers-by spontaneously join the march of about four thousand demonstrators.
I claim that something new is being born here, writes Radek Mokrý.
That persistent dissatisfaction of several large groups or layers of the population has led them to find a common language.
The anti-vaxxers, anti-maskers and the like would not be able to fill or pay for such a large procession.
The activities of the Chcípl pes society are on the rise in popularity, it reminds me of the Million Moments for Democracy.
Sometimes I get the feeling that they even rent the same stage and equipment.
It is hard to say what kind of movement could be created from this discontent; it depends not only on the influx of money, but also on whether the three-dose vaccine from Pfizer will not become four or more doses.
It will definitely not be a left-wing or centrist movement, you can bet on that.
A three-dose vaccine is almost certainly going to become a multi-dose vaccine, as it is clear that we are going to have to be re-vaccinated every six months.
I'm very glad that the vaccines saved us.
It is a brilliant action of the scientists, which humanity has the right to be proud of.
The end of the heel, Bulgaria has a new prime minister announcing change
Bulgarian President Rumen Radev has tasked Kiril Petkov from the anti-corruption movement We Continue the Change, which won the November elections, to form a new government.
Tom has already managed to form a broad coalition government, which is expected to take office in a few days.
The political crisis in the country has been ongoing since April, when the former government lost the elections under the pressure of anti-corruption protests.
The winning parties, which had pledged to fight corruption and abuse of power, were unable to reach an agreement, so there were two more early elections.
What do cats do when no one is watching?
The "secretly" shot footage has become a global hit.
In the UK, concerns were growing over the weekend about the fate of a 32-year-old Czech woman who has been missing for several days and is being sought by London police.
Ms Srncova was last seen two weeks ago when she was driving home from work to the south of the British capital.
In addition to the police, her former employer and the MP representing the part of London where she lived are also calling for information about the children's hospital worker.
"Petra's disappearance is completely out of character and we are becoming increasingly concerned for her welfare," said Lucy O'Connor of the Lambeth police station, where Ms. Srncova worked, in a Saturday video.
"Her family in the Czech Republic are also very concerned and just want to know where she is," she continued.
According to her, the missing Czech woman left work around 19:45 on Sunday 28 November and headed home to the Camberwell area.
She was last seen on a bus about 30 minutes later.
Her disappearance was reported on 3 December by one of her colleagues.
According to British media, Srncová worked as a "nurse's assistant" at the Evelina London Children's Hospital, which is part of the Guy's and St Thomas' hospital group.
"We have grave concerns for our dear colleague Petra who is missing," the group of medical facilities said in a Twitter post.
"We are appealing for anyone who may have any information which could assist in finding her to contact police," the statement continued.
Zdeňka Dvořáková Kocourková, an amateur children's room painter from Šumperk (and also a regional Pirate Party councillor) was reported by an anonymous person for violating copyrights with her paintings.
The court, however, found that Krtek's paintings in the Šumperk rooms do not violate the law.
In Ústí nad Labem, there was a month-long hole in the road in the form of an uncovered canal.
It was a matter of life and death.
The municipality referred the complaints to the Road and Motorway Directorate, which owns the road, and because it supposedly did not respond, the hole continued to grow.
Eventually, the authorities clarified the responsibilities and ownership and after a month, ŘSD began to "intensively deal with the situation".
