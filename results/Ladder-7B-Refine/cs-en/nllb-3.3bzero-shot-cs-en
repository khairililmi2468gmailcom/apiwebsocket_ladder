The big comeback of the Czech loser is approaching.
Pavel Francouz called up to the NHL
Czech ice hockey goaltender Pavel Francouz, who has been going through a difficult period in his career in recent months, is returning to the NHL.
The 31-year-old Pilsen native will be on the bench and could soon find his way into the goal.
The former goalkeeper of Litvínov, Plzeň or Russian Chelyabinsk was injured in preparation for the NHL in October this year.
He was swapped out exactly in the middle of the game with Vegas and has not appeared on an NHL ice rink since.
The incident occurred as the experienced goalkeeper moved from one post to another.
"Pavel Francouz will be out approximately three to four weeks with a lower-body injury," the team announced in early October.
His return to the NHL net eventually stretched to more than two months.
He was called up from the farm on Sunday morning U.S. time, where he had caught four games and showed his old form.
In the AHL, he recorded 94.5% of the saves.
The Plzeň-born hockey player wants to finally make it and prove that he belongs in the best league in the world.
He had hip problems in his senior year and didn't play a single game in the shortened pandemic season.
In the NHL, "Francík" played 36 games, his save percentage is 92.3%.
Charles' Christmas card features Camille's mask, William and Kate pose in Jordan
British Prince William and his wife Kate have chosen a family photo taken during a trip to Jordan as their Christmas card this year.
Prince Charles also published his wishes, using a photo of his wife Camilla helping him put on a mask at the races.
The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) reported this on its website.
They are sending wishes to friends, colleagues and foundations they work with.
The photograph was taken somewhere in a desert landscape.
The Duchess of Cambridge is dressed in a long khaki summer dress, and Princess Charlotte is wearing a dress too.
Prince William, the Duke of Cambridge, is wearing shorts and a collared shirt, just like Princes George and Louis.
It is not clear who took the photograph or when it was taken.
Last year the royal family posed for their Christmas card photograph on a stack of straw in front of a pile of logs at their country home in Norfolk.
The heir to the throne, Prince Charles, and his wife Camilla also released a picture to serve as a Christmas greeting.
The photographer Sam Hussein captured him in June at the Ascot races.
Charles, who is wearing a cap and a mask on his face, helps Camille put on her mask, which matches her light-coloured dress.
According to efotbal.cz, Slavia promised Berbr a million for the title, Tvrdík denied it.
Prague - Criminal investigators in the current corruption case are allegedly working with the fact that the accused former vice-president of the Czech Football Association, Roman Berbr, was promised a million crowns by Prague Slavia for the league title in the 2018/19 season.
The website efotbal.cz reported this, stating that it had access to part of the police files.
The chairman of the Vršovice club, Jaroslav Tvrdík, said that the red and whites did not engage in any corruption.
The server published transcripts of police wiretaps, in which the former sports director of Slavia, Jan Nezmar, who left the championship club last summer, is mainly mentioned.
The former influential official of the red-and-whites was, according to the file, in frequent contact with both Berber and the former sports director of the then second-league Vyšehrad, Roman Rogoz, who is also among the accused in the case.
The police are said to have worked with information that Slavia had promised Berbatov a financial reward for winning the title.
In 2019, the SK Slavia Prague team won the first league title.
The police authority had knowledge that Roman (Berbr) was promised a million-dollar bribe by the officials of SK Slavia Prague for winning the league, the server quoted from the file.
The day after, according to the police, Berbr met not only with Nezmar, but also with the chairman of the board of Slavia, Tvrdík.
According to the server, it is not clear from the file whether the police are still dealing with this information.
Tvrdík denied any corrupt conduct.
Between 2015 and 2017, we actively tried to change the situation in Czech football and offered an alternative to its development.
We have never committed any illegal acts, we have not tried to influence the referees in violation of the fair play rules and we have not provided anyone with any financial benefits in this regard," Tvrdík told Seznam Zprávy.
In the wiretaps, Nezmar, among other things, indiscriminately insults some of the former dark-skinned players of Slavia and also slanders his former boss Tvrdík.
The case of alleged match-fixing through referees was triggered by a police raid in mid-October last year at several locations including the FAČR headquarters in Prague.
The highest-ranking official in the affair is Berbr, who is no longer involved in any of the football functions.
In mid-January, he was released from custody, just like the former sports director of Vyšehrad, Rogoz.
Helicopters, tanks and BVPs are the Cold War LARP.
The new tanks will be of a worse type (artillerymen will have to leave the armoured cabin and carry the shells by hand without cover).
The cars - Toyota Hi-luxes - are new and good
Trucks and various armoured vehicles - at a decent level, moreover, it has already managed to get rid of the Prague V3S even in specialist units.
Aircraft: combat - decent, but at the end of the lease, passenger - too small with a short range, but modern.
Drones - few and small types with no combat potential
We don't have any rockets (but we make them and export them abroad)
PVO: medium - Cold War, obsolete; short-range - good, modern, relatively good number.
I have a story.
I have a hunting lodge right next to the city.
The nutria were coming out of the river and causing damage to the crops, so I sat there.
When I arrived, I saw that there was a fisherman on the other side of the river.
I didn't want to make a scene, so I sat down quietly and the guy probably didn't notice me.
I hoped that he would leave before something came out, but of course, the fox went out after a while.
I let her come to 40 yards before I decided to shoot.
The poor fisherman almost soiled himself, he was waving his cap in all directions, so I called out to him that it was a fox.
Before I got off the bench, I was livid.
In other words, even a meadow can be a pruser.
On the other hand, it's not a war, it would take a lot of coincidences for something to happen, you would probably be seen on a thermal camera, which almost everyone has these days.
So, put your valuables in a visible place, put them in your sleeping bag, and you should be fine.
Vojtěch versus Hamáček.
The Ministry of the Interior obtained respirators much more cheaply than the Ministry of Health
The state, responsible for the purchase and distribution of face masks, masks and respirators for the professions closest to the coronavirus, has spent billions of crowns on their acquisition in recent weeks.
The iRozhlas server compared the purchases of individual ministries and found that during a single day, the amounts for respirators varied by hundreds of crowns.
Why did prices fluctuate so dramatically?
Which authorities have been frugal?
And why did others buy more expensive ones?
Lenka Kabrhelová speaks with iRozhlas editor Dominika Kubištová.
I respect the soldiers and the army (I am probably not affected by the memories of the ČSLA that the older generations have gone through), but the Czech Republic cannot benefit from compulsory military service.
We don't even have large stocks of equipment that could be used by trained people, we don't even have modern equipment for the current professionals, and on top of that, modern equipment is getting more and more complex, so the skills of the substitutes will be rapidly lost over time.
On top of that, modern conventional conflicts, where anyone can deploy them, will happen very quickly, and there won't be time to retrain anyone.
And finally, the reserves/territorial defence are of great importance for countries like Ukraine, where it is necessary to conduct mass guerrilla warfare and to deter the enemy.
In the Czech Republic, we will only be able to fight in a conflict of such a scale and intensity that guerrilla warfare will be irrelevant, and we do not have the right geography for that.
Mainly, we don't have individual skills.
It's not even the worst part.
The worst part is that half of them play like they have it.
Then you find yourself in a situation where you're watching a guy who two minutes ago missed an empty net, drives into the attack alone between 2 or even 3 Swiss and you ask yourself "what the hell does he think is going to happen now?"
Of course, they will take him as an average taxpayer.
The situation with this skill "to outwit the defender" is so terrible that I find myself genuinely surprised when I see that our attacker managed to outplay one of the opponent's players.
The first signs
The Covid-19 pandemic is slowing down, but experts do not expect any major change in the coming weeks.
The pressure on hospitals will continue for some time according to statistical models, and a new unknown has been added to the pandemic equation: the Omicron variant, which is very likely to spread faster than the currently dominant Delta.
At the same time, it is not yet possible to say with absolute certainty whether it can cause a more severe course, how much vaccination or post-infection immunity acquired from a previous infection helps against it.
This week, however, an unexpected phenomenon on the plus side entered the Covid equation: the possibility of treatment.
A new drug, the antiviral molnupiravir, has arrived in the Czech Republic. It reduces the risk of severe illness and hospitalisation by a third and can be taken at home.
Soon, it should be joined by the Pfizer drug paxlovid, which, according to the current results, reports a success rate of even 85 percent.
The first deliveries of molnupiravir to the Czech Republic, in addition to the hope of expanding the portfolio of tools useful in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic, have also highlighted the question of how prepared the Czech administration is for the arrival of new drugs.
As mentioned, the first to reach domestic patients will be Merck's molnupiravir.
The company ended up on the tape first because the drug had been in development for a long time before the current pandemic broke out, with the aim of finding a suitable treatment for a viral disease of horses on the South American continent.
What is often overlooked in this research is that people in the West (Germany, Sweden, etc.)
are generally less open and do not share their opinions openly.
On the other hand, Eastern Europeans, and especially us Czechs, are used to saying "as if a beak had grown on our nose".
See, you do research where you ask people if they like Muslims.
In the Czech Republic, most people will tell you straight out that they don't.
In the West, they will tell you how much they love migration, how everyone should help them, and how we Czechs are racist scum.
And then they go and vote for parties like the AfD.
They are afraid of cancel culture, saying this in public means losing your job and media lynching.
Then it looks nice in the polls, west good, east bad.
But they will find out what people really think.
In France, Le Pen and Zemmour both have more than 20%, according to the poll.
We even know that the objects are three and completely identical.
Identical for the sake of unit rotation, so that soldiers don't have to relearn where things are, all the buildings are essentially the same.
One of them is the Atom Museum of the Brdy, and the other two are abandoned.
It is funny that the USSR did not want to have nuclear warheads on its own territory, either for security reasons or for the speed of deployment of the warheads due to its more western location.
Only the warheads were stored in the underground bunkers (there are two in each maple tree), not the whole missiles as they say.
If it was necessary to use this weapon, a special unit would come and pick up the head and mount it on some kind of carrier.
In addition to the museum maple, the rest are in a dilapidated state.
In the second grade of elementary school, we had a Gypsy classmate, and we were together for four years.
He was pretty good, he made good jokes, he was often too talkative, but he was like our mascot.
Everyone played with him, he often came and wanted to explain something, he was almost always there, he played sports with us, he didn't steal snacks or phones, he was dressed properly.
He went to outdoor schools, did various monkey business, but he was fine, he was never in any trouble.
In the eighth or ninth grade, siblings, gypsies, entered the same grade, different classes.
Shortly afterwards, they beat up the teacher, the police were often there, they threatened and endangered other students...
I personally sell things on the classifieds (old things, things I don't need, etc.) and I've sold to Gypsies many times, they always had money, they didn't try to get me to raise the price, the communication was calm.
I even sold a car this way, a guy called a month later to say that he had already transferred it to his name...
I say myself that I am not a racist, I don't care if someone is white, black, yellow, blue or any other, as long as they behave as they should in a decent society (work, function, don't beat women, just normal behaviour).
But when someone comes, stretches out his hand, empties apartments and houses, has only a mess around him, makes trouble... it doesn't matter what colour he is, but it will bother me.
I have no problem with African migrants, as long as they get involved here, start businesses, work, learn the language (not necessarily, at least English), and respect our culture.
I don't care if they believe in Allah, as long as they respect my traditions and culture, I will respect theirs.
A young woman died in a car accident in Prachatice
"The young woman suffered serious multiple injuries and despite resuscitation efforts, unfortunately, she succumbed to her injuries on the spot," said Zuzana Fajtlová, the spokesperson for the South Bohemian emergency medical services, to Právo.
The accident was probably caused by the driver who was taking the girl.
The 18-year-old driver of the Peugeot was probably driving from the village of Žíchovec to the village of Bavorov and for unknown reasons drove into the oncoming traffic in a bend.
After the collision with the Skoda Octavia, the Peugeot ended up on its roof off the road, described the accident the spokesperson for the South Bohemian police, Štěpánka Schwarzová.
The young Peugeot driver suffered very serious injuries in the accident.
He had multiple injuries and was trapped in the car.
After being rescued, he had to be given emergency pre-hospital care and was airlifted to the České Budějovice hospital in a stable condition, stated rescue worker Fajtlová.
She added that the man in the other car suffered minor chest injuries and was taken to hospital.
New rules apply to parcels from non-EU countries, customers often do not provide information about them
Lukáš Neuheisl orders from abroad several times a month.
He mainly collects collector's cards.
"It's usually tens of dollars, say from ten dollars upwards, where it's still worth importing, especially from Japan, where the post is often free," says the collector.
Since October, ordering small parcels has become slightly more expensive for him, he now has to add VAT and hand over data to the post office for customs clearance.
He will receive an e-mail informing him that customs is awaiting the arrival of the package.
Then it is enough to fill in the details of the shipment, and if the seller did not include VAT at the time of the sale, the customs office will assess it from the total amount for the shipment and transport.
If the recipient does not take care of the customs procedures himself, the carrier's fee must also be added to the total amount.
According to Lukáš Neuheisel, however, the whole process is not complicated.
I click one or two check boxes, insert two attachments and I'm done.
For me, it's usually a matter of five minutes, says Neuheisl.
Not all deliveries go smoothly, however.
Due to new customs regulations, the daily number of parcels received from abroad at the international post office in Prague has fallen from 60,000 to 15,000.
According to the Czech Post, the problem is also that people do not respond to requests for information needed to complete the customs procedure.
Currently, there are 30,000 parcels on international mail that we have to process.
If people filled in all the information that is required and filled it in on time, we would be about halfway there, says Czech Post spokesman Matyáš Vitík.
Inflation solutions
See the title, how would you propose to solve the current inflation?
Currently, we are at 9.9% inflation and it is expected to rise further.
What do you think should be done to slow or compensate for this growth?
We see, for example, in Poland the reduction of VAT on food and PHM, is this the way for you?
What do you think is going to happen that's inevitable with where it's going?
Prices are rising faster than wages, and it is inevitable that people will not be able to afford ordinary things, especially energy.
How much did you get added (if you are an employee)?
I've had 2% added to my gross this year, which is a joke, but luckily I have a similar income from a business I run alongside my job.
Would someone be able to explain to me why convicted violent offenders are sent to prison for only 6 months?
I just can't get my head around how a court can send such a beast to prison for just six months only for him to do it again as soon as he gets out.
6 months is nothing compared to the fact that his/her victim will have trauma for years, negatively affecting their sexual relationships and relationships in general.
Not to mention the fact that a rape victim may never recover from it.
Will this not also discourage potential future rape victims from reporting?
The man from Hrob "shot" his girlfriend from Kostomlat
The man from the Grave inadvertently helped the officers to secure his nationally wanted girlfriend from Kostomlat, who had a warrant out for her arrest.
He himself called her to it.
He went about it in a roundabout way, though.
First, he approached a passerby and made up a story that he had been robbed.
Officers responded to the 911 call and were surprised when the alleged "victim" told them he made the whole thing up to get the officers to come to the scene.
In fact, he just wanted to ask the police officers how to file a report with the Czech Police.
While checking the identity of the man and his girlfriend, the officers discovered that the woman was on the list of wanted persons, in a nationwide manhunt, and a warrant for her arrest had been issued.
The case is therefore being dealt with by the Czech police.
A sincere question for people here: do you consider our country to be Slavic?
I personally believe that we Slavs are no longer ethnically or culturally, but I would like to hear your opinion.
Otherwise, I agree with the meme, it's a pity that Churchill didn't manage to ensure the liberation of Prague by the USA :')
Of course, I do not deny that we have a Slavic language.
I don't know, it's quite a question whether a rational person can really believe something without evidence just because it might be beneficial.
I personally would not consider such a case to be true faith.
I cannot agree with Pascal here; there are, if I am not mistaken, an estimated 10,000 different religions in the world.
Which god or gods should one choose?
I would say it's pretty likely that in one of those thousands of religions, there is at least one god who will punish you unpleasantly if you believe in another god.
However, even in the Decalogue, it is stated that there is no other god but Yahweh.
In such a case, wouldn't it be more rational to refrain from believing in any god than to risk choosing the wrong one from the thousands of gods and the one true god that I didn't happen to choose sending me to hell or some similar place?
Other: Voluntary training with subsequent inclusion in the reserves.
The Swiss model is apparently similar.
X months of training (in different specializations, X months in one) and under the supervision of professionals with practical experience.
If you do well, you can get a pro offer.
Something like this would be useful for all components of the Czech Armed Forces.
It could be done in cooperation with the University of Defense.
We can talk about it like this: The collaboration between the education sector and industry is constantly being repeated, companies are hunting in schools, and there is some kind of intermingling, where the workforce migrates from educational institutions to employment.
Not just during adolescence, but this process is happening all the time, each of us is constantly learning something new, moving from one field to another, etc.
A similar overlap should work between the civilian and military sectors.
I see it as a way to build a kind of relationship between the citizen and the army, i.e. an institution that guarantees that Russia, Germany or even a Mongolian invader will never invade here again.
I find it funny how you consider NATO to be something carved in stone, we have allies and they will defend us if something goes wrong.
No, don't please the master.
It only takes one election in the USA to screw up their budget and the whole of NATO goes down the drain.
The British will exchange us for Russian money, the Germans will exchange us for Russian gas, and the Poles have already shown that all they have to do is turn their backs and take what they want.
The only thing that works as a long-term guarantor of independence is an army armed to the teeth and a population that can operate the military technology of its time.
Today, every teenager can pilot a remote-controlled vehicle, so what's the problem.
We don't need border fortifications, they're useless these days, but a teenager with a knob on a remote-controlled device can handle it.
How to avoid drowning in a box tsunami
You unwrap the gifts under the Christmas tree and all of a sudden your home is full of boxes and packing materials?
This "waste" is being reused by online shops that are short of packaging materials.
That's why we've created a map of shops that will take your used boxes.
And not just at Christmas.
All packaging materials are designed to withstand repeated handling.
That's why it's a shame to treat them like disposable waste.
Anyone can bring cardboard boxes, plastic or paper fillers to the participating store (the map of the KAMsNIM.cz project contains almost 150 of them).
This will support small businesses, reduce the amount of waste produced and also avoid overflowing blue bins.
The shops themselves welcome the packaging, which is currently in short supply on the market, and the saved money, as the packaging carton has increased in price by 50% in recent times.
In the eyes of environmentally conscious customers, I am strengthening my brand.
One of these stores is TIERRA VERDE, a manufacturer of eco-cosmetics and eco-cosmetics.
The boxes and packing materials are brought to us in Popůvky near Brno by individuals who have accumulated them at home, but we also hear from companies with whom we have arranged regular collections of discarded cardboard.
We use it all to pack the parcels from our e-shop.
Together, individuals and companies are creating a more caring world.
Our wish is to preserve the resources and beauty of nature for future generations, says Petra Lopušníková from Tierry.
The application www.KAMsNIM.cz, however, shows not only collection points for packaging material.
It serves as a search engine if you need to get rid of anything (where to take sorted household waste, where to hand in expired medicines, tyres, retired electrical equipment, batteries, light sources, bulky waste, etc.).
All the waste can end up in the right place, and the reusable items can find their second home.
The project map already contains more than 100,000 such places.
"Gradually, there are more and more collection yards, re-use centres, textile containers, food banks, charity shops, SWAPs and other places that help to find a use for things that would otherwise become unnecessary waste," adds Miroslav Kubásek, one of the authors of the application from the Ukliďme Česko association.
I think it's worse that today's technology is so simple and idiot-proof that children who use a computer or a phone play games on it, but don't learn basic computer skills in the process.
Recently, there has been a problem (mainly in English articles) that university students do not understand the principle of computer components.
Because things like Google Photos or Apple's Photos app or really mobile phones in general just hide the underlying filesystem with folders and dump everything on one screen in the app.
They can use the technique from childhood, but most importantly, they should learn something.
Let's rewrite history, seriously
Emmanuel Macron unveiled the priorities of the French EU presidency - which starts in January - over the weekend and it was grand.
Macron spoke for over an hour, during which he unveiled the logo of the presidency, called for the protection of Europeans - at work, on the street - and mentioned so many actions that they cannot be completed in six months.
French politicians like it and so do the voters.
Macron's supporters, split between the right and left, agree on little, but they do agree on Europe.
And in France, there will be new elections for the head of state in April.
The election calendar also influenced the priorities.
The French leader, among other things, mentioned that historians should write "one history of Europe" and France is ready to create the conditions for such work by historians.
A number of commentators rushed to criticize Macron for pro-European propaganda and rewriting history.
In fact, it is trying to prevent the rewriting of history.
The far-right candidate for the French presidency, Éric Zemmour, is currently touring France with the argument that the Vichy regime, which collaborated with Hitler during World War II, was not so bad, and he is having some success with the French.
Let's take Macron's idea of one history textbook seriously and not look at what's happening in France.
Would it not be needed?
In European countries, students often learn history as a story of us versus them, and never as a story of the whole.
The Spanish, the French, the Czechs are learning who defeated whom in which battle.
But without an enlightened cantor, they will never know the broader context of the event.
The film of the year is Quo vadis, Aida?
The Czech "Mice" didn't win.
The story, which returns to the Srebrenica massacre of 1995, also won awards for best director and best actress Jasna Duričić.
This year at the Karlovy Vary festival, it was at the top of the audience rankings.
The best actor in Berlin was Anthony Hopkins for the film The Father.
I'm not very young, I'm not very healthy/fit and I'm not vaccinated.
It was kind of like "having the flu/being congested" I had diarrhea for a few days and didn't really want to smoke...
It was worse than the common flu.
I don't have diarrhea with the flu.
(Only my personal experience. I'm not saying that everyone is like that.)

Trains start running on new timetable, some operators change
From Sunday, trains will start running on the railway according to a new timetable.
The biggest change is the replacement of carriers on some routes, for example between Ústí nad Labem and Kolín, where instead of České dráhy, RegioJet will start running.
For most lines, only the departure time will be changed, and in some cases, the route will be slightly changed.
There will also be dozens of new trains on the tracks.
The transport companies started selling tickets already in the autumn.
Czech Railways plans to run an average of 6783 passenger services per day in the new timetable, of which an average of 478 will be long-distance trains.
The trains will travel approximately 118 million kilometres during the new timetable.
In addition to domestic connections, the new timetable will also include routes to Germany, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Austria and Switzerland.
The company will introduce dozens of new trains along with the new timetable.
The main new feature will be the InterJet trains, which will run on the Prague-Cheb line.
The transport company will send other new trains to northern Moravia or western Bohemia.
The transport company will also increase the price of tickets by an average of 3.2 percent from next year.
The railways take inflation into account in their tariffs every year.
The biggest change in the RegioJet timetable is the entry on the R23 line Ústí nad Labem – Mělník – Nymburk – Kolín.
The transport company will replace Czech Railways here after winning the Ministry of Transport's competition.
RegioJet will operate a total of 16 trains on the route every day, eight in each direction.
Other changes concern long-distance services between Prague and Brno, which will also stop at Havlíčkův Brod, Žďár nad Sázavou and Kolín stations from Sunday.
Leo Express has retained its 16 connections, two return connections to Slovakia and also weekend connections to Krakow.
According to spokesman Emil Sedlarik, the transport company also tried to keep the timetables of its long-distance trains as similar as possible despite the planned work stoppages.
The operation of Arriva and other transport companies should continue without major changes.
The transport provider is also exchanged on some regional lines.
Changes are coming for passengers, for example in the Českolipsko region, where instead of Czech Railways, the Trilex trains of the German company Die Länderbahn will run on the line from Mladá Boleslav via Česká Lípa to Rumburk.
Passengers will also be able to use a single ticket on the railways in the second year.
Like the Czech Railways, their price will increase by the inflation rate of 3.2%.
I have to disagree.
Are we not learning to see the other side's point of view?
Everywhere we hear how much they had to fight for their rights, how they were oppressed and had to work hard and die.
In my life, I have never heard a lesson from the perspective of the slave-owning side or from that time, no one is defending this, just condemning it.
No one tells you in school that black people often sold other black people into slavery and that they were often the worst slavers.
No one teaches you in school that the colonisers often bought the land from the Indians, they just tell you everywhere how brutally we, the Europeans, exterminated them, while they were killing each other long ago.
I also spent some time in the USA, directly in schools, both in the north and in the south.
I have not encountered anyone deliberately covering up facts, but I have heard of it happening before and I think it is a problem, which I do not deny (for example, in Japan, WW2 atrocities are quite taboo).
My point was more that history is not black and white and that we tend to look at it from today's perspective without understanding.
History doesn't care about people's feelings, it just is what it is, and I think it's a fatal mistake to judge without looking at things from the time.
On the other hand, we should learn from it and never do it again.
By the way, when we're talking about those southern states, yes, the Confederate flag and the famous slave owners are quite popular there, on the other hand, they also had some of their own good successes, and it seemed absurd to me to reject them.
Moreover, the North was not much better than what many people idealize it to be today.
And a lot of people forget that not everyone in the South was a slave owner and that a lot of things bothered them, too.
I wouldn't compare this to the Russians, they deliberately omit some facts, lie and manipulate, moreover, our point of view doesn't exist there (there was a video on YT from the TV, where they turned off someone who started talking about our legionnaires and 1968).
What I found ridiculous about US schools was the rise of Marxism and the idealization of communism, something their country has never experienced.
Overall, I found that at some universities it was awful, the students were quite radicalised and the schools were often supporting them in this.
And when I think of these people being much older one day, it makes me a little bit sick that this could be the voice of the majority, because it is among the young and it is among the ruling elite.
I feel like feminism has already achieved what it was supposed to achieve and it's not about the same thing anymore, it's been radicalized.
Currently, those who have nothing to do with it and ignore the basic biological fact are referred to as feminists, as well as other groups such as LGBT, and it leads to radicalization on the other side, where it often leads to resistance even to quite reasonable things.
Moreover, the more radical someone is, the more they are heard.
In any case, at the end of the day, I've never met anyone who would condemn me for colonialism or slavery.
I met more bad geography, but that was mutual :D
Not because I don't like it here, but because I think it's completely pointless.
Am I supposed to be proud of something I couldn't do on my own?
Moreover, I consider the concept of nationality as a whole to be superfluous in terms of personal identity.
If there is anything that connects me to people, it is interests, views on the world and shared experiences, not where we were born.
I am not a believer, but from what I know, I can tell you this: We have two Greek Catholic parishes here, one is Ukrainian and the other is Slovak.
That Slovak priest is a really nice guy, his sermons are more about theology than politics, but then he always comes up with some nonsense about the coronavirus, that everyone is ashamed of.
Then there is the Czechoslovak Hussite Church, of course.
Officially they are Protestants, but in fact they were born from Catholic modernity and are in fact Catholics without a pope.
I know a lot of people who are Catholic, but they go to the Hussite services, because it's theologically very similar, but the members are usually more liberal.
They have a beautiful and historically very valuable functionalist church on Botanická street.
Otherwise, the church of St. Michael in the Dominican Square belongs to the Dominicans and they even hold mass there every Sunday at 3:00 p.m. in Latin, as it was done before Vatican II.
The Bethlehem flame is in the Czech Republic, the scouts took it from Austria
Břeclav - The flame lit in Bethlehem, where, according to Christian tradition, Jesus Christ was born, is in the Czech Republic.
The scouts did not go to Vienna this time due to the coronavirus pandemic. They picked him up from their Austrian colleagues at the Reintal - Břeclav border crossing in the morning.
They picked him up at the border last year.
The Bethlehem Light is a beautiful Christmas tradition that we participate in every year with the troop, and I look forward to it very much.
It is an honour for me to have been chosen, said scout Amálie Budíková to the journalists present.
While last year the handover took place at the Mikulov-Drasenhofen border crossing, directly on the border bridge, now at the Reintal - Břeclav border crossing in the car park.
However, the scouts usually travel by train to Vienna.
The distribution of the flame across the Czech Republic remains the same.
The scouts traditionally set off with the Bethlehem light by train first to Brno, where they will hand it over to the diocesan bishop Vojtěch Cikrle.
On Saturday, 18 December, the scouts will take care of the subsequent distribution of the light, travelling by selected express and passenger trains.
The light will be taken over by local scouts or volunteers at the stations, who will then spread the flame across the Czech Republic, even to places where the tracks do not lead.
This year, the scouts must also follow the current measures to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.
It's going the same way as last year.
We recommend that both the delivery teams and the organizers of local events wear masks, of course, try to keep their distance, be as few as possible, not sing to each other, in short, to behave in a way that is as safe as possible, described the spokesperson for the Bethlehem Light event, Zuzana Hrbková.
The tradition of the Bethlehem light travelling through Europe was born in 1986 in Austria.
The aim is to spread the idea of peace, friendship and peace along with the flame.
The Bethlehem light is a symbol of hope for believers, a light that overcomes the darkness.
In the Czech Republic, the scouts and guides have been taking care of its spread for more than 30 years.
The event is run by hundreds of volunteers, and the flame is also a symbol of selflessness and human reciprocity.
All the news, including a list of places where people can come to get the flame, can be found on the website www.betlemskesvetlo.cz.
I don't have an economic education, so I don't know the basics of economics that confirm that subsidies are the cancer of the economy, but I don't think that subsidies as a whole would be a problem.
The development of infrastructure, ecology (e.g. water retention), healthcare and education will make good use of the money, but I don't understand why the money is given to agriculture, industry and companies in general.
As mentioned, it produces unnecessary products and disrupts the free market and the "natural life of the company".
I work in a factory where there are a million signs in the corridors saying "Project X funded/co-funded by Project X" and such a company is just artificially kept alive.
This is not supporting a company that gives jobs to x people, this is holding back development when this company is just holding on and taking orders/employees from companies that could grow and be more productive after its demise
I completely agree, it's awful.
Even a person who was born in the Internet age can fall for a trick or a trap - especially advertising.
I don't think I'm affected by internet advertising, but then I get caught out by it anyway - it's just so sophisticated that you can't avoid it.
For this reason, I support the radical voices in the European Parliament who currently want to ban programmatic (= targeted) advertising altogether...
It's all rubbish, in the words of a classic - I would ban the internet.

2. "I won't believe everything the media says"
3. "I don't trust politicians"
TV has fallen out of love with Christmas films, with 200 premiering this year
Los Angeles - Cinemas, television channels and streaming platforms in the United States and other English-speaking countries have fallen for the trend of Christmas films and are premiering a record-breaking more than two hundred this year.
The operator of the IMDb film database counted them.
The genre of Christmas family and romantic films has scored with the audience in recent years and has significantly increased the number of viewers, so more and more of these films are being made.
This year, four times as many Christmas movies were made as in 2011 and twice as many as five years ago.
The IMDb database only includes those films that have the word Christmas in their title, so there are actually many more Christmas films.
The movies that people traditionally associate with Christmas have always been there.
In the Czech Republic, this period is mainly associated with fairy tales, and worldwide, films such as Home Alone, Love Actually or the classic Christmas story Life is Beautiful from 1946 are popular.
The real boom in Christmas films, however, did not start until 2009, when the American cable television channel Hallmark came up with a special film series, the BBC server recalled.
Her Christmas project called Countdown to Christmas at the time included four films and was very successful.
This year, the station began to tune its viewers in for Christmas on October 22 and will present a total of 42 Christmas films.
Competitor Lifetime has 35 new Christmas-themed movies on its schedule this year, and popular streaming services like Netflix are also contributing to the total.
"In this magical time, the story doesn't matter so much, it's important that there are a lot of Christmas trees in the background and that it's snowing," Brandon Gray, author of a book about Christmas films called I'll Be Home for Christmas Movies, said with a smile.
"For the audience, it's a form of escape and a way to feel a little bit of peace for two hours in the midst of all the holiday madness and the madness of the world we've been living in for the last few years," Gray added.
He says that Hallmark, for example, uses the same recipe for its films, which is uniform but successful.
You have two people who fall in love, but then there is a misunderstanding about half an hour before the end, which is resolved and the two of them kiss.
It's a cycle, and as long as all the films look the same and have the same atmosphere, people will watch them one after the other, adds Gray.

Only nineteen drivers will take part in the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix in Formula 1.
Nikita Mazepin has tested positive for COVID-19 and will not take part in the final race of the season.
The Haas stable will only send one formula to the track.
In the last race of the season, he was aiming for a better finish than the 20th place he qualified for.
However, Russian Nikita Mazepin from the Haas team will not take part in the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.
He had tested positive for COVID-19.
Only nineteen cars will appear on the starting grid, with Mazepin's teammate Mick Schumacher starting from the last place, and Max Verstappen starting from the first place, who will face Lewis Hamilton in a direct battle for the title.
According to Haas, Mazepin is doing well and is not showing any symptoms.
Nikita is physically well because he was asymptomatic.
She is now in isolation and will follow the guidance of the relevant public health authorities, with safety being the ultimate priority for all involved," her representatives told formula1.com.
Haas will not send a reserve rider to the race, and cannot.
A substitute would have to qualify or race in another part of the weekend.
The first racer is not dealing with Covid-19.
At the start of the season, Kimi Räikkönen had COVID-19, and last year Sergio Pérez and Lewis Hamilton tested positive.

Gold, silver and 150 diamonds: The price tag of the most expensive sweater will blow your mind!
It's a bit like a portable jewelry store, and the creator put six months of work and all his savings into it.
"I had a vision of what I wanted to create, but little experience. Sweaters were never worn much at home," admits Liban, who spent 3,000 hours on his work in six months.
The silk was bought in Italy, the 24-carat gold thread in France and the 2000 decorative crystals were provided by the Swarowski company.
The silver stars were then adorned with 150 diamonds.
"The base is wool and cotton, but the silk gives the sweater its softness," the creator praises his work, which he does not recommend washing.
And it has another catch.
"I'm completely broke, I have to sell the sweater as soon as possible," admits Liban.
If successful, it will set a world record.
The most expensive sweater sold five years ago cost "only" 720,000 Czech crowns.

The government has approved the deployment of up to 150 soldiers to help Poland.
The surveyors, scouts and drone pilots could be deployed as early as Christmas, with the mission approved for six months.
They are to help their Polish colleagues in protecting the border with Belarus and in building the planned fence.
Poland has officially asked for help from NATO countries in connection with the months-long actions of the Belarusian regime, which invites citizens of Middle Eastern countries to its territory with a false promise of easy crossing of the EU border.
British and Estonian soldiers are already operating on Polish territory.
Is the Omicron mutation spreading in South Moravia?
Public Health is investigating another case of a child from Adam's.
"We currently have another suspected case of this variant in another child from Adam's class, the reception class.
There is no evidence of direct contact with previous cases from the Adamov elementary school," said Ciupek.
Six cases have been reported in the region this week.
"We are still waiting for official confirmation of the variant in our six cases - it is being carried out by the National Reference Laboratory for Influenza and Non-Influenza Viruses of the State Institute for Health Protection in Prague," said the director.
She added that it was two nurses from one department of the Brno University Hospital and two children of one of them, and two eleven-year-old pupils of the Adamov elementary school.
There is no connection between the cases in Brno and Adamov.
According to the director, three of them have mild symptoms, four of them are asymptomatic.
No one with suspicion of Omicron has traveled abroad
None of them have travelled abroad, nor have any of their families, nor have they come into contact with anyone who has been abroad.
None of the people mentioned have any connection to the water polo championship, said Ciupek.
Chief hygienist Pavla Svrčinová previously stated that an international water polo tournament that was held in Brno a few weeks ago is being investigated.
There were players from South Africa and one Belgian player who got sick after returning.
California will restrict gun sales.
It wants to follow Texas' lead on abortion ban.
California Gov. Gavin Newsom announced Saturday a plan to ban the sale and manufacture of some guns in the nation's most populous state through a legal mechanism used by Texas in its controversial abortion law that bans the procedure once a fetal heartbeat is detected.
People would then be entitled to compensation in a lawsuit against anyone who manufactures or sells assault weapons or homemade guns in California.
Newsom's announcement came in response to a Friday ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court that left in place a Texas ban on abortions, even though it goes against a nearly 50-year-old precedent that established a right to abortion nationwide up to about 24 weeks of pregnancy.
The court did not, however, rule on the constitutionality of the entire law, but on a technical issue that arises from the innovative design of the measure.
In this case, enforcement of the ban was turned over to the public, making it impossible for Texas Republicans to challenge it through the usual legal channels.
"I am outraged by yesterday's (Friday) decision by the U.S. Supreme Court to uphold Texas' ban on most abortions and to largely enable Texas' scheme to protect its law," the California governor said.
"If states can now block federal courts from reviewing their laws, then California will use that authority to save lives," Newsom continued.
He is said to have instructed his subordinates to work with the state parliament and the justice minister on a measure that would allow public representatives to enforce the ban on assault rifles and so-called ghost guns.
These are homemade weapons that don't have serial numbers and can be used to circumvent regulations.
Newsom wants "private citizens" to have the right to seek at least $10,000 (220,000 Kč) in damages and legal fees from anyone who manufactures, distributes or sells assault weapons, "ghost gun" parts or kits to make them in California.
"If the most effective way to keep these deadly weapons off our streets is to create the threat of private lawsuits, then that's exactly what we should do," the California governor said.
The AP notes that California has banned the manufacture and sale of some military-style weapons for decades, but a federal judge blocked the ban as unconstitutional in June.
If the state were to now actually reinstate the ban using the Texas template, it would confirm the words of liberal Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who in a dissenting opinion to Friday's majority verdict warned against expanding the legal mechanism to other U.S. states.
The Supreme Court, however, did not grant Texas' abortion ban complete immunity from judicial review, allowing abortion clinics to continue to sue select officials in the southern U.S. state.
Each emergency vaccination has its own public testing phase, where it is gradually determined what the vaccination scheme will look like and the vaccines themselves are also improved based on the results.
For example, a large-scale study on the effects of 4 doses is already underway in Israel.
And according to these studies, in most patients there is a five-fold increase in antibodies, which already has the long-term effect you mentioned.
Just like any other vaccination, it will have its own vaccination schedule in time, it's just too early for that.
Another fact is that a new vaccine based on an inactivated virus should soon be on the market, which, according to the manufacturer's specifications, promises up to 10 times greater effectiveness.

Poland threatens to block EU budget payments
According to Ziobro, the European Commission would be acting in breach of the law if it used its new powers and stopped the payment of funds to Poland due to the dispute over the rule of law.
The Commission has already delayed approval of Poland's plan to tap 36 billion euros from the EU's recovery fund for economies hit by the COVID-19 pandemic.
And it is under pressure from the European Parliament to go further and use a mechanism to withhold EU funding from countries that violate the rule of law.
"Poland should respond to this blackmail from the EU with a veto on all matters that require unanimity," said Ziobro, head of the small Solidary Poland party, without whose votes the current government would lose its narrow majority in the Sejm.
"Poland should also consider its commitments in the EU's energy and climate policy, which lead to a sharp increase in energy prices," added Ziobro.
If the dispute continues, I will demand that Poland stop its contributions to the EU.
It would be justified given the fact that the EU is illegally withholding funds from the common budget, to which we also contribute, added the Polish minister.
His party is more radical in its approach to the EU than the ruling Law and Justice party.
According to the European Commission, the changes that the Polish justice system has undergone under Ziobro's leadership threaten its independence and subordinate it to politicians.
According to Ziobro, Brussels is setting "impossible conditions, because its goal is not the rule of law, but a change of government in Poland".
Warsaw is facing "political blackmail and an attempt to undermine the democratic decision of several million Poles," Ziobro said.
He said Poland should be part of an EU based on a partnership of sovereign states, not a government of the strongest and a Brussels bureaucracy not under democratic control.
He said his party would never accept such concessions from Brussels that would limit Poland's sovereignty.
"We will never agree to Poland having the status of a colony," he said.
But to get to grips with it... We have one type of cheese in four different places at Lidl.
I didn't look for other things, I met one yogurt too many, I only needed cheese, parmesan, after ten minutes at the milk shelves I gave up and asked.
They had it, it's true, in that narrow sector there were all the selected, less common and special cheeses, but it was between the vegetables and the lactose-free zone...
If I avoid it, I won't even smell any market, action or inaction, the gold shop on the square, they may not have such a selection there, but they usually have everything I need and it has some kind of order, so I'm done in ten minutes.
I went to Lidl to buy my holiday.

When I was a child, I was punished with a wooden spoon.
It was never because of grades, it was mostly because I repeatedly refused to listen and misbehaved (read instead of going to bed, fought with my brother, etc.).
At the same time, I was never punished without warning. My mother always threatened that if I did it again, I would get a hit (sometimes even after another "scolding" with the cooking pot, she would only bring it and place it so that I could see it).
Only after I repeatedly refused to listen did I get a couple of slaps on the bottom (through my clothes).
Personally, I think that physical punishment (in a reasonable manner and amount) is beneficial, because the child reacts to it much more than to words.
I think the part with the warning is important, because it gives the child a choice whether to disobey and get it, or to improve and not get the punishment.
I was usually just warned to start listening.
Defense of the system
When the prominent Czech lawyer and constitutional judge Vojtěch Cepl answered a journalist's question in 1999 about what the Czech constitution means to him - whether it is a sacred document on which one swears and which one is taught about since childhood in school, or, on the contrary, an agreement that can be changed if necessary - he definitely leaned towards the first concept.
Once we agreed on the democratic rules of our life in the constitution, which at the same time define who we are as a state and its citizens, it is better to save changes.
And imagine: some nations even like their rules.
Just as Czechs like dumplings with pork and cabbage, Vojtěch Cepl asked at the time.
However, in recent times, there has been a growing opinion among lawyers that the Czech Constitution needs to be changed.
Over the years, it has been tested by situations that its creators (including Vojtěch Cepl) could not have foreseen, such as the behaviour of the directly elected president.
But Cepl was right about one thing.
Everything we know about such documents suggests that political interference in their texts must be deliberate.
The Institute must be understood and actively defended, only then can it be the key to overcoming most of the crises that societies have faced throughout history.
The constitution is, among other things, a set of rules of government consisting of individual rules that set the limits of the game for politicians.
We fear that power will be abused against minorities or individuals, so we tie the hands of politicians with bans.
At the same time, however, the constitutional texts also allow politicians to exercise their power.
Covid doesn't choose, several-month-old baby is fighting for its life in Brno University Hospital
Although it is known that the coronavirus is milder for children, there are also severe cases, which hospitals have been dealing with mainly recently.
"We know that children are less at risk and affected than adults, with 2 to 5 percent compared to adults," said Petr Dominik, the head of the Pediatric Anesthesiology and Resuscitation Clinic at the University Hospital in Brno and the Faculty of Medicine at Masaryk University, to Novinky.
The course is usually much easier, lighter, and often symptom-free.
But there are children who are seriously ill with the coronavirus, which we have seen in particular in recent times," added Dominik.
According to the doctor, there are dozens of children who need mild supportive care.
It is set in a children's infectious diseases clinic.
Children with coronavirus who are very seriously ill are only recently being admitted to the ICU.
Children with post-Covid syndromes have been in the ward continuously throughout the year, according to the doctor.
"Now we're seeing an increase in children with acute COVID pneumonia, which means an inflammation of the lungs that requires a stay in the intensive care unit," he said, adding that the disease affects not only adults but also adolescents and several-month-old babies.
Children are also in critical condition in hospitals due to the coronavirus.
"Currently, we have a child of several months of age and an adolescent in our care," said the head of the department.
However, she is pleased that the children's hospital at the Brno University Hospital has not yet recorded any child deaths from the coronavirus.
According to available data, six children aged 0 to 14 died in the Czech Republic on 6 December.
According to Dominik, a psychologist is an integral part of the collaboration in the children's hospital - not just in the coronavirus ward.
It also points out that, just like in adults, vaccination in children also reduces the severity of the disease and at the same time reduces the occurrence of the post-COVID syndrome.
"That's why we recommend the vaccine for children," the doctor added.
In the rest area, you can only walk along the marked paths.

Skiing/cycling in the forest off-piste is not allowed anywhere unless you have an exemption (but of course it's not really monitored outside of national parks).

China is building the impression that it has the epidemic under control and that the authoritarian regime is better at dealing with the crisis
Sinologist Jirouš: China is building the impression that it has the epidemic under control and that the authoritarian regime is better able to cope with the crisis.
China has launched a medical and political offensive.
A few months ago, Beijing was on the defensive over its failure to contain the outbreak that became a global pandemic.
Now, the country is reporting zero new infections.
Countries including the Czech Republic are competing for Chinese protective equipment and Chinese doctors are helping in the fight against the coronavirus in many places, including the worst-hit Italy.
How do you see Beijing's willingness?
Is it friendly support or is the communist regime trying to improve its image in the world?
A friend meets a friend and says: "Hey, do you want an elephant?"
I have it and it's great.
The wife is happy because it mows the lawn, washes the car, and the kids play with it.
No, it's just great.
If you want to buy an elephant for 5000, I'll sell you one.
Friend: Yeah, I'll just do it, it'll be great...
After some time, they meet and the one who bought it complains: you bastards, what did you sell the elephant for????
The lawn is trampled, there are huge piles of manure everywhere, the car is broken, the children are afraid of it, and the wife wants a divorce.
The one who sold it says: You're talking badly about the elephant, you can't sell an elephant like that...
World affairs are controlled by the great powers.
Although sovereign states are equal, it is the great powers that determine the course of international affairs.
Europe can only become a great power if it works on its integration.
It is currently functioning at the economic and political level (on selected issues), but military integration is still lacking.
Personally, I think Europe is heading towards federalisation.
It won't be in 10, 15 or 20 years.
But in the middle of the century, the mood will be different and it will work.
I also thought of it and it is quite possible.
I'm not an expert in Czech, so I may be wordy.
I'm just going on the fact that an ellipse usually includes 2 different units on the same level.
I will borrow an example from another comment "Spanish oranges and mandarins", where it is clear that they are both from Spain, whereas with "Spanish fruit and mandarins" it is not clear that the mandarins are from Spain.
Plus, I'm basing it on the fact that the sentence says "all American forces," which includes their weapons, and I know that American complexes are operated by Americans only.
In other words, I expect that it is already included in the broad term and there is no need to specify it for American forces.
But again, I'm just a wordsmith :D
Whatever the case, it's a ridiculous request

British woman Vicki Holland tortured monkey Milly
The chilling footage shows the terrified monkey cowering in a toilet bowl before its callous owner flushed it and laughed at it.
Holland also fed the monkey sausages, kebabs and hamburgers, regardless of its actual nutritional needs.
Gwent Magistrates' Court has now banned her from keeping animals for life, The Sun reports.
The monkey rehabilitation experts who are caring for Milly after her ordeal say they have never seen a spaceman so terrified.
Milly spent almost two years in rehabilitation with staff at Monkey World in Dorset and is now happily playing with another rescued monkey called Moon.
The mother-of-four admitted two charges of causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal.
She was given a 12-week prison sentence, suspended for one year, at Gwent Magistrates' Court.
Holland was also sentenced to 120 hours of unpaid work, banned from keeping animals for life and ordered to pay 12,000 Czech crowns in court costs.
Head of the Small Monkeys team that rehabilitated the abused animal, Steph Sawyer, said: "Milly is doing well but the rehabilitation will continue."
It took Milly a while to get used to people again.
She would crouch and hide from anyone she encountered and any loud sound or sudden movement would cause her to scream.
The monkey refused to eat for a long time.
Even now, when she has settled down and is happy with her mate, the sight of new people can still cause her to panic.
The psychological scars of the abuse will stay with her forever, says Sawyer.
The abuse of Millie came to light after police in Gwent discovered the disturbing footage on the woman's phone following a drugs raid on her home.
The footage shows Milly swearing.
In another video, Holland can be heard offering the monkey cocaine and saying: "Do you want some coke?"
So lick my fingers.
In May, she and her partner Russell Cox (43) admitted to possession of cocaine with intent to sell.
Cocaine worth £1,600 (about 50,000 Czech crowns) was found in her home, hidden in Kinder eggs.
Cox was jailed for 30 months and Holland was given a suspended sentence of 20 months.

Everyone goes through it, and the vast majority won't even bat an eyelid and will tell you they couldn't care less.
So what are they fucking learning?
I'm a big fan of the general overview and the fact is that people don't want it and don't need it.
And at that point it's pointless and you'll never get it into them anyway.
Part of it is learning for all the people who are going to need that thing.
But as for the remark that you don't need all this when you're standing by the machine, I meant it absolutely seriously... ...because you don't need it.
Plus, we're slowly getting to the time when not knowing is a mark of punk.
(Which is probably due to our communist past and our dislike of intellectuals and elites) But the price of having barbarians standing by those machines is just too high.
If only the journalists could count, the COVID-19 pandemic would probably never have reached these dimensions.
Wedding at first sight: The war between Kadri and Andrey continues!
Which is the main reason why Switzerland can't leave right away," Andrea replied on Instagram in Stories to all-purpose questions from curious fans, what she was so disappointed in Kadri that she decided to end all contact and even block him on social networks.
There was tension between Kadri and Andrea from the start of the experiment.
The main problem was that Kadri lived and worked in Switzerland and his idea was that Andrea would move there with him, at least until he returned to the Czech Republic for good.
She resolutely refused, however.
And as you can see, their relationship did not end in love, but rather turned into mutual disrespect and hatred.
It was your planned attack! Kadri fired back in response to Andrea's accusations of lying, gambling and debt.
Kadri's alleged honesty now doesn't sit well with his ex-wife or his younger sister Linda.
She decided to publicly defend her brother.
I don't normally talk about things like this, and we never really talked about these things in the family.
I certainly don't want to evoke any pity.
But when I see someone trying to publicly hurt and smear the name of someone I love so much, I just can't take it!
I'm sorry that I have to do this in this way, but I would like to publicly thank my brother Kadri for being a character and helping our family when we needed it most, despite his young age.
I am even more disappointed when I have to read such false information, which is probably taken out of context.
I wish everyone could know Kadri like I do, like our close friends and family, in response to Andrey's words.
I am really grateful to him for everything!
Of course people will believe what is written, but the most important thing is that we, his family, love him above all and we know the truth and we know how it really was, she added vaguely.
The drunk thief climbed up the facade to the fifth floor.
You won't believe why.
Chao began his crime spree in a parking lot in a residential area, where he tried to break into several cars.
According to available information, he eventually stole less than 330 crowns from one vehicle.
He then had no better idea than to climb to the fifth floor and enter the apartment through an open window.
There he stole two bananas.
A security camera then caught him walking down the street away from the scene of the crime, eating a banana.
When the apartment owner woke up in the morning, he found the bananas were not where they were and called the police.
She then detained Cchaa.
The man admitted that he had drunk some alcohol on the day in question.
And since he needed money, he decided to rob while drunk.
The whole thing is still under investigation.
The drunk climbed up the facade to the fifth floor, where he stole two bananas.
The pandemic law is time-limited and its effects are tied to the state of pandemic preparedness.
When that is repealed, the law will not be in effect.
The law does limit the scope of business
Is that not enough of a reason?
The right to assemble will be restricted, but not abolished.
More than 60 percent of voters turned out for Saturday's elections to the councils of four municipalities
New councils were elected on Saturday in the towns of Komňa in Uherskohradišť, Lužice in Most, Nová Ves in Liberec and in Rovné in Pelhřimov.
The number of councillors in these municipalities has fallen below the number set by law or the elected councils have collapsed.
A total of 99 candidates were running for the 28 seats on Saturday.
The average age of the newly elected representatives is 46.7 years.
The oldest is 69 years old, the youngest 33.
The processing of the results of Saturday's elections symbolically closes a rather demanding but successful year for us.
There were a total of four new or repeated elections to municipal councils and, above all, very closely watched elections to the Chamber of Deputies, said the vice-chairwoman of the ČSÚ, Eva Krumpová.
She recalled that the elections were more demanding in terms of equipment and personnel security due to the COVID-19 epidemic.
In Komňa in Uherskohradišť, the Association of Independent Candidates won Saturday's election, receiving 27.76 percent of the vote and two seats in the seven-member council.
The STAN candidate received 24.84 percent of the vote, which also means two seats.
Občané pro Komňu also won two seats in the council, with 18.52 per cent of the vote.
The current mayor of the village, Jana Křižková, who is a member of the Soukromníci, also got back into the council.
The Komňans - independent candidates - won one seat in the council.
75.48 percent of eligible voters went to the polls.
The association Pro Rovnou won in the village of Rovná in Pelhřimov.
It won 50.50 percent of the vote, which means four seats out of seven.
Two representatives from the Association of Independent Candidates 1 and one from the Association of Independent Candidates 2 were elected to the municipal council.
Voter turnout was 93.62 percent.
The Lužice and Svinčice Association, led by Mayor Jindřich John, won the repeated elections in Lužice in Most.
It won 56.73 percent of the vote and, like in 2018, has four seats in the seven-member council.
The second place went to the Municipal Party for the People, which received 43.27 percent of the votes, so it will have three representatives in the council.
76.7 percent of voters went to the polls.
Independent candidates Naděje pro Novou Ves won the elections in Nová Ves in the Liberec region, ahead of the ANO movement.
The Association of Independent Candidates received 59.88 percent of the vote and won four of the seven seats on the city council.
ANO received 40.12 percent of the vote and strengthened against the regular elections in 2018, gained one more mandate and has three.
Voter turnout was 42.9 percent of voters.
The State Election Commission will discuss the election results on Monday.
They will then be published in the Collection of Laws.
What do you think is the bigger problem?
A dead civilian or a foreign politician?
I think you know all this stuff that people are writing to you.
You're just playing the fool to have someone to "argue" with.
If not, it's sad.
I'm not saying that Christians are degenerates, or anything like that.
I even like a lot of church buildings from an aesthetic point of view (which was, after all, the point, to make them look good).
And I don't care who believes what.
On the other hand, I find it annoying how much power the church had in the Middle Ages, how much money it made, the suppression of science, etc.
Not to mention all the wars it has caused, e.g. the Thirty Years' War
Tl;dr: Believe in the spaghetti monster if you like, but the state and the church have nothing to do with each other
The man fell head first from twelve meters.
He survived the impact with the concrete.
An unbelievable fall was survived by a man in Ostrava on Sunday night, who was attended to by paramedics from the Regional Emergency Medical Service.
The county's emergency operations center received the 911 call an hour after midnight Saturday with initial information about the man falling from a height.
Two emergency services crews - medical and paramedic - were immediately dispatched to the scene.
On arrival at the scene, paramedics discovered that the 27-year-old man had fallen out of a window from a height of around 12 metres and landed on his head on concrete!
In Vítkovice, coal was caught.
But not as it should have been, and the firefighters went to work.
On arrival of emergency services the man was unconscious, with multiple injuries and in a life-threatening condition.
The attending physician intubated his respiratory tract, provided artificial lung ventilation, and after further measures as part of pre-hospital emergency care, the ambulance transported him to further care at the Ostrava trauma centre, informed the spokesman for the ZZS MS region, Lukáš Humpl.
I'm more worried about the inadequate response of the public and the authorities than I am about the coronavirus
The spread of the coronavirus in the Czech Republic is a challenge for politicians and officials, but doctors and medical staff are at the forefront of the fight against the infection.
How serious is the situation from their perspective?

Legendary Nunes falls after seven years, Oliveira defends the belt
MMA experienced a great gala evening full of interesting results.
Things happened at UFC 269.
The outsider Julianna Peña managed to defeat the legendary wrestler Amanda Nunes, who had not been defeated for seven years.
Charles Oliveira didn't hesitate in the lightweight division, submitted Dustin Poirier with a great choke and defended the belt.
Also victorious was Kai Kara-France, who quickly swept aside Cody Garbrandt with a technical knockout in the first round.
He also defeated his opponent, Sean O'Malley.
A surprise that no one expected.
This was brought about by the women's bantamweight bout between the famous Amanda Nunes and Julianna Peña.
The American entered the bout as a sort of "underdog," as Nunes had not lost in seven years and was looking to continue her winning streak.
The start of the duel was also in line with the paper predictions.
Nunes started the fight very actively and even delivered a push kick to her opponent, which sent her to the ground.
However, Peña was not going to make any more mistakes, and she herself unsuccessfully tried to attack with a lever on the hand.
The second round was gripping and very tense for MMA fans.
Both rivals traded a lot of good punches and hard hooks.
Penney then threw Nunes to the ground, where she began to strangle her.
She had to give up her efforts and fend off the attack.
The American woman thus caused a huge shock when she became the new champion.
The main event was the lightweight title bout between Charles Oliveira and Dustin Poirier.
At first, Poirier was doing better, but the cards gradually started to turn against him.
In the second, Oliveira tried to be more active, trying to lock his opponent in a hand lock.
This didn't work out too well for him, but then he created a lot of pressure, got his opponent on his back and hit him with a series of blows.
This is why he won the second round.
In the third round, Oliveira showed a rear naked choke, which Poirier resisted for a while, but then had to tap out.
The Brazilian defended his title, while Poirier lost after two years.
In the next match, Sean O'Malley scored a sovereign triumph, putting a hard right back on Raulian Paiva in the first round.
He then knocked him down with a series of precise blows and recorded his 15th triumph.
Kara-France then beat Cody Garbrandt.
In the spring, Nunes celebrated another triumph with her young daughter, now she lost after seven years.
That hip, or that hip?
At first glance, it doesn't seem like anything complicated.
Most nouns in Czech express only one grammatical gender, so there is no problem in determining whether they are masculine, feminine or neuter.
Then there is also a fairly large group of nouns whose gender is not fixed.
Such substantives oscillate between two genders.
When inflected, they acquire double endings and in some cases remain in the uninflected form.
For example, the words "svízel" and "kyčel" are both masculine and feminine, in the first case they are inflected according to the pattern "stroj", in the second case according to the pattern "píseň".
In another group of nouns, the forms are different even in the singular first case, for example: "řádek/řádka", "kedluben/kedlubna" or "brambor/brambora" (in the sense of food).
Both forms are standard, have the same meaning, and are therefore freely interchangeable.
Some words may differ regionally, for example "okurka" in Bohemia and "okurek" in Moravia, but in this case the Moravian variant is not standard, and the same is true for other Czech-Moravian pairs of words: "příkop" and "příkopa", "kobliha" and "koblih", etc.
Some words that have entered the Czech language from other languages were originally uninflected, but they are gradually taking on Czech endings.
A typical example is the word "image", which is both masculine and feminine, or the word "buffet", which has remained in the middle gender without inflection, but in the masculine has endings according to the pattern of "castle".
Turkey has opened the way for migrants to Europe.
What is the situation like on the Greek border?
There is tension on the Greek-Turkish border as a growing number of migrants try to make their way into Europe.
Thousands of people have been heading towards the southern edge of the Schengen area since Ankara stopped holding them back.
European politicians are promising Greece support, and the Czech government is also preparing humanitarian aid.
What actually motivates refugees to take this uncertain journey?
And what is the situation on the ground?
We haven't seen blue sky for three months and we're suffocating, says Sydney journalist
The devastating fires that have been plaguing Australia for four months have killed nearly three dozen people and hundreds of millions of animals and destroyed millions of acres of land.
How are the authorities and the people themselves coping with the disaster?
Could the Prime Minister Morrison's government have done more to prevent the drastic impact, critics say?
And what will the country have to prepare for in terms of climate change in the future?
Lenka Kabrhelová speaks with journalist Ika Detrichová from Sydney.
False accusations are always and have always been rare.
That is why everyone is always written about everywhere.
People are uncomfortable with how sexual violence looks in our society and how widespread it is, so they try to ignore it.
I don't know anyone personally who has been falsely accused.
I know a lot of people who have been raped and I have seen how the people around them and even the police often treat them.
Victims should always be believed.
A trend has emerged of victims finally opening up about their traumas.
However, too many people keep it to themselves.
Yes, there are those who falsely accuse others.
It's disgusting and spitting in the face of all the victims of sexual violence, but by spreading the idea that "a lot of the accusations are false" and that it's a "trend" you're only helping the sexual predators.
Scattered houses flood the Czech Republic, families have no money to finish them
The price of building materials has risen by more than 30 per cent in recent weeks and months.
Many people have found themselves in a tight spot because of it.
She does not have the means to finish the family homes she has built and the banks are refusing to increase her mortgage.
In addition to the cost of materials, the cost of construction work is also increasing.
People therefore do not have enough money to finish the family homes that have already been set up.
In many cases, banks are refusing to increase mortgage loans, creating an extremely unpleasant situation.
At best, people move into makeshift and unpermitted homes.
In the worst case, the scattered houses are uninhabitable and families are forced to sell them because they cannot afford to pay off their mortgages and also pay rent," says BHS economist Štěpán Křeček.
We build two to three family homes a year, and fifty percent of the time it happens to us.
It's difficult for us as a construction company, because we have to stick to some of the contractual things, even though the materials have gone up in price.
So we do it for free," said the owner of a construction company, Zdeněk Slivoň.
A lot of people are going to have financial problems.
If they were counting on the house costing five million, now it will cost them seven.
I think some will wait," added Slivoň.
The most expensive materials were copper, iron and also plumbing and heating equipment.
Construction firms are also struggling with a shortage of labour.
There is a shortage of graduates in construction-related fields in the Czech Republic, and the pandemic is slowing down the influx of foreign workers.
The situation is more favourable in terms of issuing building permits.
"In October, the building authorities issued 7,675 building permits, which is almost 10 per cent more than a year ago," Křeček clarified.
We are doing well and we will do even better.
A real vision is missing, says ČRO – mujRozhlas commentator
In addition to the traditional celebrations, the start of the new year has traditionally been accompanied by speeches from politicians.
This year, in addition to the Prime Minister and the Chairman of the ANO, Andrej Babiš, and the Christmas message of President Miloš Zeman, the Presidents of the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies also addressed the nation.
What did we learn?
I think the master's thesis is great just like that, I have my own topic that I have chosen, I am building on my bachelor's degree, I always work on it for a whole year and then I write the written part in a week or two.
The state police are completely calm here, unless you are a total monkey and have something left in your head, the committee will not unnecessarily choke you with theory.
I studied for the state exams for a week, and when I was running out of ideas, the commission always tried to lead me to some logical deduction, which I immediately understood, and I was right.
Otherwise, to those projects, I know people who pay someone to do their semester project for them (we did it a lot, it's really beneficial, you learn a lot) and then they just learn the project and they're done.
I think it's great when there is a test at the end of the subject, which reflects the knowledge gained through the project, not just a defence.
All well and good, but don't flood the embassy with emails and phone calls and don't send any packages to the embassy.
You'll be just like them.
Those people at the embassy may not have anything to do with it.
And if they were against Russia, they would be taking a big risk, so maybe they have to play them, because otherwise something could happen to them.
But you can just as well put a similar statue of Putin next to the statue of Pú the bear.
Even if it means putting it so that it reaches Xi Jinping's behind or something like that.
I agree, even though Insta is throwing artists under the bus.
If you don't post stories every day and at least a new picture every other day, your reach will drop to a bare minimum.
On top of that, they keep changing which function is more important, whether it's a like, a comment or a save.
I'm getting really frustrated lately, so maybe I'll have to go down to TikTok, where a lot of artists in my industry are having success and they don't really care about it.
I'd even be happy if something more user-friendly came along that didn't suck all the creativity and energy out of artists
Statement of the Donbass Workers' Party
The Union - yes, the dissolution - no, say the opponents of the dissolution of the USSR in the picture.
Thirty years since the illegal dissolution of the USSR.
On December 8, 1991, the greatest geopolitical catastrophe in the history of mankind took place.
On December 8, 1991, Boris Yeltsin, Leonid Kravchuk and Stanislav Shushkevich, without any legal authority and in violation of the results of the referendum of March 17, 1991, with the open tolerant attitude of Mikhail S. Gorbachev, secretly, without regard for the people, signed an agreement that "the USSR as a subject of international law and as a geopolitical reality ceases to exist".
With one stroke of a pen, they "abolished" a huge country with almost three hundred million inhabitants.
With the collapse of the USSR, tens of millions of ethnic Russian citizens found themselves abroad.
Since the early 1990s, Russia's population has fallen by ten to eleven million.
Even without the loss of the non-Russian population of the former Soviet republics, we have already lost more people than in both World Wars combined!
Even earlier, the same people who in one sitting in the Belovezhskaya Pushcha forest destroyed what had been built over the previous seventy years, betrayed the socialist camp (created at the cost of millions of lives in World War II and in the Great Patriotic War).
They deliberately de-industrialised, slowed down agriculture, and pulled away from the world's greatest power, the 14 republics that had been economically linked in a single mechanism.
If we want to look even deeper, we see the impoverishment of the population, the collapse of the economy, science, the military, the growth of crime, inter-ethnic conflicts, the war in Chechnya, all the conflicts in the post-Soviet space, a series of orange revolutions, the expansion of NATO to the east, the war and the breakup of Yugoslavia, the Arab Spring, the war in Syria - all of this is the result of geopolitical capitulation, the first surrender of the socialist camp, and then the Soviet Union.
There is a term in political science called "power vacuum."
All that was hastily betrayed and surrendered was quickly filled and taken over by the NATO countries that accepted our geopolitical surrender.
And the world is still reeling from the events of the late 1980s and early 1990s.
The price of a product sold in a large-turnover supermarket does not necessarily correspond to its quality and value.
It's Monday and we have some meat in the supermarket that costs 189 CZK/kg.
I'll buy it and put it in the fridge and make it for dinner on Thursday.
In an alternative reality, where I don't buy the meat on Monday, the chain will reduce its price to 99 CZK/kg on Tuesday - describe to me the mechanism by which the meat, by changing its price, becomes a burden on my digestive system?
Or I can wait until Thursday and the meat will be discounted one day before the sell-by date to 69 CZK/kg - how would this meat differ from the one I bought on Monday for 120 CZK/kg and left in my fridge for 3 days?
I'll answer myself - nothing.
This talk about the fact that if something is cheap, it must be definitely bad, spoiled or of poor quality is really retarded, to be honest ;-)
Recently, I went to Hlavas in Brno and a lady was handing out some kind of brochure in the underpass. I always take such things to help the volunteers, they can't throw it away...
No, the pamphlet was full of common sense and conservative views on how the world works, but there was nothing about God, I was confused, but I knew it was going to be some kind of agitprop.
After reading it, I found out who published it and it turned out to be Scientology.
No, it was a good matron, full of completely useless advice, like I should wash and not be a pussy.
It's a waste of paper, and the rainforests wouldn't have to be cut down for this.
I had a similar experience with an ex-girlfriend.
Psychological manipulation and emotional blackmail will force you to comply with that person because you love them without realizing how screwed up the situation is.
She threatened to hurt herself a few times because I went out to talk to a friend she didn't like.
Or when I wanted to leave her apartment early, she started to cry and begged me on her knees not to leave.
She then began to physically block the door.
It was a great relationship for about a year, but then another six months passed and it started to beat her up.
I then ended the relationship by telling her that I was breaking up with her, but that we could talk about it again next week to calm her down and prevent her from going crazy again.
Such a person will suck the city, emotions and overall joy out of you.
It's better to keep your distance
When insurance companies are frantically buying up clouds of tests and chasing after the positives who wouldn't even know about this terrible disease if it weren't for the test.
All we are doing is causing trouble for companies, carriers and others because their employees got five days of house arrest from the random number generator.
In the west, they have stopped with this nonsense and admitted that there is no point in dealing with a disease weaker than the famous flu.
Unfortunately, Válek is new and has to steal something and boost his ego by making up bullshit.
I see that the old good gossip is coming back.
After years of decline and suppression of this unfair business, MLM recruiting is back in the spotlight.
I was one of the recruits, I gave it a go (I was 20 years old, a first-year university student), the initial promises of product and business skills training quickly turned into "you don't need to care about that, just get people".
I was genuinely interested in the products I was selling because I wanted to help people, but the training was more about how to scare and talk people into buying.
When the first money came in, you quickly realized that if you wanted to make money, you had to push a few certain products a month.
Investment life insurance and mortgages were the only profitable, so you felt like a travelling pot salesman.
What I can say, however, is that it was a valuable experience, and I learned not to jump on every rumour and to check information thoroughly.
At the same time, I would not put them all in the same bag.
There are people in this business who are successful and even beneficial to people, but they certainly won't be boasting about expensive consumer goods or "fat" accounts.
I haven't seen much of this in the corporate world where I work.
HR is calm, managers are minding their own business, and they don't stick their noses into our business.
Regular evaluations do take place, in the form that it happens here (set some goals for next year, in a year's time we'll see what worked and what didn't) - it's more of a self-evaluation than someone evaluating you by some numbers, and so on.
Corporate events are also optional.
But we are a bit unique within our company - there are departments that are more "corporate".
Sometimes you feel like we're a quasi-startup squatting in the offices of a big corporation.
But it works well for us as long as the results are there.
The Czech woman missing in Britain is dead.
Her body was found in London.
British police have been searching for a missing 32-year-old Czech woman for nearly ten days, who disappeared at the end of November.
On Sunday, 12 December, the former Minister of Foreign Affairs, Jakub Kulhánek, announced on social media that the woman from Uherské Hradiště had been found dead.
The British police unfortunately confirmed to our representative office in London this afternoon that they have found the body of the missing Czech citizen.
The cause of death is under investigation.
Due to the family, we will not be releasing any further information on the case.
My sincere condolences, Kulhánek wrote on Twitter.
The young woman was last seen on November 28 on a bus on her way home from work. She had just withdrawn money from an ATM.
Her disappearance was reported to the police by her work colleagues five days later.
The London police then began to search for her, and Interpol included her in the list of missing persons around the world.
She also appeared in the Czech database of missing persons.
The police have already arrested one man in connection with this.
She did not say what role he was suspected of playing in the case.
Four municipalities elected new councils at the end of the year
On Saturday, 11 December, new councils were elected in the municipalities of Komňa in Uherskohradišť, Lužice in Most, Nová Ves in Liberec and Rovná in Pelhřimov.
The number of councillors in these municipalities has fallen below the number set by law or the elected councils have collapsed.
In the new elections, 99 valid candidates competed for 28 seats.
Voter turnout was 62.41%.
The highest turnout was recorded in the village of Rovná, where 93.62% of eligible voters voted.
The mandate was won by a total of 8 women and 20 men.
The average age of the elected representatives is 46.7 years.
The oldest is 69 years old, the youngest is 33 years old.
A total of 13 candidate lists were registered for the new elections to the councils of the four municipalities.
36 women and 63 men competed for 28 council seats.
The average age of the candidates was 46.6 years.
The youngest candidate was 22 years old, the oldest 72.
The processing of the results of Saturday's elections symbolically closes a fairly demanding, but successful year for us.
It saw four new or repeated elections to municipal councils and, above all, the very closely watched elections to the Chamber of Deputies.
We had to work in more difficult epidemic conditions, which placed greater demands on equipment and personnel security, said Eva Krumpová, 1st Vice-President of the Czech Statistical Office.
The last precinct was reported at 3:49 a.m. on Sunday, December 12.
The State Election Commission will discuss the results on Monday, and after approval, they will be published in the Collection of Laws.
This is the biggest problem I have with the whole pandemic.
It took me a while to get used to the fact that we have a very dangerous contagious disease here, but it went without any major problems.
I have a problem with the way a large part of the population at all levels of society is so idiotic about it.
I'm most looking forward to the vaccination (tomorrow!) because it will finally make me less dependent on other people not being assholes.
He would be removed from the presidency and disqualified from ever holding it again.
However, as others have mentioned, the chances of this actually happening are very small.
Moreover, I'm not sure that copying a file would even qualify as treason.
Treason is an act by which the President of the Republic endangers the sovereignty, territorial integrity, or the democratic character of the state.
It had to be something more serious.
How the pandemic has affected intimate life: The number of people under 35 who have not had sex for a year is growing
More and more young adults in the U.S. are living their lives without sex.
It is mainly religious people, says the DailyMail website.
The survey found that between 2008 and 2021, the proportion of people aged under 35 who abstained from sex rose from eight to 21 per cent.
Women aged 18 to 35 who said they did not have sex in the past year is at an all-time high.
Other factors are also contributing to the decline in the number of sexually active individuals, according to a survey by the Institute for Family Studies (IFS).
One of them may be the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic and the higher unemployment rate.
But the presence of the media, social networks and video games, which make sex less and less of a priority for young people, may also have played a part.
"Since 2010, there has been a rapid increase in the share of men and women aged 18 to 35 who report not having had sex in the past year," said IFS researcher Lyman Stone.
People in relationships are more likely to be sexually active, with just 5% of them saying they had not had sex in the past year in 2021.
For singles, it was 29 percent. Stone added that marriage under the age of 35 is only a small percentage.
The decline in sexual activity is also due to the fear of premarital sex and religious beliefs.
While married couples are more likely to be sexually active, the percentage of married and cohabiting women aged under 35 is still falling.
Young people are divided on premarital sex, with about 30% saying it's wrong and about 70% saying it's okay.
"It's true that they are a minority among single people in this age group, but their behavior is shifting the trend," Stone says of the 30 percent.
Most of those who have a moral problem with premarital sex do so for religious reasons.
Since 2008, the rate of abstinence among single people under 35 who attend religious services more than once a month has increased from 20 per cent to almost 60 per cent.
Among the "less religious," the trend has risen from 10 to 20 percent," Stone said.
Other factors, such as less social interaction and social drinking during the pandemic, have also contributed to the decline in sexual activity.
The study also showed that people who are unemployed or have lower incomes are less likely to have sex.
Another reason could be the expansion of digital media, which apparently reduces the need for sex.
People are spending more time online, which is "replacing" this need.
This trend has taken hold mainly during the lockdown period of the coronavirus pandemic.
The whole COVID vaccination mandate is about whether society should force a portion of the population to do something they don't want to do, but that could save their lives.
It's a pretty tough question, and the one I'm most interested in personally is the question of social conscience.
For example, the question of whether if we don't tell them to do it and they die, it will be our fault.
My argument is that we could certainly be responsible for the death of an 80-year-old man who didn't really know much, we didn't explain it well to him, he heard some misinformation, and as a result, he didn't get vaccinated and eventually caught it and died.
On the other hand, I don't think we can be blamed for the death of a determined opponent of vaccination, who, alongside the SPD and the KSČ, has been ranting about bullying and a totalitarian state.
From the statistics I mentioned, it is quite clear that most of the unvaccinated pensioners probably belong to the second group, so they will have to pay for it themselves.
The Czech Republic without snow.
How will a mild winter affect the fight against drought?
This year's winter has brought one of the smallest snowfalls in recent times in the Czech Republic.
Ski resorts cannot do without artificial snow, and the weather also complicates the preparation of the cross-country skiing Jizera 50.
Is this a trend or an exception?
What will the lack of snow mean for the fight against drought in the Czech Republic?
I have one story, but it's not about the pan-fryer.
One time in middle school, our teacher took us all over town to the boatyard so we could take a boat ride down the river.
On the way there, we walked down a fairly wide street and in the middle of it we didn't see anyone - a follower of the Hare Krishna sect.
Of course, they came down on us.
I was lucky enough to escape, but one of my friends got into a conversation.
When she left them, we asked her and her teacher what she had told them.
"They asked me if I wanted to save my soul.
I told them I don't have a soul," she replied.
We all laughed all the way to the boatyard, including the teacher.
We're so pampered.
Not much is happening, but the system is already collapsing, says Orozovič
New German Chancellor Olaf Scholz arrived in Warsaw on Sunday after previous visits to Paris and Brussels, where he was greeted with military honors by Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki.
"We are opening a new chapter in our relations," Morawiecki said at a joint press conference after the meeting.
Scholz stressed that Europe must show together that it will not accept the violation of Ukraine's territorial integrity.
The chancellor said that the crisis caused by the disturbing movements of Russian troops near the Ukrainian border should be resolved through diplomatic negotiations, including within the "Normandy group", which includes France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine.
Morawiecki said he informed the chancellor about the situation on the Polish border with Belarus, whose leader Alexander Lukashenko has artificially created a migration crisis and uses people as live targets and weapons, because we record hundreds of attempts to (illegal) cross the border every night.
I have been talking to the Chancellor about further sanctions to make the Lukashenko regime and its patrons in the Kremlin understand that we are determined to defend the EU's eastern border.
According to the DPA agency, Scholz assured that Warsaw enjoys German support in the dispute with Belarus and condemned the inhumane treatment of refugees by the Lukashenko regime.
Drunk Polish nun caused accident, tried to cover it up
The car returned to the scene of the accident after a while, but it was driven by another nun who was trying to take the blame.
When the police told her that she could still lose her driver's license for not giving way and leaving the scene of the accident, she came clean, TVN24 reported.
She admitted that another nun had crashed into the vehicle and asked for her help.
The police then came for Celestine's sister.
She was breathalysed and her licence was immediately revoked after she was found to have more than two-and-a-half times the legal limit in her blood.
At the same time, they informed her that she would be questioned about her actions in court.
Hugo the dog is doing his best.
Juraj Šajmovič, however, did not keep an eye on his film.
Czech creators of family comedies have looked at American stories about pampered dogs.
They forgot one important thing though: the laws of the film industry.
After the kitsch film F. Brabec's Gump - the dog who taught people to live, another film is now competing for the audience's emotions in the cinemas, Tady hlídáme my.
The co-writer and director in one person, Juraj Šajmovič Jr., loosely follows his previous film Tady hlídám já from 2012.
The talking hedgehog Hugo is back on the scene, along with some familiar characters around him.
Julie and Ivan, the owners of a dying pension in the Šumava mountains, start inviting dog owners, Julie's father with his partner and especially her daughter Veronika.
She is no longer a little girl, but a young woman experiencing her first love.
The director and his partner, Beatriz Šajmovičová (who is also the film's producer), struggled with the storytelling in the previous dog film, but at least the children and the dog were entertained there.
This time, the writing duo has written an even weaker script that evokes a mixture of awe and feelings of embarrassment.
Let's recap.
Julie, despite being a scientist, succumbs to the darkness of her desire for a child, and when the right "constellation" comes, she copulates with her forest engineer Ivan, wherever the coordinates just determine - on the hood of a car or a church tower (of course during an ongoing excursion with a local guide), the retired colonel Mojmír, despite years of training, shoots his own daughter (Julie) in the forest, who falls into a coma, after which she is taken to the hospital by her family, so that a miraculous healing process can take place in the heart of the Šumava wilderness.
Nothing wrong with a bit of nature therapy and the power of animal cuddles.
Their owners know why they have them.
The viewer is amazed at how much content, full of unbelievable situations and characters, was needed for this message.
A pair of thieves from the staff, a dog-fighting competition, a South Bohemian charlatan, police officers arriving on a tip to look for "drugs" and discuss the fertilizing power of bone meal over herbs - and of course the baked family in the pension gets drunk.
When the heroine wakes from a long coma and immediately sits at the family table, made-up and smoking a cigar, demanding her father's whiskey and a pat on the back as a recovered vegetarian, you can't help but laugh.
On top of that, the creators explain to the viewer that "this sometimes happens after a coma."
Šajmovič's team lacks basic dramaturgical knowledge of working with the text, the ability to build up the main situations, a sense for the characters and the point, and direction.
The acting is uneven, the editing is aimless, and the overall effect is muddled.
As much as Lukáš Vaculík, Jitka Ježková or Nela Boudová try to keep their parties going, they don't have much to play for.
The only positive aspect of the film remains the poetic shots of the Šumava nature by cameraman Vladimír Holomek and the pair of badgers.
It is not enough to sketch out a few characters, a flimsy plot and dog-like utterances, not to mention the more common vulgar expressions that the characters indulge in.
Neither is the long-standing membership of the Badger Breeder's Club - as in the case of the lady producer.
For good intentions to promote nature and the friendship between man and dog, there must also be a knowledge of the craft, if one wants to tell a believable story.
This was not the case in this instance.
There is a little too much eroticism and a minimum of feeling for the genre in a good family photo.
Even as an advertisement for canine therapy, this amateurish piece wouldn't pass.
Yes, respect, because they have to listen to constant insults from idiots like you.
There is a difference between offering and forcing, here you can see how you understand this shit, but that is only because you have never tried it.
It's always up to the customer, if they don't want it, the answer will always be no.
If you listened to a kid like that all the time, you might change your mind.
It's just a job like any other, in this case a side job.
The Middle East is experiencing unusually dry months.
Winter is the only time of the year when it rains.
"The almost complete absence of rainfall during November, as recorded at some stations, is unusual," the Israel Meteorological Service confirms.
For example, the village of Kfar Giladi in northern Israel reported only six percent of its long-term average rainfall for November.
The two-day rain from this week was therefore more of an exception.
It's good for us.
It hasn't rained for a long time.
It is also the right Christmas backdrop, rejoiced the Nazareth resident Wasim Ashkar.
Rainfall in Israel comes almost exclusively in the winter months, is sporadic and irregular.
The forests are dependent on winter rains.
Without them, they dry out and are prone to fires.
It's not just forests, but also drinking water and irrigation for farmers.
Israel's largest freshwater source, the Sea of Galilee, filled to the brim this spring thanks to three consecutive rainy winters.
Since then, the level has fallen.
The water managers have been warning about the drought for a long time.
"It is expected that, depending on global warming and climate change, there will be less rainfall here," said Uri Schor, spokesman for the Israel Water Authority, in 2018.
Israel can help with technologies such as desalination or recycling of waste water.
Economically weak countries such as Lebanon, Syria and Jordan are worse off.
In the streets of Jordan's capital, Amman, tanker trucks are becoming more common.
The water mains and private wells are drying up.
"This year, my orders have gone up by 70 to 80 percent compared to the previous two years," tanker driver Imad Suleiman said in September.
Clashes broke out between farmers and security forces in Iran's Isfahan.
The reason for the protests was the drought.
The bed of the local river was completely dry.
The region has experienced its driest November in many years.
Israel prepares military strike against Iran
The Israeli defense minister said the Vienna talks had made "no progress" and that he had informed Washington of preparations for an attack on Iran's nuclear facilities.
Defense Minister Benny Gantz said Saturday that he had ordered the Israel Defense Forces to prepare for the possibility of a military strike against Iran, Jonathan Lis reports.
Gantz, who is in the United States, is trying to convince Americans to increase pressure on Iran, but he is also informing Washington about military preparations.
During a press conference in Florida, Gantz said the nuclear talks in Vienna have not made "any progress" and the world powers "understand that the Iranians are playing with them."
This happened to me about three years ago.
I grilled the lady a little bit and grilled her during the interview to find out what she actually wanted from me.
In the end, I discovered that my suspicions about the pyramid were justified.
Since I really don't like these tricks, I continued to doubt and ask questions of the lady for a while, and finally thanked her and left.
Feel free to call me a scoundrel, but a pyramid is a pyramid and financial advisors are financial advisors.
Skiers headed to the mountains over the weekend, where there was plenty of snow and good weather
The Czech mountain resorts experienced their first major influx of skiers this weekend.
After a heavy snowfall at the end of the working week, there is no shortage of snow and some ski resorts have opened as a result.
The downhill skier was not deterred by the requirement to show a Covid certificate at the lifts.
While tow-boat operators are not complaining about a lack of customer interest, some ski-rental companies are reporting lower demand for their services than before the epidemic.
Thousands of people in the Liberec region went cross-country skiing and downhill skiing over the weekend.
The weather was kind to the skiers, who were treated to sunshine and excellent snow conditions.
"We are satisfied, the opening weekend really started with the Friday evening skiing, when we had the first skier on the hill," praised the interest of the Director of the Ještěd Sports Area, Jakub Hanuš.
Hundreds of people headed to the Jeseníky Mountains for the first weekend of skiing in the new season.
For example, the Ski Aréna Karlov and the centre in Branné in Šumpersko were open.
Weekend attendance was very good, with an estimated 400 people on Saturday and today.
The conditions are great.
Today the sun was shining, it was about minus three degrees, so perfect, Rostislav Procházka, the representative of the ski resort in Branná, did not spare the praise.
Ski resort operators can only sell lift tickets to people who are vaccinated or have recently had COVID-19.
With the exception of a few, people are prepared and show the necessary documents, said René Hroneš from the Špindlerův Mlýn ski centre to ČTK.
"We've only had a handful of incidents," he added.
Some ski rental and equipment stores are reporting lower demand than before the pandemic.
Fortunately, there is interest in renting skis.
It's not like in previous years, but there are still enough customers, said Alexandra Bokišová from the Opava Skiopava store.
They expect more pressure during the ski season.
David Šinták, the manager of the Hradec Králové company Snowbear, also feels that there is less interest in renting ski equipment due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
By the time of the pandemic, we were already on borrowed time.
Compared to the period before the pandemic, we are at about 50 percent, Šinták told ČTK.
According to him, people have become lazy during the pandemic and have learned to sit at home.
On the other hand, the rental agency at Novako in Boží Dar is experiencing high demand.
They started renting skis a week ago and those interested have to order them in advance.
"We're starting to rent out skis this weekend, but people have already called ahead, so we're expecting a lot of interest, just like last year," said the venue's operator, Pavlína Nováková.
According to her, the interest in the ski school is also comparable to the pre-epidemic period.
If we want successful and wealthy people to stay in the country, they must be able to live a quality life here as they do abroad.
Socialist health care, where it is often difficult to find a dentist or specialist doctor, is certainly not part of it.
The smart and capable people who don't have any property here are leaving the country.
The owner of the company doesn't just go abroad.
I agree with the rest of it, though.
If these people do not live well in the Czech Republic and if these people do not have a reasonable future in the Czech Republic, then they will not live in the Czech Republic.
The emigration from Hungary began when one day Orbán won, he ruled for a year and suddenly the annual emigration rose by a few tens of thousands.
It is naive to think that the Czech Republic cannot find itself in a similar position overnight.
Another question is whether there will be elections at all.
If it's a bad place to live, it could also be won by some traditional V4 lunatic.
The young and educated will leave, leaving behind his supporters and people whose property doesn't fit in a plane.
Scary photo!
Langmajer in the blood for a beer bet?
While autumn was in full swing in the Czech Republic, the crew of the film The Island, led by Jiří Langmajer (55), was enjoying the tropical weather in Thailand!
The actor posted a bloodied photo of his face on social media.
Is it a real injury or is it makeup for a shoot?
The London police are still looking for the missing Czech woman.
She was last seen on her way home.
"Petra's disappearance is completely out of character and we are becoming increasingly concerned for her welfare," said Lucy O'Connor of the Lambeth police station, where Srncova worked, in a Saturday video.
"Her family in the Czech Republic are also very worried about her and just want to know where she is," she continued.
According to her, the missing Czech woman left work around 7:45 p.m. on Sunday, November 28 and headed home to the Camberwell district.
She was last seen on a bus about half an hour later.
Her disappearance was reported on December 3 by one of her colleagues.
According to British media, Srncová worked as a "nursing assistant" at the Evelina London Children's Hospital, which is part of the Guy's and St Thomas' hospital group.
"We are extremely concerned about our dear colleague Petra who is missing," the group of medical facilities said in a Twitter post.
"We would ask anyone who may have any information which could assist in locating her to contact police," the statement continued.
MP Harriet Harman also called on the public to come forward with information about the case, which she raised at a press conference on Saturday.
"She's been missing for a few days, she's only 32 years old, she's from the Czech Republic, her parents are understandably distraught," said the Labour politician, holding up a photograph of the woman distributed by London police.
"I feel like we all have a particular responsibility to try and find her because she was away from home, away from her family and working here for our health care," Harman said.
Police have previously arrested one man in connection with the case, who remains in custody.
However, the BBC news website reports that the police have not released any information about his identity or what he is suspected of.
Russia is not capable of occupying Ukraine, and certainly not with 30 BTG (i.e. about 5 divisions).
I don't underestimate Ukraine either.
This is not "a huge amount", but about 8 percent of the Russian army.
Notice that Ukraine is constantly repeating that we are exaggerating the threat of invasion and is starting to get fed up with our presence.
I quoted above.
I don't know where he got the idea that Russia wants war.
War is a hell of a lot of fun and Russia has the GDP of Italy.
The comparison to 1938 is so far off in so many ways that I don't even know where to begin.
I can already compare it to the First Punic War and the "annexation" of Sicily :D
I can imagine that after Ukraine announced that it would not abide by the Minsk agreements, Russia annexes those ridiculous republics.
That is all there is to it, and that is what the "concentration" at the borders would correspond to.
Yes, pacta sunt servanda...
New timetables come into force in Prague from Sunday, mainly affecting suburban services
Passengers in Prague's integrated transport (PID) can expect several changes from Sunday, which will mainly affect suburban connections.
New lines have been created, some have changed their routes, and others have disappeared.
The Mladá Boleslav region is now joining the integrated system.
From Sunday, express trains from České Budějovice will stop in the capital at the Zahradní Město station.
The S7 suburban trains will run on the route from Beroun to Český Brod, passing through Prague's main station.
The recently opened station in Prague-Zahradní Město will now be served by the R17 express train from České Budějovice and Benešov.
The PID will now be extended to other areas.
The buses will go as far as Světlá nad Sázavou, Blatná near Jesenice, Staré Splavy and Turnov.
Buses in the Mladá Boleslav region will be included, including lines with connections to the Liberec and Hradec Králové regions.
77 lines will be cancelled, 37 new lines will be introduced and the operation of 12 existing lines will be adjusted.
A new bus line 405 will depart from Prague's Zličín and will go all the way to Žatec.
A new direct connection between Prague and Kralovice near Rakovník has also been created, replacing the cancelled S53 train line.
The services from Prague to Rakovník will be strengthened in the morning rush hour and at the weekend, when the new express line number 404 will run.
The 400 and 410 lines to the Liberec region are now included in the PID system.
They depart from the Střížkov metro station, not from the Holešovice train station.
The 400 spine line runs through Mělník, Dubá and Česká Lípa to Nový Bor, and selected services continue to Rumburk or Cvikov.
The additional line 410 runs through Mělník and Dubá to Doksy, Mimona and Jablonné v Podještědí.
On the other hand, the operation of dozens of local lines in the Central Bohemian region has been cancelled or restricted, including lines to Mochov, Dobříš and Rožmitál pod Třemšínem.
All trains leaving Prague at 02:30 have been cancelled.
Due to the modernisation of the railway, long-term restrictions continue on the lines Prague – Beroun, Prague – Lysá nad Labem and in the vicinity of Kolín.
Changes are also coming for passengers at other locations.
Buses are replacing some of the cancelled train lines or the section of line 420 from Dobříš with a connection from Prague, where it is possible to use PID tickets all the way to Milevsko.
The routes of lines 540 to 543 in Nymburk have been changed, and the routes of some buses on the border between Central Bohemia and Hořovicko in the Plzeň Region have been adjusted.
Healthy office snack/lunch from the supermarket
Hi, I do the standard 9-5 with a 30min break and my only option to get food is to go next door to B&M or down the road to Lidl.
Since I don't have any movement, after work I don't have the strength to exercise, so I have to eat as healthily and on a diet as possible.
Unfortunately, I never know what to buy and in a hurry, I buy at most a pizza bagel and for a snack, a yogurt and an apple.
Question: What healthy food that does not require cooking would you recommend I buy at the supermarket?
Not everyone waits for a metre of snow like you, so unfortunately that's how it is.
And it's not just trees that you have to see.
Only the tip of the tree can hide under the snow.
If damaged, the tree may be more susceptible to fungal diseases.
I'm not saying it's the only reason they're not allowed to ride off-piste, but it's one of them.
Dara's confession about her relationship with Nedvěd: I didn't look forward to this at all
The Czech show business pond has been nothing but the revelation of the relationship between Dara Rolins and Pavel Nedved since Friday.
They have been together since the summer, and the famous footballer even got a divorce because of the singer.
Dara has now sent a lengthy message to her fans, explaining why she kept her love a secret from them for six months.
"I dare to say that there is currently no one in the Czech Republic or Slovakia who does not know that Dara caught a bear, i.e. pardon, Nedvěd," jokes Dara Rolins, who is head over heels in love with the most successful Czech footballer.
He is said to have dumped her, not the other way around.
Three days in the spotlight, and although they are used to public attention, they don't enjoy it.
And it's here.
What we both didn't look forward to, but we knew it would happen one day, the singer continues.
I just don't know who's worse off.
Whether it's those who don't care at all and it comes out of the can on them, or us, whose lives are being scrutinised in minute detail.
As if someone wanted to hear your opinion on whether you fit well with your husband or girlfriend, or whether you insisted that everyone know in detail the list of your former partners and be familiar with the list of your mistakes and errors.
That's what you want, that's what you want, that's what you want, that's what you want, that's what you want, that's what you want, that's what you want, that's what you want, that's what you want, that's what you want, that's what you want, that's what you want, that's what you want, that's what you want, that's what you want, that's what you want, that's what you want, that's what you want, that's what you want, that's what you want, that's what you want, that's what you want, that's what you want, that's what you want, that's what you want, that's what you want, that's what you want, that's what you want, that's what you want, that's what you want, that's what you want, that's what you want, that's what you want, that's what you want, that's what you want, that's what you want, that's what
The couple got together in Italy, where Rolins was travelling to prepare for her new fashion collection.
Nedvěd has been working as the vice-president of the Juventus football club for a long time.
They only came out with the truth now because they were waiting for the conclusion of Nedvěd's divorce.
He and his wife, Ivana, have been separated for three years, and have only been legally divorced for three weeks.
Nevertheless, we thank those who rejoice with us and wish us well.
We are just people, we have families, children, pasts and dreams.
We're not perfect, but I think we both have our hearts in the right place.
That is why I love my new man and just as he stands by me, I stand by him. For better or for worse, concluded Rolins.
Hi, other commenters have probably said everything important, I just confirm that the dorms are great for the beginning, my classmates mostly met and became friends during the first semester or two and then found a shared apartment together, which seems like the best option to me, because you know who you will be living with.
Apartments are usually not advertised very far in advance, so you probably won't find much now, but it won't hurt to look at the listings.
Otherwise, definitely avoid not only Cejl, but also the surrounding area (streets like Vranovská, Francouzská, etc., that's a pretty bad address), and some parts of Židenice are a bit ghetto.
On the other hand, the Veveří district is very student-oriented, Královo Pole and the direction towards it is nice, and it is close to most of the VUT faculties (I don't know where you are going to start).
I have never looked for a rental, but I am a native of Brno, so I can advise you on Brno in general if you need any more information.
This is an example of "normal" thinking to me.
Because of what a few doctors decided to do somewhere in Poland, it is actually perfectly fine that the state does not sufficiently fund some schools.
Either they can learn what they want and pay for it themselves, or they can follow the state's curriculum and the state will pay for it.
We cannot allow a private actor to control a part of the education system just because he adds a few crowns to the full state contribution and can therefore teach whatever he wants in schools.
Such a statement loses some of its weight when it is written by a person who two days earlier wrote this about a petition calling for a boycott of the totalitarian state:
So a vote against someone having an abortion is the same as a vote against a statue standing in a square?
I would consult directly with the person who gave you the job.
Otherwise, I have already experienced during the cataloguing/digitisation that (and even long-term professionals) either guess it by eye or write something like xxx *** or ... (according to convention) and in the note that it is unreadable.
The truth is that in this case it is quite readable, so I would not recommend it.
Personally, I would deal with it by making a note, depending on what program you're using.
If you want to be a proper and diligent student, you can look up some branded databases and find the nearest one.
But since it looks like you're drawing from a book, I would guess that the author or printer simply created their own mark that fits with what is physically on the coin.
PS: It is not by chance that it is the Kingdom of the Odrysae rather than the Kingdom of the Odrysans?
PSS: Someone has already cracked it here.
Check out that comment with ΦΙΛH
Politicians don't even know what the "theme" of our presidency will be.
That is a much bigger mess than having interpreters with them.
The idea that they would approve something because nobody understood some text is laughable.
All important approved documents are examined word for word, and a basic knowledge of English is not enough for this, it is a matter for lawyers.
Hundreds of translators and interpreters work in the various EU institutions, and English is more suitable for politicians to use in informal contacts and to establish special relationships.
In addition, it is quite interesting with the English, after GB's exit from the EU.
I don't understand the hate for Ceylon.
I've been working there for three years and I'm doing just fine.
I drive home from work at 10 p.m. all the time and never have a problem.
Only someone who has hardly ever set foot in the ghetto can say that it is a ghetto.
Yes, most of the Roma population of Brno probably lives there, but all they do is block the sidewalk and park where they shouldn't :D it's definitely not that I'd be afraid to go out on the street there at night.
So if you are looking for relatively cheap accommodation with good access to the city centre, I would go for it.
There are a lot of newly renovated or newly built apartments there.
Felix Slováček (78) without Dada and his mistress Gelemová as a stick in the fence!
Who is he spending Christmas with?
On Sunday, most people lit the first candle on their Advent wreath, but Felix Slováček did not.
I don't have an Advent wreath, so there was nothing to light.
I've seen the wreath and Lucie probably has one too, said the saxophonist to Blesk, thus confirming Patrasová's words that she often visits her.
He visits, but does not live in their house in Vinohrady, where Dáda was left alone after his departure.
Slováček still doesn't know where he will be on Christmas Eve.
We recently met with Anička, Felix and their two grandchildren.
VIDEO: Felix Slováček and Lucie Gelemová: TOGETHER AGAIN!
Felix Slováček and Lucie Gelemová: TOGETHER AGAIN!
But we were still talking, so Christmas didn't happen.
I really don't know where I'll be.
I buy gifts all the time and I'm sure I'll buy something for Dad and Lucia, probably perfume.
I'm a gentleman, added Felix, who came to the music video launch himself to the Richman club.
I'm here alone, but I don't feel alone.
I always find someone to have fun with, says Slováček, who was happy to meet the wife of Luďek Sobota, Adriana, or singer Kamila Nývltová.
And he made it clear.
And we are Iceland, so we can afford not to have soldiers and weapons?
I doubt that anyone will defend us, and our location is so strategic that an aggressor would have to be a complete idiot not to occupy this territory.
And I don't understand why it should be a bad argument, can you explain that to me?
I don't know of any other component that could be deployed in hospitals in a crisis.
There are not enough police officers and they cannot afford it, the same goes for firefighters and nowhere else is there such a high percentage of medically trained people at such a level.
And the fact that our army is capable of defending just enough Ostrava is a slap in the face of previous governments, not the army, which has been asking for new toys for a long time.
Record drought in the Czech Republic.
It is necessary to change agricultural subsidies, the countryside is not just a food factory, says the journalist.
The Czech Republic is experiencing its worst drought in years.
According to scientists, the water has decreased in the mountainous and foothill areas, and even places that have not yet experienced a shortage of moisture are recording smaller amounts of precipitation.
The drought in much of Central Europe is caused by climate change.
However, the impact is also exacerbated by the way we manage the soil.
What should you do to prepare for a drought?
And how can we help nature in these difficult times?
Yes, it will be like that, I can barely keep my skates on the ice, I know what hockey is and the tactics (which I tried in Franchise Hockey Manager) are also generally a load of rubbish.
And whether you're the "Russian Bear" hockey team or the "Chinese Lama" team, losing by two goals when you don't have to win the game at all costs is different than when it's tied.
But anyway, what I hear from the Czech commentators, what the referees notice and what they don't notice, whether it's men's or women's hockey, it's all strange, but that's how it is with all sports, UEFA and "Italian actors" or motorsport F1, WRC, etc.
Controversy is everywhere.
And in my opinion, if it was the other way around, it would be like it always is, and that the Czech Republic and Russia have lost more often than they have won, it would probably be the classic "they lost" vs "WE won".
Coronavirus: Russia's caseload tops 10 million
On Saturday, December 11, the Czech Republic recorded 9,080 daily infections.
5766 people are hospitalised.
In total, 34,451 people died in the Czech Republic, and another 74.
There are 1967 confirmed cases per 100,000 in the last 14 days, and 871 per 100,000 in the last week.
The number of infections in Russia exceeded 10 million on Sunday.
In the past 24 hours, 29,929 new infections have been registered.
It's the lowest daily count since Oct. 13.
The total number of registered cases in Russia is 10,016,896.
The daily death toll is 1,132, the lowest daily death toll since late October.
Britain is facing an "inevitable" large wave of infections caused by Omicron, Dr Susan Hopkins, chief medical adviser to the UK Health Security Agency, said on Sunday.
New quarantine measures will be required.
People with Omicron are already in hospital in the UK and Hopkins expects that number to rise.
So far, no one has died from omicron, but hospitalizations occur about 14 days after infection and deaths about three weeks after infection.
Labour leader Keir Starmer said on Sunday that Boris Johnson appeared to have broken the law by holding a Christmas quiz at Downing Street in December last year, when a lockdown was in place and Christmas parties were banned.
One minister in Johnson's government defended the quiz as having taken place "virtually" on a computer.
However, it was attended by groups of staff gathered around computers in Downing Street.
Pressure is mounting in Britain for Johnson to step down as prime minister.
During last December, when a strict lockdown was introduced in London and Christmas parties were banned, Johnson's ministers held numerous parties despite the lockdown.
The British public and media are furious that Johnson and his government have been making a mockery of them:
Paul Brand, ITV's political editor for the UK: Two years ago today Boris Johnson won a landslide victory in the general election.
The Conservative Party is talking this morning about removing him as prime minister.
Remarkably, events have moved so quickly.
Do you want to turn and save your skin?
Hungary is due to hold elections in the spring that could end Viktor Orban's 12-year rule.
They will be elections of pan-European importance.
How fair can you expect them to be?
They won't be fair.
They will probably not be free either, as the last two elections under Orbán were not free.
His Fidesz party controls the media, changes the boundaries of electoral districts to its advantage, and does other small or large tricks.
The most recent one sounds like everyone can vote in practice, wherever they want.
This will allow Fidesz to transport voters from decided districts to those where the result is uncertain and the opposition could win.
So I'll just repeat that they won't be fair at all.
Do you think it will be as unfair as in 2014 and 2018?
The situation is very different, after all.
It used to be about whether Fidesz would win, but how much and whether it would have a constitutional majority.
Now there is a real chance that the united opposition will win more votes and seats.
This is a big change for Viktor Orbán and his party.
Will they try to hold on to power by playing even harder?
Yes, we have some indications that they are prepared to go beyond what they have done so far.
Recently, a recording of the Speaker of Parliament and one of the leaders of Fidesz, László Kövér, was leaked to independent media, in which he explains to the heads of the secret services that the opposition is a threat to national security.
Those are the hints of a new approach you're talking about?
Yes, that is one of the new features.
It all starts with the tongue.
I was beaten quite often, the last time when I was 14, my mother doesn't have much patience, I don't either, my father has a lot of patience, but then he hits me extremely (only in relation to me).
I am also very choleric and I used to get very angry when I was little, to the extent that I would lie on the floor in a fit of rage and turn blue, and they would have to take me under the shower to calm me down.
They would sometimes spank me to teach me a lesson, and sometimes it was more like they didn't know what else to do.
I definitely have a tendency to solve things with violence now too, as a child I fought quite a bit, now I at least hit something to let off steam, and when I was younger, I might have slapped my parents across the hand, for example (so that I didn't get hit too hard), so never anything extreme, but I always have this urge.
I can't say to what extent it's my temper, but I'm sure my upbringing has something to do with it.
I'm afraid I'll lose my patience with my own kids and deal with it the same way.
I think that hitting children is just wrong and that my parents shouldn't have done it, especially not at that moment when it was no longer "educational," but out of frustration, on the other hand, I think every parent just screws up something, it's probably impossible not to offend their children a little bit, so I don't blame them.
I'm not offended by it, I don't understand why the OP should be ashamed of it.
Laws should be clear and unambiguous.
I would call Kundas those who create laws of such quality.
Otherwise, I'd be interested to know if you're afraid of losing your income?
Can you really count on people wanting the product and buying it, and will you have enough to pay your mortgage?
Kočner's monstrous world.
Where will Slovakia move the trial of the killers of journalist Kuciak?
The main trial of the four accused of the murder of Ján Kuciak and Martina Kušnírová begins in Slovakia.
The death of the investigative reporter and his partner changed Slovakia.
It mobilised civil society, but it also revealed the practices of the accused businessman Marián Kočner and his connections to the top of Slovak politics and justice.
How will the trial be a turning point for Slovakia?
The journalists are to blame for this.
How is it possible that this petition received a lot more media attention than the counter-petition by the deans of all the medical faculties, which came out a day or two later?
On the contrary, they let themselves be fooled and the company bounced back.
People were dying of Covid on Czech television as recently as six months ago.
Another government ends and the law on the involvement of municipalities in the selection of storage facilities is nowhere to be found
Minister Karel Havlíček's proposal needs a major overhaul
The government of Prime Minister Andrej Babiš is coming to an end and the law that was supposed to ensure respect for the interests of municipalities and their citizens in the selection and approval of deep storage of high-level radioactive waste still does not exist.
The government's legislative council suspended consideration of the proposal, which the Ministry of Industry and Trade submitted to the government after years of delays.
However, its content is in serious conflict not only with the affected municipalities associated in the Platform against the deep repository, but also with the Union of Czech Towns and Municipalities.
Municipalities expect a significant strengthening of their decision-making powers on the repository, which has been promised to mayors since 2011, when the first work on this legislation began, and which is required by the Czech Atomic Act and the European Directive.
We expect the new government to revise the proposal in accordance with its coalition agreement in cooperation with the municipalities.
The draft law from Minister Karel Havlíček, which is available to the Platform, is criticized by municipalities in particular: The proposed level of involvement of municipalities and the public in the decision-making process on the selection of a site for the repository is insufficient and cannot ensure respect for the interests of municipalities and their citizens.
It can only be truly effective if the municipalities or the public can influence whether the process will continue in a given location.
This can be ensured by requiring the Administration of Depositories to request the consent of the affected municipalities before starting a specific procedure.
The proposed real estate plan almost entirely neglects the involvement of the public and makes the citizens of the municipalities practically mere extras in the permit proceedings.
The draft is missing a system of compensation for municipalities for the entire process of finding and selecting a site for the repository, its approval and operation.
According to today's legal standards, representatives of municipalities do not have many options to defend the interests of their citizens in the search for a storage site.
Only in some authorisation procedures can they submit their comments or appeal, but the authority or minister in whose interest the permit is to be issued makes the decision.
A potential lawsuit does not have the effect of delaying the carrying out of survey or construction work.
The co-decision of local authorities, which the Platform is calling for, is a principle that is commonly used in many democratically advanced countries and certainly in those that have already made progress in allowing storage facilities, such as Sweden and Finland.
The preparation of the law is another failure of the state administration, which hires external law firms to prepare legislation.
In this case, it is a contract with the law firm HAVEL & PARTNERS s.r.o., which was concluded by SÚRAO and follows on from contracts with lawyer Jan Zemánek.
According to the contract register, the total sum for this work is almost 4 million Czech crowns.
Antonín Seknička, deputy mayor of the village of Cejle from the Hrádek area and spokesman for the Platform against the Deep Repository, said: After the ministers of industry, who only postponed the alignment of the position of municipalities towards state authorities in the search for a deep repository for highly radioactive waste to their successors, we expect a more significant turn from the new government.
We also offer a helping hand.
We would also like to thank the Association of Towns and Municipalities, which sees the issue of insufficient rights of municipalities in such a crucial construction project in the same way as the directly affected municipalities in selected locations.
The platform against the deep repository brings together 51 members (35 municipalities and cities and 16 associations) to promote a change in the state's approach to the management of spent nuclear fuel and other radioactive waste, which will not be limited to the deep repository.
The platform also advocates that the decision on the selection of a site for possible storage should be subject to the prior consent of the affected municipalities.
John Goodman (69) was scared into losing weight: He lost 90 kg.
Although he had no need to change his lifestyle for many years, in the end he was scared by the doctors.
He was told that if he didn't lose weight, he would die.
And it took.
Goodman has lost 90 kilograms, which is half of his original weight of 180 kilograms, The Sun reports.
He showed off his new look in Los Angeles at the premiere of the animated series The Freak Brothers.
The fat guy from the Roseanne sitcom is a completely different person!
John liked to joke that his friends and family asked him to lose weight because his large body was causing furniture to break.
"I was putting everything in my mouth," the actor said in a 2018 interview with AARP.
This time I wanted to do it slowly.
Move, exercise.
I'm getting to an age where I can't afford to sit still, said ABC's Goodman, whose transformation is remarkable.
It also depends on what kind of boss and what you want to use the word "boss" for.
If it's some text on a platform that expects readers from a gaming environment, I wouldn't translate it at all.
If it was a formal text, for example a university text, I would probably look for a way to describe or explain the boss.
And there are different types of bosses.
For example, a game like Dark Souls etc. has several bosses, right, and so a "boss" is something like a lord/ruler of a given level, and then there's the final boss...
Many games have hidden bosses (super bosses, hidden bosses) that are not necessary to beat in order to complete the game or level, but are often stronger than regular bosses.
Then there are games like Half-Life, where the bosses are there, but the player doesn't directly fight them (Tentacle, Gargantua), and can they be called bosses at all?
And then there are the mini bosses.
It is not possible to translate boss in one word, Czech and other languages do not solve it (Catalan, for example, is interesting, as it translates boss as the final opponent).
It is, in short, a computer-controlled opponent that is significant to the story or the game in general, stronger than all previous ones, and guarding the completion of some level or task.
The whole world is looking for the missing Petra from London.
The Czech police were also involved.
The British police have been looking for the missing Petra Srncová since 3 December.
The Czech police have also been involved in the search.
The 32-year-old woman from Uherskohradišť has been missing since 7 December.
Interpol is also helping the British police.
Petra Srncová's colleagues last saw her on November 28.
British police have been looking for her since December 3.
Interpol issued a so-called yellow notice for her.
The whole world is looking for Peter.
"The Czech police are working closely with the British police," confirmed police spokeswoman Kateřina Rendlová.
"We are sharing information on the case," she added.
The announced search for Petra has already appeared on the police website.
She is described as being 5ft 6in tall, slim, with brown eyes and long straight brown hair.
It is supposed to come from the Uherskohradišť region.
Petra worked as a nurse in one of the London hospitals.
Her friends and colleagues are worried about her, as this kind of disappearance is very unusual for her
Local MP Harriet Harman also got involved in the search for Peter.
She was involved in putting up flyers with Petra's face on them.
"We are very concerned about her," she said at a press conference on Saturday.
In connection with the disappearance, British police have already arrested one suspect.
It is not clear who he is or what he had in common with Petra.
Agent Tesla is terrorizing the Czech Republic before Christmas.
While October data showed a slight decline in attack campaigns, last month saw a significant uptick as the year drew to a close.
We recorded a major campaign in relation to Agent Tesla on 18 November.
The attacks are specifically targeted at the Czech Republic.
The attackers' strategy remains the same for now.
The infected attachment in the email is designed to grab the user's attention with a name that refers to payments and financial transactions.
While last month the dangerous attachment had the word invoice in its name, this time it was marked as Copy of corrected invoice 11.2021...exe," said Martin Jirkal from ESET.
The spyware includes features that scan web browsers and other programs, such as Microsoft Outlook, Mozilla Thunderbird and Yandex email clients.
The malicious code actively searches for stored login credentials, which it then sends to the attackers.
The last major campaign in the Czech Republic took place at the end of August and beginning of September, and with the approaching holidays and the end of the year, the activity of the attackers is again on the rise.
In November, the Formbook spyware remained active.
Unlike Agent Tesla, the attackers in this case are not specifically targeting the Czech Republic, and security specialists have detected campaigns with a global reach in November.
Compared to October's Formbook data, Formbook weakened slightly in November, but still accounts for almost a fifth of all detections.
The attacks were continuous throughout the month with increased activity on the 3rd, 10th and 15th of November.
The Formbook most often contained an attachment with the .exe extension, which was named REQUEST FOR SPECIFICATION.
However, the name "receipt" continues to be used.
The Czech attachment can then be much more dangerous for the Czech user.
Security analysts have noted a significant decline and dampening of activity in the Fareit program, which was responsible for 1.6 percent of attacks and has not had a major offensive campaign in the Czech Republic in recent months.
Today's demo of smart people who don't need oxygen because oxygen is for vaccinated idiots.
The march through Prague was larger than the media reported.
According to the footage of the parade along the embankment and my experience as a demonstrator, I estimate that there were around 10,000 people.
The people in the procession filled the embankment and the bridge and the opposite embankment road.
That means there are a lot of people.
The march of about four thousand protesters is spontaneously joined by an unprecedented number of passers-by.
I believe that something new is being born here, writes Radek Mokrý.
That persistent discontent among several large groups or layers of the population led to them finding common ground.
The anti-vaxxers, anti-maskers and the like would not be able to fill or pay for such a large parade.
The events of the Chcípl pes association are on the rise in popularity, it reminds me of the Million Moments for Democracy.
Sometimes I get the impression that they even rent the same stage and the same equipment.
It is hard to say what kind of movement could be bribed from this dissatisfaction, it depends not only on the supply of money, but also on whether the three-dose Pfizer vaccine does not become four or more doses.
It will definitely not be a left-wing or centrist movement, you can bet on that.
The three-dose vaccine is almost certainly going to become a multi-dose vaccine, because it's clear that we're going to have to get booster shots every six months.
I'm very glad that the vaccines saved us.
A brilliant act of science that humanity is right to be proud of.
End of an era, Bulgaria has a new prime minister calling for change
Bulgarian President Rumen Radev has tasked Kiril Petkov of the anti-corruption movement We Continue the Change, which won the November elections, to form a new government.
He has already managed to form a broad coalition government that should take office in a few days.
The political crisis in the country has been going on since April, when the previous government lost the elections under the weight of anti-corruption protests.
The victorious parties that had pledged to fight corruption and abuse of power were unable to reach an agreement, so two more early elections followed.
What do cats do when no one is watching?
The "secretly" filmed footage is a global hit.
Concerns grew in the UK over the weekend about the fate of a 32-year-old Czech woman who has been missing for several days in London.
Petra Srncova was last seen two weeks ago as she drove home from work in the south of the British capital.
In addition to the police, her previous employer and the MP representing the part of London where she lived are calling for information about the children's hospital worker.
"This is completely out of character for Petra and we are becoming increasingly concerned for her welfare," said Lucy O'Connor of the Lambeth police station, where Ms. Srncova worked, in a Saturday video.
"Her family in the Czech Republic are also very worried about her and just want to know where she is," she continued.
According to her, the missing Czech woman left work around 7:45 p.m. on Sunday, November 28 and headed home to the Camberwell district.
She was last seen on a bus about half an hour later.
Her disappearance was reported on December 3 by one of her colleagues.
According to British media, Srncová worked as a "nursing assistant" at the Evelina London Children's Hospital, which is part of the Guy's and St Thomas' hospital group.
"We are extremely concerned about our dear colleague Petra who is missing," the group of medical facilities said in a Twitter post.
"We would ask anyone who may have any information which could assist in locating her to contact police," the statement continued.
The Shumperk amateur painter of children's rooms, Zdenka Dvořáková Kocourková (and also a regional Pirate Party councillor), was reported by an anonymous person for violating copyright with her murals.
However, the court ruled that Krteček's murals in the Šumperk rooms do not violate the law.
In Ústí nad Labem, a hole in the road in the form of a canal without a cover lay for a month.
It was a matter of life and death.
The municipality referred complaints to the Road and Motorway Directorate, which owns the road, and because it did not respond, the hole continued to grow.
Eventually, the authorities clarified responsibilities and ownership, and after a month, the Road and Motorway Directorate started to "deal with the situation intensively".
