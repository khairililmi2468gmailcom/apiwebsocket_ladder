The big comeback of the Czech loser is approaching.
Pavel Francouz called up to the NHL
Czech ice hockey goaltender Pavel Francouz, who is going through a difficult period in his career, is returning to the NHL.
The 31-year-old Pilsen native will be on the bench and could soon be in goal.
The former goalkeeper of Litvínov, Plzeň and Russian Chelyabinsk was injured during the NHL preparation in October this year.
He was swapped in the middle of the game with Vegas and since then he has not appeared on the NHL ice.
The incident happened as the experienced goalkeeper moved from one post to the other.
"Pavel Francouz will be out approximately three to four weeks with a lower-body injury," the team announced in early October.
His return to the NHL net eventually stretched to more than two months.
He was called up from the farm on Sunday morning American time, where he had caught four games and showed his old form.
In the AHL, he recorded 94.5% of saves.
The Pilsen-born hockey player wants to finally make it and prove that he belongs in the best league in the world.
He had hip problems in his last season and didn't play a single game in the shortened pandemic season.
In the NHL, "Francík" played 36 games, his save percentage is 92.3%.
Charles' Christmas card features Camille's mask, William and Kate pose in Jordan
British Prince William and his wife Kate have chosen a family photo taken during a trip to Jordan as their Christmas card this year.
Prince Charles also posted his wishes, using a photo of him helping his wife, Camilla, put on a mask at the races.
The British news channel BBC reported this on its website.
They are sending wishes to friends, colleagues and foundations they work with.
The photograph was taken somewhere in the desert.
The Duchess of Cambridge is dressed in a long khaki summer dress, and Princess Charlotte is also wearing a dress.
Prince William, the Duke of Cambridge, is wearing shorts and a collared shirt just like Princes George and Louis.
It is not clear who took the photograph or when it was taken.
Last year the royal family posed for a photograph to be used as a Christmas card in front of a stack of hay bales and a pile of logs at their country home in Norfolk.
The heir to the throne, Prince Charles, and his wife Camilla also released a photograph to serve as a Christmas greeting.
Photographer Sam Hussein captured him at the races in Ascot in June.
Charles, who is wearing a cap and a mask on his face, helps Camille put on her mask, which matches her light-coloured dress.
According to efotbal.cz, Slavia promised Berbr a million for the title, Tvrdík denied it.
Prague - The investigators in the current corruption case are reportedly working on the assumption that the accused former deputy chairman of the Czech Football Association, Roman Berbr, was promised a million crowns by Prague's Slavia for the league title in the 2018/19 season.
The website efotbal.cz reported this, stating that it had access to part of the police files.
The chairman of the Vršovice club, Jaroslav Tvrdík, said that the red and whites did not engage in any corrupt behaviour.
The server published a transcript of police wiretaps, in which the former sports director of Slavia, Jan Nezmar, who left the championship club last summer, is featured.
The former influential official of the red-and-whites was, according to the file, in frequent contact with both Berber and the former sports director of the then second-league Vyšehrad, Roman Rogoz, who is also among the accused in the case.
The police were reportedly working with information that Slavia had promised Berbatov a financial reward for winning the title.
In 2019, the SK Slavia Prague team won the first league title.
The police authority had information that Roman (Berbr) was promised a million-dollar bribe by the officials of SK Slavia Prague for winning the league, the server quoted from the file.
The following day, according to the police, Berbr met not only with Nezmar, but also with the chairman of the board of Slavia, Tvrdík.
According to the server, the file does not indicate whether the police are still dealing with this information.
Tvrdík denied any corruption.
Between 2015 and 2017, we actively tried to change the situation in Czech football and offered an alternative to its development.
We have never committed any illegal acts, we have not tried to influence the referees in violation of the fair play rules and we have not provided anyone with any financial compensation in this regard," Tvrdík told Seznam Zprávy.
In the wiretaps, Nezmar, among other things, indiscriminately insults some former dark-skinned Slavia players and also slanders his former boss Tvrdík.
The case of alleged match-fixing through referees was sparked by a police raid in mid-October last year at several locations including the FAČR headquarters in Prague.
The highest-ranking official involved in the affair is Berbr, who is no longer involved in any of the football functions.
In mid-January, he was released from custody, just like the former sports director of Vyšehrad, Rogoz.
Helicopters, tanks and bvp are cold war larping.
The new tanks will be of a fundamentally worse type (the gunners will have to leave the armoured cabin and carry the ammunition by hand without cover).
The cars - Toyota Hi-luxes - are new and good
Trucks and various armoured vehicles - at a decent level, and in addition, it has managed to get rid of the Praga V3S even in specialist units.
Aircraft: combat - decent, but at the end of the lease, transport - too small with a short range, but modern.
Drones - few and only small types without combat potential
We don't have any rockets (but we manufacture and export them abroad)
NGO: mid-Cold War, outdated; short-range - good, modern, relatively good number.
I have a story.
I have a hunting lodge right next to the city.
The nutria were climbing out of the river and causing damage to the crops, so I sat there.
When I arrived, I saw that there was a fisherman on the other side of the river.
I didn't want to make a mess, so I sat down quietly and the guy probably didn't notice me.
I hoped he would leave before something came out, but of course, the fox came out after a while.
I let her come within 40 meters before I decided to shoot.
The poor fisherman almost pissed himself, he was waving his headlamp all over the place, so I called out to him that it was a fox.
Before I got off the bench, I was livid.
In other words, a man's meadow can be a swamp.
On the other hand, it's not a war, it would have to be a series of coincidences for something to happen, you would probably be seen on a thermal imager, which almost everyone has today.
So, put it in a visible place, put the expensive things at your feet in your sleeping bag and you should be fine.
Vojtěch versus Hamáček.
The Interior Ministry procured respirators at a significantly lower price than the Ministry of Health
The state, responsible for the purchase and distribution of face masks, masks and respirators for professions closest to the coronavirus, has spent billions of crowns on their acquisition in recent weeks.
The iRozhlas server compared the purchases of individual ministries and found that during a single day, the amounts for respirators differed by hundreds of crowns.
Why did prices fluctuate so dramatically?
Which authorities were frugal?
And why did others buy more expensive ones?
Lenka Kabrhelová speaks with iRozhlas editor Dominika Kubištová.
I respect soldiers and the army (I am probably not affected by memories of the Czechoslovak People's Army, which older generations experienced), but the Czech Republic cannot benefit from compulsory military service.
We don't even have large stockpiles of equipment that the trained personnel could use, we don't even have modern equipment for the current professionals, and on top of that, modern equipment is getting more and more complicated, so the skills of the reservists will rapidly deteriorate over time.
In addition, modern conventional conflicts, where people can be deployed, will happen very quickly, and there won't be time to retrain someone.
And finally, the reserves/territorial defence are of great importance for countries like Ukraine, where it is necessary to conduct mass guerrilla warfare and to deter the enemy.
In the Czech Republic, we will only be able to fight in a conflict of such a scale and intensity that guerrilla warfare will be irrelevant, and we do not have the right geography for that.
Mainly, we don't have individual skills.
It's not even the worst part.
The worst part is that half of them play as if they have it.
Then you find yourself in a situation where you're watching a guy who missed an empty net 2 minutes ago, driving into the attack alone between 2 or even 3 Swiss players, and you're saying to yourself "what the hell do you think is going to happen now?"
Of course, they will treat him like an average taxpayer.
The situation with this skill "to dribble past defenders" is so bad that I caught myself being genuinely surprised when I saw that our attacker managed to get past one of the opposing players.
The first swallows
The Covid-19 pandemic is slowing down, but experts do not expect any major change in the coming weeks.
The pressure on hospitals is expected to last for some time according to statistical models, and a new unknown has been added to the pandemic equation: the omicron variant, which is very likely to spread faster than the currently predominant Delta.
At the same time, it is not yet possible to say with absolute certainty whether it can cause a more severe course, how much vaccination or post-infection immunity acquired from having previously contracted the disease helps against it.
This week, however, an unexpected phenomenon on the plus side entered the Covid equation: the possibility of treatment.
A new drug, the antiviral molnupiravir, has arrived in the Czech Republic. It reduces the risk of a severe course of the disease and associated hospitalisation by a third and can be taken at home.
Soon, it should also be complemented by the Pfizer paxlovid drug, which, according to the current results, reports a success rate of even 85 percent.
The first deliveries of molnupiravir to the Czech Republic, in addition to the hope of expanding the portfolio of tools useful in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic, have also highlighted the question of how prepared the local administration is for the incoming medicines.
As mentioned, the first to reach domestic patients will be Merck's molnupiravir.
The company ended up at the front of the pack in part because the drug was being developed long before the current pandemic to find a treatment for a viral disease of horses in South America.
In these studies, it is often overlooked that people in the West (Germany, Sweden, etc.)
are generally less open and do not share their opinions openly.
On the other hand, Eastern Europeans, and especially us Czechs, are used to saying "as if a beak had grown on our nose".
See you do research where you ask people if they like Muslims.
In the Czech Republic, most people will tell you straight out that they don't.
In the West, they will tell you how much they like migration, how everyone should help them, and how we Czechs are racist scum.
And then they go and vote for parties like the AfD.
They're afraid of cancel culture, saying this in public means losing your job and media lynching.
Then it looks nice in the polls, west good, east bad.
But they will find out what people really think.
In France, Le Pen and Zemmour both have more than 20% according to the polls.
We even know that the objects are three and completely identical.
Identical for the sake of rotating units so that soldiers don't have to relearn where things are, all the buildings are essentially the same.
One of them is the Atom Museum Brdy and the other two are abandoned.
It is funny that the USSR did not want to have nuclear warheads on its own territory, either for security reasons or because of the speed of deployment of the warheads due to its more western location.
In those underground shelters (there are two in each maple), only the warheads were stored, not the whole missiles as they say.
If it was necessary to use this weapon, a special unit would arrive to pick up the head and mount it on some kind of carrier.
In addition to the museum maple, the rest of them are in a dilapidated state.
At the second stage of primary school, we had a Gypsy classmate, and we were with him for 4 years.
He was pretty good, he made some good jokes, he was a bit over the top at times, but he was like our mascot.
He talked to everyone, often went back to explain something, he was almost always there, he did sports with us, he didn't steal snacks or phones, he came dressed properly.
He went to nature schools, did various monkey business, but he was fine, never any trouble.
In the eighth or ninth grade, siblings, gypsies entered the same grade, different classes.
Shortly afterwards, they beat up the teacher, the police were often there, they threatened and endangered other students...
I personally sell things on the classifieds (old things, things I don't need, etc.) and I've sold to Gypsies many times, they always had the money, they didn't try to get me to lower the price, and the communication was calm.
I even sold a car like this to a guy who called me a month later to say that he had already transferred it to his name.
I say about myself that I am not a racist, I don't care if someone is white, black, yellow, blue or other, as long as they behave as they should in a decent society (works, functions, doesn't beat women, just normal behaviour).
But when someone comes, stretches out their hand, empties apartments and houses, has only a mess around them, causes problems... it doesn't matter what colour they are, but it will bother me.
I have no problem with African migrants if they get involved here, start a business, work, learn the language (not necessarily, at least English), and respect our culture.
If they believe in Allah, I don't care, as long as they respect my traditions and culture, I will respect theirs.
A young woman died in a car accident in Prachatice
"The young woman suffered serious multiple injuries and despite resuscitation efforts, unfortunately, she succumbed to her injuries at the scene," said Zuzana Fajtlová, spokesperson for the South Bohemian emergency services, to Právo.
The accident was probably caused by the driver who was taking the girl.
The 18-year-old driver of the Peugeot was probably travelling from the village of Žíchovec to the village of Bavorov and, for unknown reasons, veered into oncoming traffic in a bend.
After the collision with the Škoda Octavia, the Peugeot ended up on its roof off the road, described the accident the South Bohemian police spokeswoman Štěpánka Schwarzová.
The young Peugeot driver suffered very serious injuries in the accident.
He suffered multiple injuries and was trapped in the vehicle.
After being rescued, he had to be given emergency pre-hospital care and was airlifted to the České Budějovice hospital in a stable condition, stated paramedic Fajtlová.
She added that the man in the other car suffered minor chest injuries and was taken to hospital.
New rules apply to parcels from outside the EU, customers often do not provide information about them
Lukáš Neuheisl orders from abroad several times a month.
He mainly collects collector cards.
"It is usually tens of dollars, say from ten dollars upwards, where it is still worth importing, especially from Japan, where the post is often free," the collector explains.
Since October, ordering small parcels has become slightly more expensive for him, he now has to add VAT and pass on information to the post office for customs procedures.
He will receive an e-mail informing him that customs are awaiting the arrival of the package.
Then you just need to fill in the details of the shipment, and if the seller did not include VAT in the sale, the customs office will assess it from the total amount for the shipment and for delivery.
If the recipient does not arrange the customs procedure themselves, the carrier's fee must also be added to the total amount.
According to Lukáš Neuheisel, however, the whole process is not complicated.
I tick one or two check boxes, attach two documents and I'm done.
For me, it's usually a matter of five minutes, says Neuheisl.
Not all deliveries go smoothly, however.
Due to new customs regulations, the daily number of parcels received from abroad at the international post office in Prague has fallen from 60,000 to 15,000.
According to Czech Post, another problem is that people do not respond to requests for information needed to complete customs procedures.
Currently, there are 30,000 parcels at the international post office that we need to process.
If people filled in all the information that is required and filled it in on time, we would be about halfway there, says Czech Post spokesperson Matyáš Vitík.
The solution to inflation
See the title, how would you suggest solving the current inflation?
Currently, we are at 9.9% inflation and it is expected to rise further.
What do you think should be done to slow down or compensate for this growth?
We see, for example, in Poland a reduction in VAT on food and PHM, is this the way for you?
What do you think is going to happen, what is inevitable with where it's going?
Prices are rising faster than wages, and it is inevitable that people will not be able to afford ordinary things, especially energy.
How much did you get, for example, added (if you are an employee)?
This year they added 2% to my gross, which is a joke, but fortunately I have a similar income from the business I run alongside my employment.
Would someone be able to explain to me why convicted violent offenders are sent to prison for only 6 months?
I just can't get my head around how a court can send such a beast to prison for just 6 months only for them to do it again as soon as they get out.
6 months is nothing compared to the fact that his/her victim will have trauma for years, negatively affect her/his sexual relationships and relationships in general.
Not to mention the fact that a rape victim may never recover from it.
Will this deter potential future rape victims from reporting?
The man from Hrob "shot" his girlfriend from Kostomlat
The man from Hrob inadvertently helped the officers to secure his nationwide wanted girlfriend from Kostomlaty, for whom an arrest warrant had been issued.
He himself called her.
He went about it in a roundabout way.
He first approached a passerby and made up a story that he had been robbed.
Officers were called to the scene and were left stunned when the alleged "victim" told them he had made the whole thing up in order to get the officers to come to the scene.
In fact, he just wanted to ask the police officers how to file a report with the Czech Police.
During the identity check of the man and his girlfriend, the officers found out that the woman is on the list of wanted persons, in a nationwide search, and an arrest warrant has been issued for her.
The case is therefore being dealt with by the Czech Police.
A sincere question for people here: do you consider our country to be Slavic?
I personally believe that the Slavs are no longer ethnically or culturally, but I would be interested in your opinion.
Otherwise, I agree with the meme, it's a pity that Churchill didn't manage to secure the liberation of Prague by the USA :')
Of course, I do not deny that we have a Slavic language.
I don't know, it's quite a question whether a rational person can really believe in something without evidence just because it could potentially do good.
I personally would not consider such a case to be true faith.
I cannot agree with Pascal here, there are, if I am not mistaken, an estimated ten thousand different religions in the world.
Which god or gods should one then choose?
I would say it is quite likely that in one of those thousands of religions there is at least one god who will punish you unpleasantly if you believe in another god.
However, the Ten Commandments state that there is no other god but Yahweh.
In such a case, wouldn't it be more rational to refrain from believing in any god, rather than risk choosing the wrong one out of the thousands of gods and the one true god that I just happened to miss sending me to hell or some similar place?
Others: Voluntary training with subsequent inclusion in the reserves.
The Swiss model is apparently similar.
X months of training (in different specializations, X months for each) and under the command of professionals with practical experience.
If you do well, you can get a professional offer.
Such a thing would be useful for all components of the Czech Armed Forces.
It could be done in cooperation with the University of Defence.
We can talk about it like this: The cooperation between the education sector and industry is constantly being repeated, companies are hunting in schools, and there is some kind of interweaving, when the workforce migrates from educational institutions to employment relationships.
Not only during adolescence, but this process is constantly going on, each of us is constantly learning something new, moving from one field to another, etc.
A similar overlap should work between the civilian and military sectors.
I see it as a way to build a kind of relationship between the citizen and the army, i.e. an institution that guarantees that Russia, Germany or even a Mongolian invader will never invade here again.
I find it funny how you consider NATO to be something set in stone, we have allies and they will defend us if something goes wrong.
No, don't make the man happy.
It only takes one election in the USA to cut their budget and the whole of NATO goes down the drain.
The English will exchange us for Russian money, the Germans will exchange us for Russian gas and the Poles have already shown that all they need to do is turn their backs and take what they want.
The only thing that works as a long-term guarantor of independence is an army armed to the teeth and a population that can operate the military technology of the day.
Today, every teenager can pilot a remotely controlled vehicle, so why wouldn’t it be possible.
We don't need border fortifications, they are useless today, but a determined teenager behind a remote-controlled device will manage.
How to not get lost in a box tsunami
You unwrap the gifts under the Christmas tree and suddenly you are at home surrounded by boxes and packaging?
This "waste" is being reused by online shops that are short of packaging materials.
A map of stores that will take your used boxes has been created.
And not just at Christmas.
All packaging materials are designed to withstand repeated handling.
That is why it is a shame to treat them as disposable waste.
Anyone can bring cardboard boxes, plastic or paper fillers to the participating store (the map of the KAMsNIM.cz project contains almost 150 of them).
This will support small businesses, reduce the amount of waste produced and also avoid overflowing blue bins.
The shops themselves welcome the packaging, which is currently in short supply on the market, and the saved money, as the price of packaging cardboard has increased by 50% over the past period.
In the eyes of environmentally conscious customers, I am strengthening my brand.
One of these stores is TIERRA VERDE, a manufacturer of eco-cosmetics and eco-cosmetics.
The boxes and packing materials are brought to us in Popůvky near Brno by individuals who have accumulated them at home, but we are also contacted by companies with whom we have agreed regular collections of discarded cardboard.
We will use everything when packing parcels from our e-shop.
Together, individuals and companies are creating a more considerate world.
Our wish is to preserve the resources and beauty of nature for future generations, says Petra Lopušníková from Tierry.
The www.KAMsNIM.cz application, however, shows not only collection points for packaging material.
It serves as a search engine if you need to get rid of anything (where to take sorted household waste, where to hand in expired medicines, tyres, retired electronics, batteries, light sources, bulky waste, etc.).
All waste can thus end up in the right place, and reusable items can find their second home.
The project map already contains more than 100,000 such places.
"Gradually, it includes collection yards, re-use centres, textile containers, food banks, charity shops, SWAPs and other places that help to find a use for things that would otherwise unnecessarily become waste," adds Miroslav Kubásek, one of the authors of the application from the Ukliďme Česko association.
I think it's wrong that in today's day and age, technology is so simple and idiot-proof that children who use a computer or phone to play games on it don't learn basic computer skills.
Recently, there has been a problem (mainly in English articles) that university students do not understand the principle of computer components.
Because things like Google Photos or Apple's Photos app or really mobile phones in general just hide the underlying filesystem with folders and just throw everything onto one screen in the app.
They can use the technique from childhood, but most importantly, they should learn something.
Let's rewrite history, seriously
Emmanuel Macron unveiled the priorities of the French EU presidency - starting in January - over the weekend, and it was grand.
Macron spoke for over an hour, during which he unveiled the logo of the presidency, called for the protection of Europeans - at work, on the street - and mentioned so many actions that they cannot be completed in six months.
French politicians like it and so do the voters.
Macron's supporters, who straddle the right and left, agree on little, but they do agree on Europe.
And in France, there will be new elections for the head of state in April.
The election calendar also influenced the priorities.
The French leader, among other things, mentioned that historians should write "one history of Europe" and France is ready to create conditions for such work by historians.
A number of commentators were quick to criticise Macron for pro-European propaganda and rewriting history.
In fact, it is trying to prevent the rewriting of history.
The far-right candidate for French president, Éric Zemmour, is currently touring France with the argument that the Vichy regime, which collaborated with Hitler during World War II, was not so bad, and he is quite successful with it among the French.
Let's take Macron's idea of a single history textbook seriously and not look at what's happening in France.
Would it not be needed?
In European countries, students often learn history as a story of us versus them, and never as a story of the whole.
The Spaniards, the French, the Czechs are learning who defeated whom in which battle.
Without an enlightened cantor, however, they will not learn the broader context of the event.
The film of the year is Quo vadis, Aida?
The Czech "Mice" did not win.
The story, which returns to the Srebrenica massacre of 1995, also won awards for its director and best actress Jasna Duričić.
This year at the Karlovy Vary festival, it was at the top of the audience rankings.
In Berlin, the best actor award went to Anthony Hopkins for the film The Father.
I'm not very young, I'm not very healthy/fit and I'm not vaccinated.
It was like "having the flu/being snotty" I had diarrhea for a few days and didn't feel like smoking...
It was worse than the common flu.
I don't have diarrhea with the flu.
(Just my personal experience. I'm not saying that everyone is like this)

Those who stayed and those who left know too little about each other to make a go of it.
Trains start running according to the new timetable, some operators will change
From Sunday, trains will run according to a new timetable.
The biggest change is the replacement of transport providers on some routes, such as between Ústí nad Labem and Kolín, where instead of Czech Railways, RegioJet will start running.
For most lines, only the departure time will be changed, and in some cases, the route will be slightly changed.
There will also be dozens of new trains on the tracks.
The transport companies started selling tickets already in the autumn.
České dráhy plan to run an average of 6783 passenger services per day in the new timetable, of which an average of 478 will be long-distance trains.
Trains will travel approximately 118 million kilometres during the new timetable.
In addition to domestic connections, the new timetable will also include routes to Germany, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Austria and Switzerland.
The company will introduce dozens of new trains along with the new timetable.
The main novelty will be the InterJet trains, which will run on the Prague-Cheb line.
The transport company will send other new trains to northern Moravia or western Bohemia.
The transport company will also traditionally increase the price of tickets next year, by an average of 3.2 percent.
The railways take inflation into account in their tariffs every year.
The biggest change in the RegioJet timetable is the entry into service on the R23 line Ústí nad Labem – Mělník – Nymburk – Kolín.
The transport company will replace České dráhy here after winning the Ministry of Transport's competition.
RegioJet will operate a total of 16 trains on the route every day, eight in each direction.
Other changes concern long-distance connections between Prague and Brno, which will also stop at Havlíčkův Brod, Žďár nad Sázavou and Kolín from Sunday.
Leo Express retained its 16 connections, two return connections to Slovakia and also weekend connections to Krakow.
According to spokesperson Emil Sedlařík, the transport company also tried to keep the timetables of its long-distance trains as similar as possible despite the planned works.
The operation of Arriva trains and other carriers should continue without major changes.
The transport operator will also change on some regional lines.
Changes are expected for passengers in the Českolipsko region, where instead of Czech Railways, trains from the German company Die Länderbahn will run on the line from Mladá Boleslav via Česká Lípa to Rumburk.
Passengers will also be able to use a unified ticket on the railways in the second year.
Like Czech Railways, their price will increase by the inflation rate of 3.2 percent.
I have to disagree.
Don't we learn to see the other side's point of view?
Everywhere we hear how much they had to fight for their rights, how they were oppressed and had to work hard and die.
In my life, I have never heard a teaching from the perspective of the slave-owning side or from that time. No one is defending this, only condemning it.
No one tells you in school that black people often sold other black people into slavery and that they were often the worst slave owners.
No one will teach you at school that the colonisers often bought the land from the Indians, all they will tell you is how brutally we, the Europeans, exterminated them, when in fact they had been killing each other for a long time.
I also spent some time in the USA, directly at schools, both in the north and in the south.
I have not come across anyone deliberately covering up facts, but I have heard before that it happens and I think it is a problem, I do not deny it (for example, in Japan, the atrocities of WW2 are quite taboo).
My point was more that history is not black and white and that we have a tendency to look at it from today's perspective without understanding.
History doesn't care about people's feelings, it just is what it is and I think it's a fatal mistake to condemn it without looking at it in the context of the time.
On the other hand, we should learn from it and never repeat it.
By the way, while we're on the subject of the southern states, yes, the Confederate flag and famous slave owners are quite popular there, on the other hand, they also had some good achievements and it seemed absurd to me to reject them.
Moreover, the North was not much better, as many people idealise it today.
And a lot of people forget that not everyone in the South was a slave owner and a lot of things were repugnant to them.
I wouldn't compare this with the Russians, they intentionally omit some facts, lie and manipulate, moreover, our point of view doesn't exist there (there was a video on YouTube from a television station where they cut off someone who started talking about our legionnaires and 1968).
What I found ridiculous about US schools was the rise of Marxism and the idealization of communism, something their country has never experienced.
Overall, I found that at some universities it was terrible, those students were quite radicalised and the schools often supported them in that.
And when I think of these people being much older one day, it makes me a bit sick that this could be the voice of the majority, because it is among the young and even in the ruling elite.
I feel like feminism has already achieved what it was supposed to and it's no longer about the same thing, it's become radicalized.
Currently, those who have nothing to do with it and ignore the basic biological facts are calling themselves feminists, as well as other groups such as LGBT, and this leads to radicalization on the opposite side, where it often leads to resistance even to quite reasonable things.
Moreover, the more radical someone is, the more likely they are to be heard.
On the other hand, at the end of the day, I haven't met anyone who would condemn me for colonialism or slavery.
I rather met with bad geography, but that was mutual :D
Not because I don't like it here, but because I think it's completely pointless.
Am I supposed to be proud of something I couldn't do on my own?
Moreover, I consider the concept of nationality to be unnecessary in terms of personal identity.
If there is anything that connects me with people, it is interests, views of the world and shared experiences, not the place where we were born.
I am not a believer, but from what I know, I can tell you this: We have two Greek Catholic parishes here, one is Ukrainian and the other is Slovak.
That Slovak priest is a really nice guy, his sermons are more about theology than politics, but then he always brings up some nonsense about the coronavirus, saying that everyone should be ashamed.
Then there is, of course, the Czechoslovak Hussite Church.
Officially they are Protestants, but in fact they were born out of Catholic modernism and are in fact Catholics without a pope.
I know a lot of people who are Catholic, but they go to services at the Hussites, because it is theologically very similar, but the members are usually more liberal.
They have a beautiful and historically very valuable functionalist church on Botanická Street.
Otherwise, the Church of St. Michael on the Dominican Square is under the jurisdiction of the Dominicans and they even hold a mass in Latin there every Sunday at 3:00 p.m., as it was done before Vatican II.
The Bethlehem flame is in the Czech Republic, the scouts took it from Austria
Břeclav - The flame lit in Bethlehem, where according to Christian tradition Jesus Christ was born, is in the Czech Republic.
The scouts did not go to Vienna for him this time either due to the coronavirus pandemic. They took him from their Austrian colleagues in the morning at the Reintal - Břeclav border crossing.
They took it over at the border last year.
The Bethlehem Light is a beautiful Christmas tradition that we participate in every year with our group, and I look forward to it very much.
It is an honour for me to have been chosen, said scout Amálie Budíková to the journalists present.
While last year the handover took place at the Mikulov-Drasenhofen border crossing, directly on the border bridge, this year it took place at the Reintal-Břeclav border crossing in the car park.
However, the scouts usually travel by train to Vienna.
The distribution of the flame across the Czech Republic will not change.
The scouts traditionally set off with the Bethlehem light by train first to Brno, where they will hand it over to the diocesan bishop Vojtěch Cikrle.
On Saturday, 18 December, scout couriers will take care of the subsequent distribution of the light. They will travel by selected express trains and passenger trains.
From them, the light will be taken over by local scouts or volunteers at the stations, who will then continue to spread the flame throughout the Czech Republic, even to places where the tracks do not lead.
This year, too, the scouts must comply with the current measures to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.
It is going the same way as last year.
We recommend that both the delivery teams and the organisers of local events should of course wear masks, try to keep their distance, have as few people as possible, not sing to each other, in short, to behave in a way that is as safe as possible, described the spokesperson for the Bethlehem Light event, Zuzana Hrbková.
The tradition of the Bethlehem light, which travels through Europe, was born in 1986 in Austria.
The aim is to spread the idea of peace, friendship and peace along with the flame.
The Bethlehem light is a symbol of hope for believers, a light that overcomes the darkness.
In the Czech Republic, the scouts and guides have been taking care of its spread for more than 30 years.
The event is run by hundreds of volunteers, and the flame is also a symbol of selflessness and human solidarity.
All the latest news, including a list of places where people can come to get a flame, can be found on the website www.betlemskesvetlo.cz.
I do not have an economic education, so I do not know the basics of economics that confirm that subsidies are a cancer of the economy, but I do not think that subsidies as a whole would be a problem.
The development of infrastructure, ecology (e.g. water retention), healthcare and education will make proper use of the money, but I don't understand why the money is being given to agriculture, industry and companies in general.
As mentioned, it produces unnecessary products and disrupts the free market and the "natural life of a company".
I work in a factory where there are a million signs in the corridors saying "xy funded/co-funded by project xy" and such a company is just artificially kept alive.
This is not support for a company that provides jobs for x people, this is holding back development when this company is just holding on and taking contracts/employees from companies that could expand and be more productive after its demise.
I totally agree, it's awful.
Even a person who was born in the internet era can fall for a trick or a trap - especially advertising.
I think that online advertising doesn't sway me, but then I catch myself being influenced by them anyway - it's just so sophisticated that you can't avoid it.
For this reason, I support the radical voices in the European Parliament who currently want to ban programmatic (= targeted) advertising altogether...
It's all rubbish, in the words of a classic - I would ban the internet.
I have a feeling that this virus has its roots in (but mainly in point 1):

2. "I won't believe everything the media says"
3. "I don't trust politicians"
TV has fallen out of love with Christmas films, with 200 premiering this year
Los Angeles - Cinemas, television channels and streaming platforms in the United States and other English-speaking countries have given in to the trend of Christmas films and this year will present a record number of more than two hundred premieres to their viewers.
The operator of the film database IMDb counted them.
The genre of Christmas family and romantic films has been scoring with the audience in recent years and has significantly increased viewership, so more and more of these films are being made.
This year, four times as many Christmas movies were made as in 2011 and twice as many as five years ago.
The IMDb database only includes those films that have the word Christmas in their title, so there are actually many more Christmas films.
The movies that people traditionally associate with Christmas have always been there.
In the Czech Republic, this period is associated with fairy tales, and worldwide, films such as Home Alone, Love Actually or the classic Christmas story It's a Wonderful Life from 1946 are popular.
The real boom in Christmas films, however, started in 2009, when the American cable television channel Hallmark came up with a special film series, recalled the BBC website.
Her Christmas project called Countdown to Christmas then included four films and was very successful.
This year, the station began to tune its viewers into Christmas on October 22 and will present a total of 42 Christmas films.
Competitor network Lifetime has 35 new Christmas-themed movies on its schedule this year, and popular streaming services like Netflix are also contributing to the total.
"In this magical time of year, the story doesn't matter so much, what's important is that there are a lot of Christmas trees in the background and that it's snowing," Brandon Gray, the author of a book on Christmas movies called I'll Be Home for Christmas Movies, said with a smile.
"For the audience, it's a form of escape and a way to feel a little bit of peace for at least two hours in the midst of all the holiday madness and the craziness of the world we've been living in for the last few years," Gray added.
He says that the Hallmark channel, for example, uses the same recipe for its films, which is uniform but successful.
You have two people who fall in love, but then there is a misunderstanding about half an hour before the end, which is successfully resolved and the two kiss.
It's the same thing over and over again, and as long as all the films look the same and have the same atmosphere, people watch one after the other, adds Gray.

Only nineteen drivers will take part in the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix in Formula 1.
Nikita Mazepin tested positive for COVID-19 and will not take part in the final race of the season.
The Haas team will only send one car onto the track.
In the last race of the season, he was aiming for a better position than the 20th place he qualified for.
However, Russian Nikita Mazepin from the Haas team will not take part in the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.
He was tested positive for COVID-19.
Only nineteen cars will appear on the starting grid, with Mick Schumacher, Mazepin's teammate, starting from the last place, and Max Verstappen starting from the first place, who will compete directly for the title with Lewis Hamilton.
According to Haas, Mazepin is doing well and shows no symptoms.
Nikita is physically well because he was asymptomatic.
She is now in isolation and will follow the guidance of the relevant public health authorities, with safety being the ultimate priority for all involved," her representatives told formula1.com.
Haas will not send a reserve driver to the race, nor can they.
A substitute would have to qualify or race in another part of the weekend.
The first racer is not dealing with Covid-19.
At the start of the season, Kimi Räikkönen had COVID-19, last year Sergio Pérez and Lewis Hamilton tested positive.

Gold, silver and 150 diamonds: The price tag of the most expensive sweater will amaze you!
It is a bit like a portable jewelry store, and the creator put half a year of work and all his savings into it.
"I had a vision of what I wanted to create, but I had little experience. Sweaters were never really worn at home," admits Liban, who spent 3,000 hours on his work over the course of six months.
The silk was bought in Italy, the 24-carat gold thread in France and the 2000 decorative crystals were provided by Swarovski.
The silver stars were then adorned with 150 diamonds.
"The base is wool and cotton, but the silk adds a softness to the sweater," the creator praises his work, which he does not recommend washing.
And it has another catch.
"I'm completely broke, I have to sell the sweater as soon as possible," admits Liban.
If successful, it will set a world record.
The previous most expensive sweater, sold five years ago, cost "only" 720,000 Czech crowns.

The government has approved the deployment of up to 150 soldiers to help Poland.
The surveyors, scouts and drone pilots could be deployed as early as Christmas, with the mission approved for six months.
They are to help their Polish colleagues with protecting the border with Belarus and with building the planned fence.
Poland has officially requested assistance from NATO states in connection with the months-long actions of the Belarusian regime, which invites citizens of Middle Eastern countries to its territory with a false promise of easy crossing of the EU border.
British and Estonian soldiers are already operating on Polish territory.
Is the Omicron mutation spreading in South Moravia?
Hygiene is investigating another case of a child from Adamov.
"We currently have another suspicion of this variant in another child from Adamov, from the preparatory class.
Direct contact with previous cases from ZŠ Adamov has not been proven," said Ciupek.
Six cases were reported in the region last week.
"We are still waiting for official confirmation of the variant in our six cases - it is being carried out by the National Reference Laboratory for Influenza and Non-influenza Viruses of the State Institute for Public Health in Prague," said the director.
She added that it was two nurses from one department of the Brno University Hospital and two children of one of them, and two eleven-year-old pupils of the Adamov elementary school.
There is no connection between the cases from Brno and Adamov.
According to the director, three of them have mild symptoms, four of them are asymptomatic.
No one with suspicion of Omicron has traveled abroad
None of them had travelled abroad, nor had anyone in their families, nor had they come into contact with anyone who had been abroad.
None of the people mentioned have any connection to the water polo championship, said Ciupek.
Chief hygienist Pavla Svrčinová previously stated that an international water polo tournament that took place in Brno a few weeks ago is being investigated.

California will limit gun sales.
It wants to follow Texas in banning abortions.
California Gov. Gavin Newsom announced Saturday a plan to ban the sale and manufacture of some guns in the nation's most populous state through a legal mechanism used by Texas in its controversial abortion law that bans the procedure once a fetal heartbeat is detected.
People would then be entitled to compensation in a lawsuit against anyone who makes or sells assault weapons or homemade guns in California.
Newsom's announcement came in response to a Friday ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court that allowed a Texas ban on abortions to remain in place, despite being at odds with a nearly 50-year-old precedent that established a nationwide right to abortion up to about 24 weeks of pregnancy.
The court did not, however, decide on the constitutionality of the entire law, but on a technical question that arises from the innovative construction of the measure.
In this case, enforcement of the ban was turned over to the public, making it impossible for Texas Republicans to challenge it in court.
"I am outraged by today's (Friday's) decision by the U.S. Supreme Court to allow the Texas ban on most abortions to remain in place and to largely uphold Texas's scheme to enforce its law," the California governor said.
"If states can now block federal courts from reviewing their laws, then California will use that authority to protect human lives," Newsom continued.
He reportedly tasked his subordinates to work with the state parliament and the justice minister on a measure that would allow public representatives to enforce a ban on assault rifles and so-called ghost guns.
The term is used to describe homemade weapons that do not have serial numbers and can be used to circumvent regulations.
Newsom wants to give "private citizens" the right to seek at least $10,000 (220,000 CZK) in damages and legal fees from anyone who manufactures, distributes or sells assault weapons, "ghost gun" parts or kits to make them in California.
"If the most effective way to keep these deadly weapons off our streets is to create a threat of private lawsuits, then that is exactly what we should do," the California governor said.
The AP notes that California has banned the manufacture and sale of some military-style weapons for decades, but a federal judge blocked the state's ban as unconstitutional in June.
If the state were to now actually reinstate the ban using the Texas template, it would confirm the words of liberal Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who in a dissenting opinion to Friday's majority verdict warned of the expansion of the legal mechanism to other American states.
The Supreme Court, however, did not grant the Texas abortion ban complete immunity from judicial review, allowing abortion clinics to continue to sue select officials in the southern U.S. state.
Each emergency vaccination has its public testing phase, where it is gradually determined what the vaccination scheme will look like, and the vaccines themselves are also improved based on the results.
For example, studies on the effects of the 4th dose are already rolling in from Israel.
And according to these studies, in most patients there is a fivefold increase in antibodies, which already has the long-term effect you mentioned.
Just like any other vaccine, it will have its own vaccination schedule in time, but it's too early for that now.
Another fact is that a new vaccine based on an inactivated virus is expected to hit the market soon, which, according to the manufacturer's specifications, promises up to 10 times greater effectiveness.

Poland threatens to block EU budget payments
According to Ziobro, the European Commission would be acting in breach of the law if it used its new powers and stopped payments to Poland due to the dispute over the rule of law.
The Commission has already delayed approval of the Polish plan for spending 36 billion euros from the EU fund for the recovery of economies hit by the COVID-19 pandemic.
And it is under pressure from the European Parliament to move forward and use a mechanism to withhold EU funds from countries that violate the rule of law.
"Poland should respond to this blackmail from the EU with a veto in all matters that require unanimity," said Ziobro, head of the small Solidarna Polska party, without whose votes the current government would lose its narrow majority in the Sejm.
"Poland should also consider its commitments in the EU's energy and climate policy, which lead to a drastic increase in energy prices," added Ziobro.
If the dispute continues, I will demand that Poland stop its contributions to the EU.
It would be justified given the fact that the EU is illegally denying us funds from the common budget, which we also contribute to, added the Polish minister.
His party takes a more radical approach to the EU than the ruling Law and Justice party.
According to the European Commission, the changes that the Polish justice system has undergone during Ziobro's tenure threaten its independence and subordinate it to politicians.
According to Ziobro, Brussels is setting "impossible conditions, because its goal is not the rule of law, but a change of government in Poland".
Warsaw is facing "political blackmail and an attempt to undermine the democratic decision of several million Poles," Ziobro also said.
He said that Poland should be a member of such an EU, which is based on the partnership of sovereign states, and not on the rule of the strongest and the Brussels bureaucracy, which is not under democratic control.
He said his party would never agree to such concessions to Brussels that would limit Poland's sovereignty.
"We will never agree to Poland having the status of a colony," he said.
But to get to grips with it... We have one type of cheese in four different places in our Lidl.
I didn't look for anything else, I also met one yogurt more than once, I only needed cheese, parmesan, after ten minutes at the dairy shelves I gave up and asked.
They had it, that's true, in that narrow sector there were all the selected, less common and special cheeses, but it was between the vegetables and the lactose-free zone...
If I avoid it, I won't even go into any supermarket, sales or no sales, the golden shop on the square, they may not have such a wide selection there, but they usually have everything I need and it's all in some kind of order, so I'm done in ten minutes.
I went to Lidl to buy my holiday.
And I don't care anymore.
I've been watching for two years how data is handled here as if it were manure, and most of the anti-vaxxers are just a little bit more out of touch than most of the pro-vaxxers.

It's always from wall to wall.
Binary thinking: vaccination will save us, vaccination is useless.

Colourful charts instead of robust analysis.
Apples and oranges.
This state does it this way and we do it this way.
But the fact that the data collection methodology is different in those two states is not being discussed.
Phew, I feel relieved.
Sorry for the outburst and I wish you all a nice day.
I was punished with a wooden spoon as a child.
It was never about the grades, it was mostly that I repeatedly refused to listen and misbehaved (read instead of going to sleep, fought with my brother, etc.).
At the same time, I was never punished without a warning. My mother always threatened that if I did it again, I would get a slap (sometimes even after another "scolding" with the cooking spoon, she would only bring it and place it so that I could see it).
Only after I repeatedly refused to listen did I get a couple of spanks (through my clothes).
Personally, I think that physical punishment (in a reasonable manner and to a reasonable extent) is beneficial, because the child responds to it much more than to words.
I think the part with the warning is important, because it gives the child a way to choose whether to disobey and get the punishment, or to improve and not get the punishment.
I was usually just warned to start listening.
Defense of the system
When the prominent Czech lawyer and constitutional judge Vojtěch Cepl answered a journalist's question in 1999 about what the Czech constitution means to him - whether it is a sacred document that is sworn upon and taught about in school from an early age, or, on the contrary, an agreement that can be changed if necessary - he definitely leaned towards the first concept.
Once we agreed on the democratic rules of our life in the constitution, which also define who we are as a state and its citizens, and it is better to be sparing with changes.
And imagine: some nations even like their rules.
Just as Czechs like dumplings with pork and cabbage, Vojtěch Cepl commented on the question at that time.
However, in recent times, it has become more common for lawyers to express the opinion that the Czech Constitution needs to be changed.
Over the years, it has been tested by situations that its creators (including Vojtěch Cepl) could not have foreseen, such as the behaviour of the directly elected president.
But Cepl was right about one thing.
All we know about such documents shows that political interference in their texts must be well thought out.
The Institute must be understood and actively defended, only then can it be the key to dealing with most of the crises that societies have faced throughout history.
The constitution is, among other things, a kind of order of government consisting of individual rules that set the boundaries of the game for politicians.
We are afraid that power will be abused against minorities or individuals, so we tie the hands of politicians with bans.
At the same time, however, the constitutional texts also allow politicians to exercise their power.
Covid doesn't discriminate, several-month-old baby is fighting for its life in Brno University Hospital
Although it is known that the coronavirus is milder in children, there are also severe cases that hospitals have been dealing with mainly recently.
"We know that children are less at risk and less affected than adults, with 2 to 5 percent compared to adults," said Novinky head of the Clinic of Pediatric Anesthesia and Resuscitation of the University Hospital Brno and the Medical Faculty of Masaryk University Petr Dominik.
The course is usually much easier, lighter, and often without symptoms.
But there are child patients who are seriously ill with the coronavirus, which we have seen in particular in recent times," added Dominik.
According to the doctor, there are dozens of children who need mild supportive care.
It is set in a children's infectious diseases clinic.
Children who are very seriously ill with coronavirus have only recently been admitted to the ICU.
Children with post-COVID syndromes have been on the ward continuously throughout the year, according to the doctor.
"Now we're seeing an increase in children with acute COVID pneumonia, meaning inflammation of the lungs that requires a stay in the intensive care unit," he said, adding that the disease affects not only adults but also adolescents and even several-month-old babies.
Children are also being admitted to hospital with severe cases of coronavirus.
"Currently, we have a child of several months and an adolescent in our care," said the head physician.
She is happy, however, that the children's hospital at University Hospital Brno has not yet recorded any child deaths from the coronavirus.
According to available data, six children aged 0 to 14 died in the Czech Republic on 6 December.
According to Dominik, a psychologist is an integral part of the team in a children's hospital - not just on the coronavirus ward.
It also points out that, just like in adults, vaccination also reduces the severity of the disease and at the same time reduces the occurrence of post-COVID syndrome in children.
"That is why we recommend the booster dose for children as well," added the doctor.
In the rest area, you can only walk on marked paths.
But the quiet zones are not that big.
They are visible on the tourist map on mapy.cz.
Generally in national parks outside of the quiet zone you can walk anywhere (but don't climb over the fence into the game reserve).
Skiing/cycling in the forest off-piste is not allowed anywhere unless you have an exemption (but of course, it's not really enforced outside of national parks).
How does a conductor exercise?

As a singer, he can sing practically any repertoire, and as a conductor, he works not only at the F. Šaldy Theatre in Liberec, but also in Pilsen, at the Josef Kajetán Tyl Theatre.
He works with the Hradec Philharmonic, the Film Philharmonic or the Podkrkonoší Symphony Orchestra.
China is building the impression that it has controlled the outbreak and that the authoritarian regime is better at dealing with the crisis
Sinologist Jirouš: China is building the impression that it has managed the epidemic and that the authoritarian regime is better at dealing with the crisis.
China has launched a health and political offensive.
A few months ago, Beijing was deflecting criticism for failing to contain an outbreak that turned into a global pandemic.
Now, the country is reporting zero new infections.
Countries including the Czech Republic are competing for Chinese protective equipment and Chinese doctors are helping in the fight against the coronavirus in many places, including the worst-hit Italy.
How should we view Beijing's willingness?
Is it friendly support or is the communist regime trying to improve its image in the world?
A friend meets a friend and says to him: hey, do you want an elephant?
I have it and it's great.
The wife is happy because it mows the lawn, washes the car, and the children play with it.
No, it's just great.
If you want, I'll sell you an elephant for 5000.
Friend: Sure, I'll do it, it'll be great...
After some time, they meet and the one who bought it complains: you bastards, what did you sell me the elephant for????
The lawn is trampled, there are huge piles of manure everywhere, the car is broken, the children are afraid of it, and my wife wants to get a divorce.
The one who sold it says: You speak badly about the elephant, you won't sell the elephant like that...
World events are controlled by the great powers.
Although all sovereign states are equal, it is the great powers that determine the course of international affairs.
Europe can only become a great power if it works on its integration.
It currently works at the economic and political level (on selected issues), but military integration is still missing.
I personally think that Europe is heading towards federalisation.
It won't be in 10, 15 or 20 years.
But in the middle of the century, the mood will be different and it will work.
I also thought of it and it is quite possible.
I'm not an expert in Czech, so I may be pedantic.
I'm just going off the fact that an ellipse usually includes 2 different units at the same level.
I will borrow an example from another comment "Spanish oranges and mandarins", where it is clear that both are from Spain, whereas in "Spanish fruit and mandarins" it is not clear that the mandarins are from Spain.
In addition, I base this on the fact that the sentence reads "all American forces," including their weapons, and I know that American complexes are operated only by Americans.
In other words, I expect that it is already included in the broad term and there is no need to specify it for American forces.
But again, I'm just being pedantic :D
Whatever the case, it's an absurd request

British woman Vicki Holland tortured Milly the capuchin monkey
The terrifying footage shows the moment the terrified monkey cowered in a toilet bowl before its heartless owner flushed it and laughed at it.
Holland also fed the monkey hot dogs, kebabs and hamburgers, regardless of its actual nutritional needs.
Gwent Magistrates' Court has now banned her from keeping animals for life, The Sun reported.
The monkey rehabilitation experts who care for Milly after her abuse have said they have never seen a cosmonaut so terrified.
Milly spent almost two years in rehabilitation with staff at Monkey World in Dorset and is now happily playing with another rescued monkey called Moon.
The mother-of-four admitted two charges of causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal.
She was given a 12-week prison sentence suspended for one year at Gwent Magistrates' Court.
Hollandová was also sentenced to 120 hours of unpaid work, received a lifetime ban on breeding animals and must pay 12,000 Czech crowns in court costs.
The head of the Small Monkeys team that rehabilitated the abused animal, Steph Sawyer, said: "Milly is doing well but the rehabilitation will continue."
It took Milly a while to get used to people again.
She cowered and hid from everyone she met and any loud sound or sudden movement made her scream.
The monkey refused to eat for a long time.
Even now, when she has settled down and is happy with her mate, the sight of new people can still send her into a panic.
The psychological scars of the abuse will stay with her forever, says Sawyer.
The abuse of Milly came to light after Gwent Police discovered the harrowing footage on the woman's phone following a drugs raid at her home.
The footage shows Milly swearing in a vulgar manner.
In another video, Holland can be heard offering the monkey cocaine and saying: "Do you want some cocaine?"
So lick my fingers.
In May, she and her partner Russell Cox (43) admitted to possession of cocaine with intent to supply.
Cocaine worth £1,600 (about 50,000 Czech crowns) was found in her home, hidden in Kinder eggs.
Cox was then jailed for 30 months and Holland received a suspended sentence of 20 months.

Go out on the street and ask random people if they can determine the nature of the roots of a quadratic equation and the coefficients.
Everyone goes through it, and the vast majority won't even scratch their heads and tell you that they don't care.
So what the fuck are they learning?
I'm a big fan of general knowledge and the fact is that people don't want it and don't need it.
And at that point it's pointless and you'll never get it through to them anyway.
Part of it is learning for all the people who are going to need that thing.
But as for the remark that you don't need all this when you're standing by the machine, I meant it quite seriously... ...because you don't need it.
Plus, we're slowly getting to the time when not knowing is a mark of punk.
(Which is probably due to our communist past and our dislike of intellectuals and elites) However, the price of having barbarians man those machines is simply too high.
If only the journalists could count, the coronavirus would probably never have reached these dimensions here.
Wedding at first sight: The war between Kadri and Andrea continues!
Which is the main reason why Switzerland cannot leave right away," Andrea replied on Instagram in Stories to the all-encompassing questions of curious fans about what disappointed her so much about Kadri that she decided to end all contact and even block him on social media.
From the beginning of the experiment, Kadri and Andrea have been at each other's throats.
The main problem was that Kadri lived and worked in Switzerland and his idea was that Andrea would move there, at least until he returned to the Czech Republic for good.
However, she resolutely rejected this.
And as it turns out, their relationship didn't end in love, but rather in mutual disrespect and even hatred.
It was your planned attack! Kadri retorted in response to Andrea's accusations of lies, gambling and debts.
Kadri's alleged honesty now doesn't sit well with his ex-wife or his younger sister Linda.
She decided to publicly defend her brother.
Normally, I don't talk about these things at all, and we never really talked about these things in the family.
I certainly don't want to evoke any pity.
But when I see someone trying to publicly hurt and tarnish the name of someone I love so much, I just can't help it!
I'm sorry that I have to do this in this way, but I would like to publicly thank my brother Kadri for being a character and helping our family when we needed it the most, even though he was so young.
I am even more saddened when I have to read such false information, which is probably taken out of context.
I would wish for everyone to know Kadri as I do, as do our close friends and family, in response to Andrey's words.
I am really grateful to him for everything!
Of course people will believe what is written, but the most important thing is that we, his family, love him above all and we know the truth and we know how it really was, she added uncertainly.
The drunk thief climbed up the facade to the fifth floor.
You won't believe why.
Chao began his crime spree in a residential area parking lot, where he tried to break into several cars.
According to available information, he eventually stole less than 330 crowns from one vehicle.
He then had no better idea than to climb up to the 5th floor and enter the apartment through an open window.
There he stole two bananas.
He is then caught on a security camera walking down the street away from the scene of the crime while eating a banana.
When the apartment owner woke up in the morning, he found the bananas were not where they were and called the police.
She then detained Cchaa.
The man admitted that he had drunk some alcohol on the day in question.
And since he needed money, he decided to rob when he was drunk.
The whole thing is currently under investigation.
The drunk climbed up the facade to the 5th floor, where he stole two bananas.
The pandemic law is time-limited and its effectiveness is tied to the state of pandemic preparedness.
When that is repealed, the law will not be in effect.
The law does limit the scope of business
Is that not enough of a reason for you?
The right to assemble will be restricted, but not abolished.
Over 60 percent of voters turned out for Saturday's elections to the councils of four municipalities
New councils were elected on Saturday in the towns of Komňa in the Uherské Hradiště district, Lužice in the Most district, Nová Ves in the Liberec district, and in Rovné in the Pelhřimov district.
The number of councillors in these municipalities has fallen below the number set by law or the elected councils have collapsed.
On Saturday, 99 candidates were running for the total of 28 seats.
The average age of the newly elected representatives is 46.7 years.
The oldest of them is 69 years old, the youngest is 33 years old.
The processing of the results of Saturday's elections symbolically closes a fairly demanding but successful year for us.
Four new or repeated elections to municipal councils and, above all, the very closely watched elections to the Chamber of Deputies were held there, stated the Vice-President of the Czech Statistical Office Eva Krumpová.
She recalled that the elections were more demanding in terms of equipment and personnel security due to the COVID-19 epidemic.
In Komňa near Uherské Hradiště, the Association of Independent Candidates won the Saturday elections, receiving 27.76 percent of the votes and two seats in the seven-member council.
The STAN candidate received 24.84 percent of the votes, which also means two mandates.
Občané pro Komňu also won two seats in the council, receiving 18.52 percent of the vote.
The current mayor of the village, Jana Křižková, who is a member of the Soukromníci, also made it back onto the council.
The Komňans - independent candidates - won one seat in the council.
75.48 percent of eligible voters went to the polls.
The association Pro Rovnou won in the village of Rovná in Pelhřimov.
It received 50.50 percent of the votes, which means four seats out of seven.
Two representatives from the Association of Independent Candidates 1 and one from the Association of Independent Candidates 2 were elected to the municipal council.
Voter turnout was 93.62 percent.
The Lužice and Svinčice Association, led by Mayor Jindřich John, won the repeated elections in Lužice in Most.
It received 56.73 percent of the vote and, just like in 2018, it has four seats in the seven-member council.
The second place went to the Local for People party, which received 43.27 percent of the vote. The party will have three representatives in the council.
76.7 percent of voters went to the polls.
Independent candidates Naděje pro Novou Ves won the elections in Nová Ves in the Liberec region, ahead of the ANO movement.
The association of independent candidates received 59.88 percent of the vote and won four seats in the seven-member municipal council.
ANO received 40.12 percent of the votes and strengthened against the regular elections in 2018, gained one more mandate and has three.
Voter turnout was 42.9 percent of voters.
The State Election Commission will discuss the election results on Monday.
They will then be published in the Collection of Laws.
What do you think would be the bigger problem?
A dead civilian or a foreign politician?
I think you know all this stuff that people are writing to you here.
You're just playing the fool to have someone to "argue" with.
If not, it's sad.
I am not saying that Christians are degenerates, or anything like that.
I even like a lot of church buildings from an aesthetic point of view (which, after all, was the point, to look good).
And I don't care who believes what.
On the other hand, I am bothered by how much power the church had in the Middle Ages, how much money it amassed, the suppression of science, etc.
Not to mention all the wars it has caused, e.g. the Thirty Years' War
Tl;dr: Believe in the spaghetti monster if you like, but the state and the church have nothing to do with each other
The man fell head first from twelve meters.
He survived the crash into the concrete.
An incredible fall was survived by a man in Ostrava on Sunday night, who was attended to by rescuers from the regional Medical Rescue Service.
The regional emergency centre received an emergency call an hour after midnight on Saturday with initial information about a man falling from a height.
Two emergency services crews - medical and paramedic - were immediately dispatched to the scene.
When paramedics arrived at the scene, they found that the 27-year-old man had fallen from a window from a height of about twelve meters and landed on his head on concrete!
In Vítkovice, the coal caught fire.
But not as it should have been, and the firefighters went into action.
On arrival of emergency services the man was unconscious, with multiple injuries and in a life-threatening condition.
The attending physician intubated his airways, ensured artificial lung ventilation, and after further measures as part of pre-hospital emergency care, the ambulance transported him to further care at the Ostrava trauma centre, informed the spokesperson for the Moravian-Silesian Region Emergency Medical Services, Lukáš Humpl.
I am more concerned about the inadequate reactions of the public and authorities than I am about the coronavirus
The spread of the coronavirus in the Czech Republic is a challenge for politicians and officials, but doctors and medical staff are at the forefront of the fight against the infection.
How serious is the situation from their perspective?

Legendary Nunes falls after seven years, Oliveira defends the belt
MMA experienced a great gala evening full of interesting results.
Things happened at UFC 269.
The outsider Julianna Peña managed to beat the legendary fighter Amanda Nunes, who had not been defeated for seven years.
Charles Oliveira did not hesitate in the lightweight division, showed a great choke against Dustin Poirier and defended the belt.
Also winning was Kai Kara-France, who quickly swept Cody Garbrandt with a technical knockout in the first round.
He also defeated his opponent, Sean O'Malley.
A surprise that no one expected.
This was brought about by the women's bantamweight bout between the famous Amanda Nunes and Julianna Peña.
The American entered the mutual battle as a kind of "dwarf," since Nunes had not lost for seven years and was sharpening her teeth for another triumph.
The start of the duel was also in line with the paper predictions.
Nunes started the fight very actively and even gave her opponent a push kick, which sent her to the ground.
However, Peňová did not allow herself to make any more mistakes and she herself unsuccessfully tried to attack with an armlock.
The second round was gripping and very tense for MMA fans.
Both rivals traded a series of excellent punches and hard hooks.
Peña then threw Nunes to the ground, where she began to choke her.
She had to give up the effort and fend off the attack.
The American woman thus prepared a huge shock for everyone when she became the new champion.
The main event of the evening was the battle between Charles Oliveira and Dustin Poirier for the lightweight title.
At first, Poirier was doing better, but the cards gradually started to turn.
In the second round, Oliveira tried to be more active, and he tried to lock his opponent's arm.
He didn't do very well at first, but then he built up a lot of pressure, got his opponent on his back and hit him with a series of blows.
This is why he won the second round.
In the third round, Oliveira showed a rear naked choke, which Poirier resisted for a while, but then had to tap out.
The Brazilian thus defended his title, while Poirier lost after two years.
In the next match, Sean O'Malley scored a decisive victory, landing a hard right cross on Raulian Paiva in the first round.
He then finished him off with a series of precise blows and recorded his 15th triumph.
Kara-France then beat Cody Garbrandt.
In the spring, Nunes celebrated another triumph with her little daughter, now after seven years she lost.
That hip, or that hip?
At first glance, it doesn't seem like anything complicated.
Most nouns in Czech express only one grammatical gender, so there is no problem in determining whether it is masculine, feminine or neuter.
There is also a fairly large group of nouns for which the gender is not fixed.
Such substantives oscillate between two genders.
When inflected, they take on dual endings, and in some cases remain in the uninflected form.
For example, the words "svízel" and "kyčel" are both masculine and feminine, in the first case they are declined according to the pattern "stroj", in the second case according to the pattern "píseň".
In another group of nouns, the forms are different even in the first singular case, for example: "řádek/řádka", "kedluben/kedlubna" or "brambor/brambora" (in the sense of food).
Both forms are standard, have the same meaning, and are therefore freely interchangeable.
Some words may vary regionally, for example "okurka" in Bohemia and "okurek" in Moravia, but in this case the Moravian variant is non-standard, as is the case with other Czech-Moravian pairs of words: "příkop" and "příkopa", "kobliha" and "koblih", etc.
Some words that have entered the Czech language from other languages were originally uninflected, but they are gradually taking on Czech endings.
A typical example is the word "image", which is both masculine and feminine, or the word "buffet", which has remained in the neuter gender without inflection, but in the masculine it has endings according to the pattern "hrad".
Turkey has opened the way for migrants to Europe.
What is the situation like on the Greek border?
There is tension on the Greek-Turkish border as the number of migrants trying to reach Europe grows.
Thousands of people began heading towards the southern edge of the Schengen area after Ankara stopped blocking them.
European politicians promise Greece support, and the Czech government is also preparing humanitarian aid.
What actually motivates refugees to take the uncertain journey?
And what is the situation like on the spot?
We haven't seen blue skies for three months and we've been choking, says a journalist from Sydney
The devastating fires that have been plaguing Australia for four months have killed nearly three dozen people and hundreds of millions of animals, and have destroyed millions of hectares of land.
How are the local authorities and the residents themselves dealing with the disaster?
Could the Prime Minister Morrison's government have done more to prevent the drastic impact, critics say?
And what will the country have to prepare for in terms of climate change in the future?
Lenka Kabrhelová speaks with journalist Ika Detrichová from Sydney.
False accusations are always and have always been rare.
That is why everyone is always written about everywhere.
It's uncomfortable for people to think about what sexual violence looks like in our society and how widespread it is, so they try to ignore it.
I don't know anyone personally who has been falsely accused.
I know a lot of people who have been raped and I have seen how the people around them and even the police often treat them.
Victims should always be believed.
It has become a trend for victims to finally open up about their traumas.
But too many people keep it to themselves.
Yes, there are those who make false accusations.
It's disgusting and spitting in the face of all sexual assault victims, but by spreading the idea that "a lot of the accusations are false" and that it's a "trend" you're only helping sexual predators.
Scattered houses flood the Czech Republic, families have no money to finish them
The price of building materials has risen by more than 30 per cent in recent weeks and months.
Many people have found themselves in a difficult situation because of this.
She does not have the means to complete the family homes she has started and the banks are refusing to increase her mortgage loans.
In addition to the cost of materials, the cost of construction work is also increasing.
People therefore do not have enough money to finish the family homes that have already been set up.
In many cases, banks are refusing to increase mortgage loans, creating extremely unpleasant situations.
At best, people move into scattered and uninspected homes.
In the worst case, the scattered houses are uninhabitable and families are forced to sell them because they cannot afford to pay off their mortgages and also pay rent," says BHS economist Štěpán Křeček.
We build two to three family homes a year and in fifty per cent of cases this has happened to us.
For us as a construction company, it is difficult in that we have to adhere to some things contractually, even though the materials have become more expensive.
So we do it for free," said the owner of a construction company, Zdeněk Slivoň.
A lot of people are yet to have financial problems.
If they were counting on the construction of the house costing five million, now it will cost them seven.
I think some will wait," added Slivoň.
The most expensive materials were copper, iron and also plumbing and heating equipment.
Construction firms are also struggling with a shortage of labour.
There is a shortage of graduates in construction-related fields in the Czech Republic, and the influx of foreign workers is being slowed by the pandemic.
The situation is more favourable at the moment only when it comes to issuing building permits.
"In October, the building authorities issued 7,675 building permits, which is almost 10 percent more than last year," Křeček clarified.
We are doing well and we will do even better.
A real vision is missing, says ČRO – mujRozhlas commentator
In addition to the traditional celebrations, the entry into the new year was also traditionally accompanied by speeches by politicians.
This year, in addition to the Prime Minister and the Chairman of ANO Andrej Babiš, and the Christmas message from President Miloš Zeman, the Chairman of the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies also addressed the nation.
What did we learn?
I think the master's thesis is great, I have my own topic that I chose, it builds on my bachelor's, I always work on it for a whole year and then I write the written part in a week or two.
The state exams are completely calm here. If you're not a total monkey and you've retained something in your head, the committee won't unnecessarily suffocate you with theory.
I studied for the state exams for a week, and when I was at my wit's end, the commission would always try to lead me to some logical deduction, which I would immediately understand, and I would get it right.
Otherwise, to those projects, I know people who pay someone to do their semester project for them (we did it a lot, it's really beneficial, you learn a lot) and then they just learn the project and they're done.
In my opinion, it is great when there is an exam at the end of the subject, which reflects the knowledge gained through the project, not just a defence.
All well and good, but don't flood the embassy with emails and phone calls and don't send any packages.
You'll be just like them.
Those people at the embassy may not have anything to do with it.
And if they were against Russia, they would be taking a big risk, so maybe they have to play with them, because otherwise something could happen to them.
But you can just as well put a similar statue of Putin next to the statue of Winnie the Pooh.
Even if it is to give it to Xi Jinping so that it reaches his backside or something like that.
I agree, even though Insta is throwing artists under the bus.
If you don't post stories every day and at least a new picture every other day, your reach will drop to absolute minimum.
In addition, it keeps changing what is more important, whether it is a like, a comment or a save.
I'm really annoyed at the moment, so I might have to go down to TikTok, where a lot of artists from my industry have success and don't give a damn about it.
I would even be happy if something more user-friendly came along that didn't suck all the creativity and energy out of the artists
A statement from the Donetsk Workers' Party
The Union - yes, the breakup - no, say the opponents of the breakup of the USSR in the picture.
Thirty years since the illegal break-up of the USSR.
On December 8, 1991, the largest geopolitical catastrophe in human history took place.
In the Belovezhskaya Pushcha forest on December 8, 1991, Boris Yeltsin, Leonid Kravchuk, and Stanislav Shushkevich, without any legal authority and in violation of the results of the referendum of March 17, 1991, with the open-minded attitude of Mikhail S. Gorbachev, secretly, without regard for the people, signed an agreement that "the USSR as a subject of international law and as a geopolitical reality ceases to exist."
With one stroke of a pen, they "abolished" a huge country with almost three hundred million inhabitants.
With the dissolution of the USSR, tens of millions of ethnically Russian citizens found themselves abroad.
Since the early 1990s, Russia's population has fallen by ten to eleven million.
Even without the loss of the non-Russian population of the former Soviet republics, we have already lost more people than in the two World Wars combined!
Even earlier, the same people who in one sitting in the Belovezhskaya Pushcha forest destroyed what had been built over the previous seventy years, betrayed the socialist camp (created at the cost of millions of lives in World War II and in the Great Patriotic War).
They deliberately de-industrialised, slowed down agriculture, and pulled away from the largest world power the fourteen republics that had previously been economically linked in a single mechanism.
If we look even deeper, we see the impoverishment of the population, the collapse of the economy, science, the military, the rise of crime, inter-ethnic conflicts, the war in Chechnya, all the conflicts in the post-Soviet space, a series of Orange Revolutions, the expansion of NATO to the east, the war and the disintegration of Yugoslavia, the Arab Spring, the war in Syria - all of this is the result of geopolitical capitulation, first of the socialist camp, and then of the Soviet Union.
There is a concept in political science called "power vacuum".
All that was hastily betrayed and surrendered was quickly filled and taken by the NATO countries that accepted our geopolitical capitulation.
And the whole world is still shaken by the events of the late 1980s and early 1990s.
The price of a product sold in a supermarket with a large turnover may not directly correspond with its quality and quality.
It's Monday and we have some meat in the supermarket that costs 189 CZK/kg.
I'll buy it and put it in the fridge and make it into dinner on Thursday.
In an alternative reality, where I don't buy the meat on Monday, the chain will reduce its price to 99 CZK/kg on Tuesday - describe to me the mechanism by which the change in its price makes the meat a burden for my digestive system?
Or I can wait until Thursday and the meat will be discounted to 69 CZK/kg one day before the expiry date - how would this meat differ from what I bought on Monday for 120 CZK more and left in my fridge for 3 days?
I'll answer myself - with nothing.
These talks about the fact that if something is cheap, it must be definitely bad, spoiled or of low quality are really retarded, to tell you the truth ;-)
Recently, I went to Hlavas in Brno and in the underpass, a lady was handing out some brochure, I always take things like that to help the volunteers, they can't throw it away...
No, the brochure was full of common sense and conservative views on how the world works, but there was nothing about God, I was confused, but I suspected it would be some kind of agitprop.
After reading it, I found out who published it and it turned out to be scientology.
No, it was a good matron, full of completely useless advice, like I should wash and not be a wimp.
It's a waste of paper, because the rainforests wouldn't have to be cut down for this.
I've experienced something similar with an ex-girlfriend.
Psychological manipulation and emotional blackmail will make you want to accommodate that person because you like them, without realizing how messed up the situation is.
She threatened me several times that she would hurt herself because I went out to chat with a friend she didn't like.
Or when I wanted to leave her apartment early, she would break down in tears and beg me on her knees not to leave.
She then began to physically block the door.
It was a great relationship for about a year, but then another six months passed and it started to beat her up.
I then ended the relationship by telling her that I was breaking up with her and asked her to wait until next week to talk about it so that I could calm her down and so that she wouldn't go crazy again.
Such a person will suck the city, emotions and overall joy out of you.
Prefer to keep their distance
When insurance companies are frantically buying up clouds of tests and hunting for positives who wouldn't even know about that terrible disease if it weren't for the test.
The only thing we achieve is complications for companies, carriers and others, because five days of house arrest fell to their employees in the random number generator.
In the west, they have stopped with this nonsense and recognised that it is not worth dealing with a disease weaker than the famous flu.
Unfortunately, Válek is new and has to steal something and boost his ego by inventing trouble.
I see that the old good gossip is coming back to us again.
After years of decline and suppression of this shady business, MLM recruiting is back in the limelight.
I was one of the recruits, I gave it a go (I was 20 years old, a first-year university student), the initial promises of product and business skills training quickly turned into "you don't need to worry about that, just get people on board".
I was genuinely interested in the products I was selling because I wanted to help people, but the training was more about how to scare and talk people into it.
When the first money came in, you quickly realized that if you wanted to make money, you had to sell a certain number of products a month.
Investment life insurance and mortgages were the only profitable, so you felt like a door-to-door pot salesman.
What I can say, however, is that it was a valuable experience, and I learned not to jump on every piece of gossip and to thoroughly verify information.
At the same time, I would not lump everyone together.
There are people in this business who are successful and even beneficial to people, but they certainly won't boast about expensive consumer goods or a "fat" bank account.
I haven't experienced many things like this in the company I work for.
HR is calm, managers look after their management and they don't stick their noses into anything.
Regular evaluations do take place, in the form that it happens here (set some goals for the next year, in a year we'll see what worked and what didn't) - it's more of a self-evaluation, rather than someone evaluating you based on some numbers, and so on.
Corporate events are also optional.
But we are a bit unique within our company - there are departments that are more "corporate".
Sometimes you feel like we're this quasi-startup squatting in the offices of a big corporation, you know.
But it doesn't bother us too much as long as the results are there.
The Czech woman missing in Britain is dead.
Her body was found in London.
British police have been searching for a missing 32-year-old Czech woman for nearly ten days, who disappeared at the end of November.
On Sunday, 12 December, the outgoing Minister of Foreign Affairs, Jakub Kulhánek, announced on social media that the woman from Uherské Hradiště had been found dead.
The British police unfortunately confirmed to our representative office in London this afternoon that they had found the body of the missing Czech citizen.
The cause of death is under investigation.
With regard to the family, we will not be releasing any more information about the case.
My sincere condolences, Kulhánek wrote on Twitter.
The young woman was last seen on November 28 on a bus on her way home from work. She had just withdrawn money from an ATM.
Her disappearance was reported by her work colleagues five days later.
The London police then began to search for her, and Interpol listed her as missing worldwide.
It also appeared in the Czech database of missing persons.
The police have already detained one man in connection with this.
She did not reveal what role he was suspected of playing in the case.
In four municipalities, new councils were elected at the end of the year
On Saturday, 11 December, new councils were elected in the villages of Komňa in the Uherské Hradiště region, Lužice in the Most region, Nová Ves in the Liberec region, and Rovná in the Pelhřimov region.
The number of councillors in these municipalities has fallen below the number set by law or the elected councils have collapsed.
In the new elections, 99 valid candidates were running for the 28 seats.
Voter turnout was 62.41%.
The highest turnout was recorded in the village of Rovná, where 93.62% of eligible voters cast their ballots.
The mandate was won by a total of 8 women and 20 men.
The average age of the elected representatives is 46.7 years.
The oldest is 69 years old, the youngest is 33 years old.
A total of 13 candidate lists were registered for the new elections to the councils in the four municipalities.
36 women and 63 men were running for the 28 council seats.
The average age of the candidates was 46.6 years.
The youngest candidate was 22 years old, the oldest 72.
The processing of the results of Saturday's elections symbolically closes a rather demanding, but successful year for us.
Four new or repeated elections to municipal councils and, above all, the highly watched elections to the Chamber of Deputies took place.
We had to work in more difficult epidemic conditions, which put greater demands on equipment and personnel, said Eva Krumpová, the first deputy chairwoman of the Czech Statistical Office.
The last polling station was counted at 03:49 on Sunday 12 December.
The State Election Commission will discuss the results on Monday and after approval, they will be published in the Collection of Laws.
This is the biggest problem I have with the whole pandemic.
It took me a while to get used to the fact that we have a very dangerous infectious disease here, but it went without any major problems.
I have a problem with how a large part of the population at all its levels is so idiotic about it.
I am most looking forward to the vaccination (tomorrow!) because thanks to it, I will finally be less dependent on the fact that other people are not assholes.
He would be removed from the presidency and disqualified from ever holding it again.
However, as others have mentioned, the chances of this actually happening are very small.
In addition, I'm not sure if the destruction of documents could be considered treason.
Treason is an act by which the President of the Republic endangers the sovereignty, territorial integrity, or the democratic character of the state.
It must have been something more serious.
How the pandemic has affected intimate life: The number of people under 35 who are without sex for a whole year is growing
More and more young adults in the U.S. are living their lives without sex.
It is mainly religious people, says the DailyMail website.
The survey found that the proportion of people under 35 who abstain from sex has risen from eight to 21 per cent between 2008 and 2021.
Women aged 18 to 35 who say they have not had sex in the past year are at an all-time high.
Other factors are also contributing to the decline in the number of sexually active people, according to a survey by the Institute for Family Studies (IFS).
One of them could be the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic and a higher unemployment rate.
However, the presence of the media, social networks or video games, which make sex less and less of a priority for young people, could also have played a part.
"Since 2010, there has been a rapid increase in the share of men and women aged 18-35 who report not having had sex in the past year," said IFS researcher Lyman Stone.
In married people, sexual activity is more common, with only 5% of them saying they had no sex in the last year in 2021.
For singles, it was 29 percent. Stone added that marriage under the age of 35 is only a small percentage.
The decline in sexual activity is also due to the fear of premarital sex and religious beliefs.
While married couples are more likely to be sexually active, the percentage of married and cohabiting women under 35 is still falling.
Young people are divided on premarital sex, with about 30% seeing it as a bad thing and about 70% seeing it as okay.
"It's true that they are a minority among single people in this age group, but their behavior is shifting the trend," Stone says of the 30 percent.
For most of those who have a moral problem with premarital sex, the reason is religious.
Among single people under 35 who attend religious services more than once a month, the rate of abstinence has increased from 20 per cent to almost 60 per cent since 2008.
Among the "less religious," the trend has risen from 10 to 20 percent," Stone said.
Other factors, such as less social interaction and especially social drinking of alcohol during the pandemic, also contribute to the decline in sexual activity.
The study also showed that the likelihood of sex is lower for people who are unemployed or have lower incomes.
Another reason could be the expansion of digital media, which apparently reduces the need for sex.
People are spending more time online, which is "substituting" for this need.
This trend has taken hold mainly during the lockdown period of the coronavirus pandemic.
The whole Covid vaccination mandate is about whether society should force a portion of the population to do something they don't want to do, but that could save their lives.
It's a pretty tough question, and the one I'm most interested in personally is the question of social conscience.
That is, for example, the question of whether if we don't tell them and they die, it will be our fault.
My argument is that we could certainly have been responsible for the death of an eighty-year-old man who didn't really know much, we didn't explain it well to him, he heard some misinformation, and as a result, he didn't get vaccinated and eventually caught it and died.
On the other hand, I don't think we can be blamed for the death of a stubborn vaccination opponent who rants here alongside the SPD and the KSČ about bullying and a totalitarian state.
From the statistics I mentioned, it is quite clear that the majority of unvaccinated pensioners probably belong to the second group, so they will be able to blame themselves for it.
The Czech Republic without snow.
How will a mild winter affect the fight against drought?
This year's winter has brought one of the smallest snowfalls in recent times in the Czech Republic.
Ski resorts cannot do without artificial snow, and the weather also complicates the preparation of the Jizerská 50 cross-country skiing race.
Is it a trend or an exception?
What will little snow mean for the fight against drought in the Czech Republic?
I have one story, but it's not about the plate-licker.
One time in middle school, our teacher led us across the whole city to the boathouse so we could take a boat ride on the river.
On the way there, we walked down a fairly wide street and in the middle of the street we saw a Hare Krishna devotee.
Of course, they came down on us.
I was lucky enough to escape, but one of my friends got into a conversation with them.
When she left them, we asked her and the teacher what she told them.
"They asked me if I wanted to save my soul.
I told them I don't have a soul," she replied.
We all, including the teacher, laughed all the way to the boathouse.
We are so pampered.
Not much is happening, but the system is already collapsing, says Orozovič
New German Chancellor Olaf Scholz arrived in Warsaw on Sunday after previous visits to Paris and Brussels, where he was greeted with military honors by Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki.
"We are opening a new chapter in our relations," Morawiecki said at a joint press conference after the meeting.
Scholz stressed that Europe must show together that it will not accept the violation of Ukraine's territorial integrity.
The chancellor said the crisis caused by the disturbing movements of Russian troops near the Ukrainian border should be resolved through diplomatic efforts, including within the "Normandy group" of France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine.
Morawiecki said he informed the chancellor about the situation on the Polish border with Belarus, whose leader Alexander Lukashenko has artificially created a migration crisis and is using people as human shields and weapons, because we record hundreds of attempts to (illegally) cross the border every night.
I discussed further sanctions with the Chancellor to ensure that the Lukashenko regime and its patrons in the Kremlin finally understand that we are determined to defend the eastern border of the EU.
According to the DPA agency, Scholz assured that Warsaw enjoys German support in the dispute with Belarus and condemned the inhumane treatment of refugees by the Lukashenko regime.
Drunk Polish nun caused accident, tried to cover it up
The car returned to the scene of the accident after a while, but this time it was driven by another nun who was trying to take the blame.
When the police officers told her that she could still lose her driving licence for failing to give way and leaving the scene of the accident, she came clean, TVN24 reported.
She admitted that another nun had crashed into the vehicle and asked for help.
The police then came for Celestina's sister.
She was breathalysed and her licence was immediately revoked after she was found to have more than two-and-a-half times the legal limit in her blood.
At the same time, they informed her that she would be questioned about her actions in court.
Hugo the dog is doing his best.
Juraj Šajmovič, however, did not keep an eye on his film.
Czech creators of family comedies have taken a liking to American stories about pampered dogs.
They forgot about one important thing though: the laws of the film industry.
After the kitschy film F. Brabec's Gump - the dog who taught people to live, another film is now vying for the audience's emotions in the cinemas - We Keep Watch Here.
The co-writer and director in one person, Juraj Šajmovič Jr., loosely follows up on his previous film Tady hlídám já from 2012.
The talking Dachshund, Hugo, returns to the scene, along with some familiar characters around him.
Julie and Ivan, the owners of a dying pension in the Šumava mountains, start inviting dog walkers, Julie's father with his partner and especially her daughter Veronika.
She is no longer a little girl, but a young woman experiencing her first love.
The director and his partner, Beatriz Šajmovičová (who is also the film's producer), struggled with storytelling techniques in their previous dog film, but at least the children and the dog were entertained.
This time, the creative duo wrote an even weaker script that evokes a mixture of horror and feelings of embarrassment.
Let's recap.
Julie, despite being a scientist, succumbs to the darkness of her desire for a child, and when the right "constellation" occurs, she copulates with her forest engineer Ivan, wherever the coordinates dictate - on the hood of a car or a church tower (of course, during an ongoing excursion with a local guide), the retired colonel Mojmír, despite years of training, shoots his own daughter (Julie) in the forest, who falls into a coma, after which she is taken away by her family to the hospital, so that a miraculous healing process can take place in the heart of the Bohemian Forest solitude with the help of a dog.
Nothing wrong with a nature cleanse and the power of animal snuggles.
Their owners know why they have them.
The viewer is left wondering how much of a load of rubbish full of implausible situations and characters was needed to convey this message.
A pair of thieves from the staff, a dog show, a charlatan from the Šumava, police officers arriving on a tip-off to look for "drugs" and discussing the fertilizing power of bone meal over herbs - and of course, the baked family in the pension gets them drunk.
When the heroine wakes from a coma and sits at the family table, permed and made-up with a cigarette, demanding her father's whiskey and a steak as a cured vegetarian, you can't help but laugh.
On top of that, the creators explain to the viewer that "this sometimes happens after a coma."
Šajmovič's team lacks basic dramaturgical knowledge of working with text, the ability to build up the main situations, a sense for the characters' traits and the point, and directorial guidance.
The acting is uneven, the editing is aimless, and the overall impression is muddled.
As much as Lukáš Vaculík, Jitka Ježková or Nela Boudová try to hold their own, they don't have much to work with.
The only positive aspect of the film remains the poetic shots of the Šumava nature by cinematographer Vladimír Holomek and the pair of dachshunds.
It is not enough to sketch a few characters, a flimsy plot and dog jokes, not to mention the more common vulgar expressions that the characters use.
Neither is the long-standing membership of the Dachshund Breeders Club - as in the case of the lady producer.
For good intentions to promote nature and the friendship between man and dog, there must also be knowledge of the craft, if one wants to tell a believable story.
This was not the case in this instance.
There is a bit too much eroticism and a minimum of feeling for the genre in a good family photo.
Even as an advertisement for canine therapy, this amateurish piece would not have passed.
Yes, respect, because they have to listen to constant insults from idiots like you.
There is a difference between offering and forcing, here you can see how you don't understand it, but that is only because you have never tried it.
The decision is always up to the customer, if they don't want it, the answer will always be no.
If you listened to those kids all the time, you might change your mind.
It's a job like any other, in this case a side hustle.
The Middle East is experiencing unusually dry months.
Winter is the only time of the year when it rains.
"The almost complete absence of rainfall during November, as recorded at some stations, is unusual," the Israel Meteorological Service confirms.
For example, the village of Kfar Giladi in northern Israel reported only six percent of its long-term average rainfall for November.
The two-day rain this week was therefore more of an exception.
It's good for us.
It hasn't rained for a long time.
It is also the right Christmas backdrop, rejoiced Nazareth resident Wasím Aškar.
Precipitation in Israel comes almost exclusively in the winter months, is sporadic and irregular.
The forests are dependent on winter rains.
Without them, they dry out and are prone to fires.
It's not just about forests, but also about drinking water supplies and irrigation for farmers.
Israel's largest freshwater source, the Sea of Galilee, has filled to the brim this spring, thanks to three consecutive rainy winters.
Since then, the level has fallen.
The water managers have been warning about the drought for a long time.
"It is expected that, depending on global warming and climate change, there may be less rainfall here," said Uri Schor, a spokesperson for the Israel Water Authority, in 2018.
Israel can help itself with technologies such as desalination or wastewater recycling.
Economically weak countries such as Lebanon, Syria and Jordan are worse off.
In the streets of Jordan's capital, Amman, tanker trucks are becoming more common.
Water mains and private wells are drying up.
"This year, my orders have increased by 70 to 80 percent compared to the previous two years," tanker truck driver Imad Suleiman said in September.
Clashes broke out between farmers and security forces in the Iranian city of Isfahan.
The reason for the protests was the drought.
The bed of the local river was completely dry.
The region has experienced its driest November in many recent years.
Israel prepares military strike against Iran
The Israeli defense minister said the Vienna talks had made "no progress" and that he had informed Washington of preparations for an attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.
Defense Minister Benny Gantz said on Saturday that he had instructed the Israel Defense Forces to prepare for the possibility of a military strike against Iran, reports Jonathan Lis.
Gantz, who is in the United States, is trying to convince Americans to increase pressure on Iran, but also informed Washington about military preparations.
During a press conference in Florida, Gantz said that the nuclear talks in Vienna have not brought "any progress" and that the world powers "understand that the Iranians are playing with them."
This also happened to me about 3 years ago.
I grilled the lady a bit and grilled her during the conversation to find out what she actually wanted from me.
I eventually discovered that my suspicions of a pyramid scheme were justified.
Because I really don't like these tricks, I kept the lady waiting for a while with doubts and questions and finally thanked her and left.
Feel free to call me a scoundrel, but a pyramid is a pyramid and financial advisors are financial advisors.
Skiers headed to the mountains over the weekend, where there was plenty of snow and good weather
The Czech mountain resorts experienced the first major influx of skiers this weekend.
After the heavy snowfall at the end of the working week, there is no shortage of snow and some ski resorts have opened.
The skiers were not deterred by the requirement to show a COVID certificate at the ski lifts.
While tow operators aren't complaining about a lack of customers, some ski equipment rental shops are reporting weaker demand for their services than before the pandemic.
Thousands of people took to the cross-country ski trails and ski slopes in the Liberec Region over the weekend.
The weather was kind to the skiers today, offering both sunshine and excellent snow conditions.
"We are satisfied, the opening weekend really started on Friday evening when we had the first skiers on the hill," praised the director of the Ještěd Sports Area, Jakub Hanuš.
Hundreds of people headed to the Jeseníky Mountains for the first weekend of skiing in the new season.
Ski Aréna Karlov and the centre in Branná in the Šumperk region were open.
Weekend attendance was very good, with an estimated 400 people on Saturday and today.
The conditions are great.
Today the sun was shining, it was around minus three degrees, so perfect, said Rostislav Procházka, the representative of the ski resort in Branná.
Ski resort operators can only sell lift tickets to people who are vaccinated or have recently recovered from COVID-19.
With the exception of a few people, people are prepared and show the necessary documents, said René Hroneš from the Špindlerův Mlýn ski centre to ČTK.
"We've only seen a handful of incidents," he added.
Some ski rental and equipment stores are reporting less demand than before the pandemic.
Fortunately, there is interest in renting skis.
It is not like in previous years, but there are still enough customers, said Alexandra Bokišová from the Opava Skiopava store.
They expect a greater influx of visitors during the ski courses.
The manager of the Hradec Králové company Snowbear, David Šinták, also feels that due to the coronavirus, there is not as much interest in renting ski equipment as there used to be.
By this time before the pandemic, we were already being loaned out.
Compared to the period before the pandemic, we are at about 50 percent, Šinták told ČTK.
According to him, people have become lazy during the pandemic and have learned to sit at home.
On the other hand, the rental shop in the Novako area of Boží Dar is experiencing high demand.
They started renting skis there a week ago and those interested have to order them in advance.
"We start renting skis this weekend, but people have already called in advance, so we expect a lot of interest, just like last year," said the facility's operator, Pavlína Nováková.
According to her, the interest is comparable to the period before the epidemic also in the ski school.
If we want successful and wealthy people not to leave the country, they must have the opportunity to live a quality life like abroad.
Socialist healthcare, where it is often not possible to find a dentist or a specialist doctor, is certainly not part of it.
The smart and capable people who have no property here are leaving the country.
The owner of the company is not just going to leave for abroad.
I agree with the rest, though.
If these people do not live well in the Czech Republic and if these people do not see a reasonable future in the Czech Republic, then they will not live in the Czech Republic.
The emigration from Hungary began when one day Orbán won, he ruled for a year and suddenly the annual emigration rose by a few tens of thousands.
It is naive to think that the Czech Republic can find itself in a similar position overnight.
Another question is whether the elections will take place at all.
When things get bad here, a traditional V4 lunatic can also win.
The young and educated will leave, leaving behind his supporters and people whose property can't be stuffed into an airplane.
Scary photo!
Langmajer in the blood due to a bet on beer?
While autumn was in full swing in the Czech Republic, the crew of the film The Island, led by Jiří Langmajer (55), was enjoying the tropical weather in Thailand!
The actor posted a bloody photo of his face on social media.
Is it a real injury or is it makeup for filming?
The London police are still looking for the missing Czech woman.
She was last seen on her way home.
"Petra's disappearance is completely out of character and we are becoming increasingly concerned for her welfare," said Lucy O'Connor of the Lambeth police station, where Ms. Srncova worked, in a Saturday video.
"Her family in the Czech Republic is also very worried about her and just wants to know where she is," she continued.
According to her, the missing Czech woman left work around 7:45 p.m. on Sunday, November 28, and headed home to the Camberwell district.
She was last seen on a bus about half an hour later.
Her disappearance was reported on December 3 by one of her colleagues.
According to British media, Srncová worked as a "nursing assistant" at the Evelina London Children's Hospital, which is part of the Guy's and St Thomas' hospital group.
"We are deeply concerned about our dear colleague Petra who is missing," the group of medical facilities said in a tweet.
"We would like to encourage anyone who may have any information that could assist in locating her to contact police," the statement continued.
MP Harriet Harman also called on the public to come forward with information about the case of Srncová, which she highlighted at a press conference on Saturday.
"She's been missing for a few days, she's only 32 years old, she's from the Czech Republic, her parents are understandably distraught," said the Labour politician, holding up a photograph of the woman distributed by London police.
"I feel like we all have a special responsibility to try to find her because she was away from home, away from her family and working here for our health care," Harman said.
Police have previously arrested one man in connection with the case, who remains in custody.
However, the BBC reports that the police have not released any information about the man's identity or what he is suspected of.
Russia is not capable of occupying Ukraine, and certainly not with 30 BTG (i.e. about 5 divisions).
I don't underestimate Ukraine either.
This is not "a huge amount", but about 8 percent of the Russian army.
Notice that Ukraine is constantly repeating that we are exaggerating the threat of invasion and is starting to get fed up with our intervention.
I quoted above.
I don't know where he got the idea that Russia wants war.
War is a damn expensive joke and Russia has the GDP of Italy.
The comparison with the situation in 1938 is so far off in so many points that I don't even know where to start.
Now I can compare it to the First Punic War and the "annexation" of Sicily :D
I can imagine that after Ukraine announced that it would not comply with the Minsk agreements, Russia annexed those ridiculous republics.
That is all there is to it, and that is what the "concentration" at the borders would correspond to.
Yes, pacta sunt servanda...
New timetables come into force in Prague on Sunday, mainly affecting suburban services
Passengers in Prague's integrated transport system (PID) can expect several changes from Sunday, which will mainly affect suburban services.
New lines have been created, some have changed their routes, and others have disappeared.
The Mladá Boleslav region is now joining the integrated system.
From Sunday, express trains from České Budějovice will stop at the Zahradní Město station in the capital.
The S7 suburban trains will run on the route from Beroun to Český Brod, passing through the Prague main station.
The recently opened station in Prague-Zahradní Město will now be served by the R17 express train from České Budějovice and Benešov.
The PID will now be extended to other areas.
Buses will also go as far as Světlá nad Sázavou, Blatná near Jesenice, Staré Splavy and Turnov.
Buses in the Mladá Boleslav region will be included, including lines with connections to the Liberec and Hradec Králové regions.
During the integration, 77 lines will be cancelled, 37 new lines will be introduced and the operation of 12 existing lines will be adjusted.
A new bus line 405 will depart from Prague's Zličín, which will go all the way to Žatec.
A new direct connection between Prague and Kralovice near Rakovník has also been established, replacing the discontinued S53 train line.
The morning peak and weekend services from Prague to Rakovník will be strengthened, with the new express line number 404.
The PID system now includes lines 400 and 410 running to the Liberec region.
They depart from the Střížkov metro station, not from the Holešovice train station.
The 400 spine line runs through Mělník, Dubá and Česká Lípa to Nový Bor, and selected services continue to Rumburk or Cvikov.
The additional line 410 runs through Mělník and Dubá to Doksy, Mimoň and Jablonné v Podještědí.
On the other hand, the operation of dozens of local lines in the Central Bohemian region has been cancelled or restricted, including lines to Mochov, Dobříš and Rožmitál pod Třemšínem.
All trains departing from Prague at 02:30 have been cancelled.
Due to the modernisation of the railway, long-term restrictions continue on the Prague – Beroun, Prague – Lysá nad Labem and in the vicinity of Kolín lines.
Changes are also coming for passengers at other locations.
Buses are replacing some of the cancelled train lines or the section of line 420 from Dobříš with connections from Prague, where it is possible to use PID tickets all the way to Milevsko.
The routes of lines 540 to 543 in Nymburk have been changed, and the routes of some buses on the border of Central Bohemia and Hořovice in the Pilsen Region have been adjusted.
Healthy snack/lunch for the office from the supermarket
Hi, I do the classic 9-5 with a 30min break and my only option to get food is to go next door to Billa or a bit further to Lidl.
Since I don't have any movement, I don't have the strength to exercise after work, so I have to eat as healthily and as diet-friendly as possible.
Unfortunately, I never know what to buy, and in a hurry, I'll buy at most a pizza roll, and for a snack, a yogurt and an apple.
Question: What healthy food without the need for heat treatment would you recommend me to buy in a supermarket?
Not everyone is waiting for a metre of snow like you, so it is, unfortunately.
And it's not just trees that you have to see.
Only the tip of the tree can be hidden under the snow.
If damaged, the tree may be more susceptible to fungal diseases.
I'm not saying it's the only reason they don't allow us to ski off-piste, but it's one of them.
Dara's confession about her relationship with Nedvěd: I was not looking forward to this at all
The Czech showbiz pond has been abuzz since Friday with nothing other than the revelation of the relationship between Dara Rolins and Pavel Nedvěd.
They have been together since the summer, and the famous footballer even got a divorce because of the singer.
Dara now sent a long message to her fans, in which she explains why she kept her love a secret from them for six months.
"I dare to say that currently there is no one in the Czech Republic or Slovakia who would not know that Dara caught a bear, i.e. pardon, Nedvěd," jokes Dara Rolins, who is head over heels in love with the most successful Czech football player.
He is said to have dumped her, not the other way around.
Three days are the focus of attention, and although they are used to public interest, they do not enjoy it.
And it's here.
The thing we both didn't look forward to, but knew it would happen, continued the singer.
I just don't know who is worse off.
Whether it is those who are not interested at all and it pops up on them even from a can, or us, whose lives are dissected in detail.
As if someone wanted to hear your opinion on whether you and your husband or girlfriend are a good match, or if you insisted that everyone really knew the list of your former partners in detail and were familiar with the list of your mistakes and faults.
That's just the way it is, you want it, it bothers Dára.
The couple got together in Italy, where Rolins was travelling for the preparation of her new fashion collection.
Nedvěd has been working as the vice president of the Juventus football club for a long time.
They only came out with the truth now, because they were waiting for the conclusion of Nedvěd's divorce.
He has been separated from his wife Ivana for three years, and they have only been legally divorced for three weeks.
In any case, we thank those who rejoice with us and wish us well.
We are just people, we have families, children, pasts and dreams.
We're not perfect, but I think we both have our hearts in the right place.
I love my new man and just like him, I stand by him. In good times and in bad, concluded Rolins.
Hi, other commenters have probably said everything important, I just confirm that the dorms are great for the beginning, my classmates mostly got to know each other and became friends during the first semester or two and then found sublets together, which I think is the best option because you know who you will be living with.
Apartments are usually not advertised very far in advance, so you probably won't find much now, but it won't hurt to take a look at the offers.
Otherwise, definitely avoid not only Cejl, but also the surrounding area (streets like Vranovská, Francouzská, etc., that's a pretty bad address), and some parts of Židenice are a bit of a ghetto.
On the other hand, the Veveří district is very student-oriented, Královo Pole and the direction towards it is nice, and it's close to most of the VUT faculties (I don't know exactly where you're starting).
I have never looked for a rental, but I am a native of Brno, so I can give you some advice about Brno in general if you need more information.
This is an example of "normal" thinking to me.
It is actually perfectly fine that the state does not sufficiently fund some schools, because of what a few doctors decided to do somewhere in Poland.
Either they can learn what they want and pay for it themselves, or they can follow the state curriculum and the state can pay for it.
We cannot allow a private actor to take over a part of the education system just because they add a few crowns to the full-fledged state contribution and can therefore teach whatever they want in schools.
Such a statement loses some of its weight when it is written by a person who two days earlier expressed himself in this way about a petition calling for a boycott of the totalitarian state:
So a vote against someone having an abortion is the same as a vote against a statue standing in a square?
I would consult with the person who gave you the job.
Otherwise, I have already experienced during the cataloging/digitization that (and even long-term professionals) either eyeball it or write something like xxx *** or ... (according to convention) and in the note that it is unreadable.
The truth is that in this case it is quite readable, so I would not recommend it.
Personally, I would deal with it in a note, depending on what program you're using.
If you wanted to be a proper and diligent student, you could look up some branded databases and find the nearest one.
But since it looks like you're drawing from a book, I would guess that the author or printer simply created their own symbol that fits with what is physically on the coin.
PS: It is not by chance that it is rather the Kingdom of Odrysia than the Kingdom of Odryna?
PSS: Someone has already cracked it for you here.
Check out that comment with ΦΙΛH
Politicians don't even know what the "theme" of our presidency will be.
That is a much bigger mess than having interpreters with them.
The idea that they would pass something because nobody understood some text is laughable.
All important approved documents are examined word for word, and a basic knowledge of English is not enough for that, it is a matter for lawyers.
Hundreds of translators and interpreters work in various EU institutions, and English is more suitable for politicians for informal contacts and the establishment of above-standard relations.
And with the English language, it's quite interesting after GB left the EU.
I don't understand the hate towards Ceylon.
I've been working there for three years now and I'm doing just fine.
I often drive home from work at 10pm and have never had any problems.
Only someone who has hardly ever set foot in the ghetto can say that it is a ghetto.
Yes, most of the Roma population of Brno lives there, but all they do is block the sidewalk and park where they shouldn't. It's definitely not the case that I would be afraid to go out on the street at night.
So if you are looking for relatively cheap accommodation with good access to the city centre, I would go for it.
There are a lot of newly renovated or newly built apartments there.
Felix Slováček (78) without Dada and his mistress Gelemová as a stick in the fence!
Who will you spend Christmas with?
On Sunday, most people lit the first candle on their Advent wreath, but Felix Slováček did not.
I don't have an Advent wreath, so there was nothing to light.
I have seen the wreath and Lucie probably has one too, said the saxophonist to Blesk, thus confirming Patrasová's words that he often visits her.
He visits, but does not live in their house in Vinohrady, where Dáda was left alone after his departure.
Slováček still doesn't know where he will be on Christmas Eve.
We recently met with Anička, Felix and both grandchildren.
VIDEO: Felix Slováček and Lucie Gelemová: TOGETHER AGAIN!
Felix Slováček and Lucie Gelemová: TOGETHER AGAIN!
But we kept talking, so Christmas never came.
I really don't know where I'll be.
I buy gifts all the time and I will definitely buy something for Dad and Lucie, probably a perfume.
I'm a gentleman, added Felix, who came to the launch of the music video alone to the Richman club.
I'm here alone, but I don't feel alone.
I always find someone to have a good time with, says Slováček, who was happy to meet the wife of Luďek Sobota, Adriana, or singer Kamila Nývltová.
And he made it clear.
And we are Iceland, so we can afford not to have soldiers and weapons?
I doubt that anyone will defend us, and our location is so strategic that the aggressor would have to be a complete idiot not to occupy this territory.
And I don't understand why it should be a bad argument, can you explain that to me?
I don't know of any other component that could be deployed in hospitals in a crisis.
There are not enough police officers and they cannot afford it, the same goes for firefighters and nowhere else is there such a high percentage of medically trained people at such a level.
And the fact that our army is capable of defending just enough Ostrava goes on the heads of previous governments, not the army, which has been asking for new toys for quite some time.
Record drought in the Czech Republic.
It is necessary to change agricultural subsidies, the countryside is not just a food factory, says the journalist.
The Czech Republic is experiencing the worst drought in recent years.
According to scientists, the water has decreased in the mountainous and foothill regions, and even places that have not yet experienced a shortage of moisture are recording lower rainfall totals.
The cause of the drought in much of Central Europe is climate change.
However, the way we manage the soil also has an impact.
What should you prepare for in connection with the drought?
And how can we help nature in these difficult times?
Yeah, it's going to be like that, I can barely stay on my skates on the ice, I know what it's like to play hockey and that tactic (which I tried in Franchise Hockey Manager) is also generally a load of rubbish.
And whether you're a hockey team "Russia the bear" or "China the llama," losing by two goals when you don't have to win at all costs is different than when it's even.
But anyway, what I hear from Czech commentators, who point out what the referees do or don't pay attention to, whether it's men's or women's hockey, it's all strange, but that's how it is with all sports, UEFA and "Italian actors" or motorsport F1, WRC, etc.
Controversy is everywhere.
And in my opinion, if it were the other way around, it would be like always, and that the Czech Republic has lost to Russia more often than won, it would probably be the classic "they lost" vs "WE won".
Coronavirus: Russia's caseload tops 10 million
On Saturday, December 11, the Czech Republic recorded 9080 daily infections.
5766 people are in hospital.
In total, 34,451 people died in the Czech Republic, and another 74.
The confirmed cases in the last 14 days are 1967 per 100,000, 871 per 100,000 in the last week.
The number of infections in Russia exceeded 10 million on Sunday.
In the past 24 hours, 29,929 new infections have been registered.
It's the lowest daily count since Oct. 13.
The total number of registered infections in Russia is 10,016,896.
The daily death toll is 1,132, the lowest daily death toll since late October.
Britain is facing an "inevitable" large wave of infections caused by Omicron, Dr Susan Hopkins, the chief medical adviser to the UK Health Security Agency, said on Sunday.
New quarantine measures will be required.
People with Omicron are already in hospital in the UK and Hopkins expects that number to rise.
So far, no one has died from the omicron variant, but hospitalizations occur about 14 days after infection and deaths about three weeks after infection.
Labour leader Keir Starmer said on Sunday that Boris Johnson appeared to have broken the law by holding a Christmas quiz at Downing Street in December last year when a lockdown was in place and Christmas parties were banned.
One minister in Johnson's government defended the quiz as having taken place "virtually," via a computer.
But it was attended by groups of staff gathered around computers in Downing Street.
Pressure is mounting in Britain for Johnson to step down as prime minister.
During last December, when a strict lockdown was introduced in London and Christmas parties were banned, Johnson's ministers held numerous parties despite the lockdown.
The British public and media are furious that Johnson and his government are making a mockery of them:
Paul Brand, ITV's editor for commercial television in Britain: Two years ago today, Boris Johnson won a landslide victory in the general election.
This morning, the Conservative Party is talking about removing him from the position of prime minister.
Remarkably, events have moved so quickly.

Hungary is due to hold elections in the spring that could end Viktor Orban's 12-year rule.
They will be elections of European-wide significance.
How fair can we expect them to be?
They won't be fair.
They will probably not be free either, because the last two elections under Orbán were not free either.
His Fidesz party controls the media, changes electoral district boundaries to its advantage, and does other small or large tricks.
The most recent one sounds like everyone can choose where they want in practice.
This will allow Fidesz to transport voters from decided districts to those where the outcome is uncertain and the opposition could win.
So I'm just repeating that they won't be fair at all.
Do you think it will be as unfair as in 2014 and 2018?
After all, the situation is very different.
Before, it was not about whether Fidesz would win, but by how much and whether it would have a constitutional majority.
Now there is a real chance that the united opposition will win more votes and seats.
This is a big change for Viktor Orbán and his party.
Will they play even harder in an effort to hold on to power?
Yes, we have some indications that they are ready to go beyond what they have done so far.
Recently, a recording of the Speaker of Parliament and one of the leaders of Fidesz, László Kövér, was leaked to independent media, in which he explains to the heads of the secret services that the opposition is a threat to national security.
Are these the hints of a new approach you're talking about?
Yes, that is one of the new things.
It all starts with the tongue.
I was beaten quite often, the last time when I was 14, my mother doesn't have much patience, neither do I, my father has it for a long time, but then he hits me extremely (only in connection with me).
I am also very choleric and I used to get very angry when I was little, to the extent that I would lie on the ground in a fit of rage and turn blue, they would have to take me under the shower to calm me down.
Sometimes they would spank me as a form of discipline, sometimes it was more that they didn't know what else to do.
I definitely have a tendency to solve things with violence now too, I used to fight a lot when I was little, now I at least hit something to let off steam, and when I was younger I might have slapped my parents on the hand, for example (so that I didn't get hit too hard), so nothing extreme, but I always have this urge.
I'm not able to determine to what extent it is due to my explosive nature, but certainly the upbringing also has its part to play.
I'm afraid that I'll also lose patience with my kids and handle it the same way.
I think that hitting children is just wrong and that my parents shouldn't have done it, especially not at that moment when it was no longer "educational" but out of frustration. On the other hand, I think that every parent messes up at some point; it's probably not possible to not mess up your children at least a little, so I don't hold it against them.
I'm not offended by it, I don't understand why the OP should be ashamed of it.
Laws should be clear and unambiguous.
I would call Kundas those who create laws in such quality.
Otherwise, I would be interested to know if you are afraid of losing your income?
Can you really count on people wanting and buying the product, and will you have enough money to pay the mortgage?
Kočner's monstrous world.
Where will Slovakia move the trial of the killers of journalist Kuciak?
The main trial in the case of the four accused of the murder of Ján Kuciak and Martina Kušnírová begins in Slovakia.
The death of the investigative reporter and his partner changed Slovakia.
It mobilised civil society, but also revealed the practices of the accused businessman Marián Kočner and his connections to the top echelons of Slovak politics and justice.
How will the process be a turning point for Slovakia?
Journalists are to blame for this.
How is it possible that this petition received a lot more media attention than the counter-petition of the deans of all medical faculties, which was released a day or two later?
No, they let themselves be fooled and the company jumped ship.

Another government ends and the law on the involvement of municipalities in the selection of a repository is nowhere
Minister Karel Havlíček's proposal needs a major overhaul
The government of Prime Minister Andrej Babiš is coming to an end and the law that was supposed to ensure the respect of the interests of municipalities and their citizens in the selection and approval of a deep geological repository for high-level radioactive waste still does not exist.
The government's legislative council suspended the discussion of the proposal, which the Ministry of Industry and Trade submitted to the government after years of delays.
However, its content is in serious conflict not only with the affected municipalities associated in the Platform against the Deep Repository, but also with the Union of Towns and Municipalities of the Czech Republic.
Municipalities expect a significant strengthening of their decision-making powers with regard to the repository, which has been promised to mayors since 2011, when the first work on this legislation began, and which is required by the Czech Atomic Act and the European Directive.
We expect the new government to revise the proposal in cooperation with the municipalities in accordance with its coalition agreement.
The draft law by Minister Karel Havlíček, which Platforma has at its disposal, is criticized by municipalities mainly for the following: The proposed level of involvement of municipalities and the public in the decision-making process for the selection of the site for the repository is insufficient and cannot ensure respect for the interests of municipalities and their citizens.
It can only be truly effective if the municipalities or the public can influence whether the process will continue in a given location.
This can be ensured by imposing an obligation on the Repository Administration to request the consent of the affected municipalities before initiating a specific procedure.
The proposed draft of the land-use plan almost completely ignores the involvement of the public and turns the citizens of the municipalities into mere extras in the permitting process.
The draft lacks a systematic setting of compensations for municipalities for the entire process of searching for and selecting a site for the repository, its permitting, and operation.
According to today's legal regulations, representatives of municipalities do not have many options to defend the interests of their citizens when looking for a place for a repository.
Only in some permitting procedures can they submit their comments or appeal, but the authority or minister who is interested in issuing the permit decides.
The potential lawsuit does not have a suspensive effect on the carrying out of survey or construction work.
The co-decision of local authorities, which the Platform is calling for, is a principle commonly used in many democratically advanced countries and certainly in those that have already made progress in allowing storage facilities, such as Sweden and Finland.
The preparation of the law is another failure of the state administration, which hires external law firms to prepare legislation.
In this case, it is a contract with the law firm HAVEL & PARTNERS s.r.o., which was concluded by SÚRAO and follows on from contracts with lawyer Jan Zemánek.
According to the contract register, the total sum for this work is almost 4 million crowns.
Antonín Seknička, deputy mayor of the village of Cejle from the Hrádek area and spokesperson for the Platform against the Deep Geological Repository, said: After the ministers of industry, who only postponed the alignment of the position of local authorities towards state authorities in the search for a deep geological repository for highly radioactive waste to their successors, we expect a more significant change from the new government.
We also offer a helping hand.
We would also like to thank the Association of Towns and Municipalities, which perceives the issue of insufficient rights of municipalities for such a fundamental construction in a similar way as the directly affected municipalities in selected locations.
The platform against the deep repository brings together 51 members (35 municipalities and towns and 16 associations) to promote a change in the state's approach to dealing with spent nuclear fuel and other radioactive waste, which will not be limited to the deep repository.
The platform also advocates that the decision on the selection of a site for potential storage should be subject to the prior consent of the affected municipalities.
John Goodman (69) was scared into losing weight: He lost 90 kg.
Although he had no need to change his lifestyle for many years, he was eventually scared by doctors.
They told him that if he didn't lose weight, he would die.
And it worked.
Goodman has lost 90 kilograms, which is half of his original weight of 180 kilograms, reports The Sun.
He showed off his new figure in Los Angeles at the premiere of the animated series The Freak Brothers.
The fat guy from the Roseanne sitcom is a completely different person!
John liked to joke that his friends and family had asked him to lose weight because his large body was causing furniture to break.
"I was putting everything in my mouth," the actor said in a 2018 interview with AARP.
This time I wanted to do it slowly.
Move, exercise.
I'm getting to an age where I can't afford to sit on the sidelines, Mr Goodman told ABC, whose transformation is remarkable.
It also depends on what kind of boss and in what context you want to use the word "boss".
If it's some kind of text on a platform that expects readers from the gaming environment, I wouldn't translate it at all.
If it was a formal text, for example a university text, I would probably look for a way to describe or explain the boss.
And there are different types of bosses.
For example, a game like Dark Souls has several bosses, right, and so a "boss" is something like a lord/ruler of a given level, and then there is the final boss...
Many games have hidden bosses (super bosses, hidden bosses) that are not necessary to beat in order to complete the game or level, but are often stronger than regular bosses.
Then there are games like Half-Life, where bosses exist, but the player doesn't directly fight them (Tentacle, Gargantua), and can they be called bosses at all?
And then there are the mini bosses.
It is not really possible to translate the word "boss" in a single word. Czech and other languages do not solve this issue (Catalan, for example, is interesting in this regard, as it translates "boss" as the final opponent).
It is a computer-controlled opponent that is significant to the story or the game in general, stronger than all previous ones and guarding the completion of a level or task.
The whole world is looking for Petra from London.
The Czech police also got involved.
The British police have been looking for missing Petra Srncová since 3 December.
The Czech police also got involved in the search.
She has been looking for the 32-year-old woman from Uherské Hradiště since 7 December.
Interpol is also helping the British police.
Petra Srncová's colleagues last saw her on November 28.
British police have been looking for her since December 3.
Interpol issued a so-called yellow notice for her.
The whole world is looking for Peter.
"The Czech police are working closely with the British police," confirmed police spokeswoman Kateřina Rendlová.
"We are sharing information on the case," she added.
The announced search for Petra has already appeared on the police website.
She is described as 5ft 6in tall, slim, with brown eyes and long straight brown hair.
It is supposed to come from the area of Uherské Hradiště.
Petra worked as a nurse in one of the London hospitals.
Her friends and colleagues are worried about her, as this kind of disappearance is very unusual for her
Local MP Harriet Harman also joined the search for Petra.
She got involved in putting up flyers with Petra's face on them.
"We have huge concerns about her," she said at a Saturday press conference.
In connection with the disappearance, British police have already arrested one suspect.
It is not clear who it is and what he had in common with Petra.
Agent Tesla is terrorizing pre-Christmas Czechia.
While October data showed a slight decline in attack campaigns, last month saw a significant uptick as the year drew to a close.
We recorded a large campaign related to Agent Tesla on November 18.
The attacks are specifically targeted at the Czech Republic.
The attackers' strategy remains the same for now.
The infected attachment in the email is designed to attract the user's attention with a name that refers to payments and financial transactions.
While last month the dangerous attachment had the word invoice in its name, this time it was marked as Copy of repair receipt for 11,2021...exe," said Martin Jirkal from Eset.
The spyware includes features that scan web browsers and other programs, such as Microsoft Outlook, Mozilla Thunderbird and Yandex email clients.
The malicious code actively searches for stored login credentials, which it then sends to the attackers.
The last major campaign in the Czech Republic took place at the end of August and the beginning of September, and with the approaching holidays and the end of the year, the activity of the attackers is once again on the rise.
In November, the Formbook spyware remained active.
Unlike Agent Tesla, the attackers in this case are not specifically targeting the Czech Republic, and security experts have detected campaigns with a global reach in November.
Compared to October's Formbook data, Formbook weakened slightly in November, but still accounts for nearly a fifth of all detections.
The attacks were continuous throughout the month with increased activity on the 3rd, 10th and 15th of November.
The Formbook most often contained an attachment with the .exe extension, which was named REQUEST FOR SPECIFICATION.
However, the term "receipt" continues to be used.
The Czech attachment can then be much more dangerous for a Czech user.
Security analysts have noted a significant decline and dampening of activity in the Fareit program, which was responsible for 1.6 percent of attacks and has not had a major offensive campaign in the Czech Republic for several months.
Today's smart alecks who don't need oxygen because oxygen is for vaccinated idiots.
The march through Prague was larger than the media reported.
According to the footage of the parade along the embankment and according to my experience, I estimate the number of protesters to be around 10,000 people.
People in the procession filled the embankment and the bridge and the opposite embankment road.
That means there are a lot of people.
The procession of about four thousand demonstrators is spontaneously joined by an unprecedented number of passers-by.
I believe that something new is being born here, writes Radek Mokrý.
That persistent dissatisfaction of several large groups or layers of the population led to the fact that they found a common language.
Just the anti-vaxxers, anti-maskers and the like would not be able to fill or pay for such a large procession.
The events of the Chcípl pes association are on the rise in popularity, it reminds me of Milion chvilek pro demokracii naruby.
Sometimes I have the impression that they even rent the same stage and equipment.
It is hard to say what kind of movement could be attracted from this dissatisfaction; it depends not only on the influx of money, but also on whether the three-dose Pfizer vaccine does not become four or more doses.
It will definitely not be a left-wing or centrist movement, you can bet on that.
The three-dose vaccine is almost certainly going to become a multi-dose vaccine, because it's clear that we're going to have to get revaccinated every six months.
I'm very glad that the vaccines saved us.
A brilliant action by scientists, which humanity has every right to be proud of.
End of an era as Bulgaria gets new PM pledging change
Bulgarian President Rumen Radev has tasked Kiril Petkov from the anti-corruption movement We Continue the Change, which won the November elections, to form a new government.
Tom has already managed to put together a broad coalition government that is due to take office in a few days.
The political crisis in the country has been going on since April, when the previous government lost the elections under the weight of anti-corruption protests.
The winning parties that had pledged to fight corruption and abuse of power were unable to reach an agreement, so two more snap elections followed.
What do cats do when no one is watching?
The global hit was "secretly" filmed.
In Britain, concerns grew over the fate of a 32-year-old Czech woman who has been missing for several days and is being sought by London police.
Petra Srncova was last seen two weeks ago when she was driving home from work in the south of the British capital.
In addition to the police, the woman's previous employer and the MP representing the part of London where she lived are also calling in the wake of information about the employee of the children's hospital.
"Petra's disappearance is completely out of character and we are becoming increasingly concerned for her welfare," said Lucy O'Connor of the Lambeth police station, where Srncová worked, in a Saturday video.
"Her family in the Czech Republic is also very worried about her and just wants to know where she is," she continued.
According to her, the missing Czech woman left work around 7:45 p.m. on Sunday, November 28, and headed home to the Camberwell district.
She was last seen on a bus about half an hour later.
Her disappearance was reported on December 3 by one of her colleagues.
According to British media, Srncová worked as a "nursing assistant" at the Evelina London Children's Hospital, which is part of the Guy's and St Thomas' hospital group.
"We have grave concerns for our dear colleague Petra who is missing," the group of medical facilities said in a Twitter post.
"We would like to encourage anyone who may have any information that could assist in locating her to contact police," the statement continued.
The Šumperk amateur painter of children's rooms, Zdeňka Dvořáková Kocourková (and also a regional Pirate councilor), was reported by an anonymous person for violating copyright with her murals.
However, the court ruled that Krteček's paintings in the Šumperk rooms do not violate the law.
In Ústí nad Labem, a hole in the road in the form of a channel without a cover lay there for a month.
It was a matter of life and death.
The city council referred the complaints to the Road and Motorway Directorate, which owns the road, and since it allegedly did not respond, the hole continued to grow.
In the end, the authorities clarified the responsibilities and ownership, and after a month, the Road and Motorway Directorate (ŘSD) began to "intensively deal with the situation".
