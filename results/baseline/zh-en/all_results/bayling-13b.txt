Zhejiang University students perform at the annual academic conference and their research achievements are impressive-Xinhua net
use air to wash hands, detect bad breath to diagnose diseases, and accurately search for the source of haze. Yesterday evening, at the opening ceremony of the 2016 Academic Year of Zhejiang University, a series of outstanding academic achievements were applauded.
The main researchers of these achievements are all students. Their research covers various fields such as environment, mechanics, energy, medicine, life science, humanities education, etc. Their colleagues started from a curious idea, and created many high-end inventions with application value. Some of these projects have won awards at home and abroad.
Bio sensors: Your family doctor in your home
The Ph.D. students of Biomedical Engineering College Zhang Dingming team on the spot exhibited a biological sensor that is only half the size of a smart phone.
Just exhale into the device and it will give you a preliminary health check from the components of your breath.
Zhang Dingming介绍说，这套传感器与智能手机相连，呼出气体后，健康报告就会显示在手机上。
Smart rings that can detect health status in the market generally detect physical parameters such as temperature and pulse.
This biosensor uses a new material called石墨烯. Its target is chemical elements. The sensitive "smell" allows it to reflect the health status of the body more deeply and accurately.
Smart surgical light: doctor's high-powered eyes
In addition to smartphones, smart surgical lamps have also been used in the operating room.
This invention won the silver award at the 44th International Invention Fair in Geneva, Switzerland this year.
Graduate student of Optoelectronic Science and Engineering College of Shenzhen University of Science and Technology, Zhu Linjun and Xie Jianfeng team opened up a new idea and invented an intelligent LED surgical light.
Many cancers are detected too late or not at all, and that is all the fault of the surgeon's lights in the operating theatre.
Jian-Feng Xu said that if the doctor cannot timely see all the tumor organizations at the early detection of cancer, then the cancer cells will spread.
This smart surgical light has four light plates that enhance the contrast of different tissues under light.
During the surgical process, the doctor can adjust the size, brightness, spectrum, color uniformity, and shadowlessness of the light according to the surgical needs and personal habits.
This smart surgery light has been tried and used in some hospitals including the affiliated hospital of Sun Yat-sen University and the affiliated children's hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, and obtained favorable feedback.
Last October, this invention won first prize in the National Challenge Cup.
Use air to wash hands: cool and dazzling
An ordinary person washes their hands by pouring water and scrubbing it with soap, while Li Keqiang and his colleagues invented an “air hand washing device”.
As long as we stand on the hand washing station, our weight will be enough to compress the air.
Like a balloon.
The compressed air forms a fluid at the water nozzle and mixes with water.
This way we can wash our hands properly!
The results of the fluorescent reaction and bacterial retention experiment prove that the effect of washing hands with this method is the same as that of regular handwashing.
This device only needs to rely on our own gravity as the driving force. It can ensure the cleanliness of the washing process and save 90% of water. The entire process is completely energy-free and environmentally friendly.
Last year, at the second Global Grand Challenges Summit, this invention stood out from many world-class universities and won the only gold award.
Please arrange to return it to me as soon as possible, thanks.

Good, thank you.
A meaningful certificate - the first aid certificate.
This is one of the most important skill certificates I have obtained apart from my driver's license!
Here is the English translation:  Note: Emergency measures are actually emergency assistance when sudden events occur, that is, rescue before the ambulance arrives.
It is well known that in the process of ambulance arrival after an accident, in fact, there is still a period of time, and it is precisely this period of time that is crucial.
This is the time for emergency.
If I had really had a heart attack, a stroke and stopped breathing, our window of life would have been four minutes, the golden four minutes!
So, people around you know how important first aid is!
When someone collapses around us, we can try to rescue him through professional knowledge instead of standing there helplessly without doing anything, which is so horrifying.
In China, our official data shows that 3 million people die of sudden cardiac death each year.
Nationally, it's an average of 15 percent.
In the casino hotel in Las Vegas, about 78% can be saved, while in Shanghai and Beijing, less than 1% can be saved."
Lu Rong, the founder of the first reaction, said this.
If someone has a cardiac arrest, is not breathing and has no pulse, punching them is pointless.
CPR and defibrillation are the only ways to save a life.
I found that few people nowadays have this awareness to learn first aid. But when accidents occur, they are inadequate. Therefore, I urge everyone to learn this skill so that we can respond timely when facing emergencies.
You never know, it might just save someone's life!
You can register at the Red Cross Training Center in your local area. I registered at the Red Cross Training Center in Zhuhai. Students can enjoy a discount.
P.S.: The last picture is the record of the goal to be accomplished before 25 years old. Putting the emergency medical certificate into the goal list is also a thing a few months before, but it is really accomplished!
Next, I will apply for other certificates I want to get. I plan to apply for a scuba diving certificate. Previously, I saw a scuba diving emergency certificate on Little Red Book. It seems that I can only take the exam after passing the emergency certificate. So, the emergency certificate is really useful!
I ordered #NUMBER#.
Thirteen yuan for one dumpling!?
No way
How can #NAME# not understand?
One is 13 yuan?
Yesterday, #PRS_ORG# delivered food, and this time they gave me a dumpling!?
Because before I input the code, I saw that it was effective.
First, the conclusion. Personally, I think "Four Seas" is a comprehensive work in all senses.
But if you say this movie is not a bright spot, at least the music selection is good.
There are many ways to make a bad movie, so that you can sleep soundly in the cinema; so that you are angry after watching it; "The Four Seas" to the audience is like a monkey on Mount Tai, it can light your anger in countless ways.
In terms of insulting the audience, Han Han is truly out of this world.
The most painful thing about this piece is that it seems to be a creature in a Kafkaesque novel, indescribable, with many loopholes, just like the windcheater on the body of the little horse.
You'll even question whether there's a director's hidden allegory lurking beneath it all, but on reflection, it's just a pile of poo.
First, let me say a few things that I don't understand.
The male protagonist should live on a small island to the south, relying on his grandmother for life.
Her grandmother wanted to see snow, so the plot arranged for a big grandfather in the neighborhood to take her to see snow in Northeast China.
Old man, sitting on a bread cart, looks at snow from south to north.
Nor was his father relaxed about it.
And then the old man just stopped talking.
How did the female owner's brother obtain the business license for the hotel on a abandoned boat?
Why did the helicopter party have to block the mountain road so easily?
The truck that was carrying steel rods in the middle of the road stopped, and the truck drivers could not find it.
This is too obvious.
Why would an untrustworthy and illegal small drone party become a police assistant?
Why didn't the police report the high interest loan? The police in the movie also specially asked if there was any difficulty.
A grown-up knows how to use a smartphone, but does not know how to use a hotel card to open the door, and then forcibly arranges to find the hotel boss, and sleeps outside the room door?
This kind of inexplicable plot permeates the entire film, and when they are too far-fetched, it makes me feel painful when I recall them.
Apart from the plot, the worst thing about the movie is that it has no purpose, or rather it is a Frankenstein-like patchwork of ideas.
The film begins as if it's going to be a comedy, 20 minutes later it's probably an inspirational drama, halfway through you're not sure if it's a film about a town's young people struggling to survive, by the end you're not sure what you've watched and you're left with deep doubts about why you run to the cinema to watch toilets.
For most people, in fact, it is quite familiar with the plot of various movies. For example, if you want to shoot a movie about a race car driver, you can encourage him + comedy and then tell the audience how an outstanding chef can step by step to success.
If you're making a romcom, you'd better believe we've got a beef between the cute kid from the moped town and the waitress sister.
If you're trying to reflect reality, then the least you can do is not to have things in your plot that contradict with the normal world.
(For example, the new mortal character Yin just played, who was burned to death, and then was able to sing,) cannot avoid some boring brain holes.
As for the female lead who is clearly not smart, she performed like a 5-year-old in some aspects. I really don’t know whether this is due to acting or the director’s requirements.
I don't quite understand why racing driver Han Han is so keen to include car crash scenes in his own movies?
Was this movie schedule arranged during the Spring Festival in order to cater to the audience?

Check the production and processing equipment for well concrete modules. Zhengzhou井壁砖模块设备 introduction:
Zhengzhou Yike is a domestic manufacturer of ready-mixed concrete inspection drilling rigs, excavator-mounted drilling rigs, and masonry drilling rigs. It is a professional manufacturer of production lines ranging from semi-automatic to fully automatic.
After years of practice and development, we now have high-quality products, including liquid pressure, mobile, fully automatic drilling rig series equipment and accessories.
On-site assembly of Zhengzhou井壁砖模块 production and processing equipment:
Examine the characteristics and advantages of Zhengzhou井壁砖模块 production and processing equipment:
Yi Xin checks that the井砌块砖机设备 is widely applicable to new excavation materials for civil underground construction of coal, heat, water, electricity, gas and so on.
For example, various types of inspections such as drainage and storage facilities, wells, rain gutters, swales, compost pits, small structures, bridges, and retaining walls.
The advantage of using precast concrete modules to build inspection wells is that the four sides of each module are concave and convex structures, which are combined with masonry to form a chain link structure.
The resistance of the earthen wall against cutting is far better than that of the rammed earth form.
The module is a hollow structure, and the holes are interconnected both vertically and horizontally after the bricks are laid. After the core is filled, a web-like reinforced concrete structure is formed, which provides secondary reinforcement and waterproofing.
The module is provided with stirrups on both sides, which correspondingly increase the overall strength of the structure.
In addition, the inspection wells and drainage wells made of modular masonry by the drilling rig are not prone to collapsing, sinking, leaking, and other phenomena. The wall and roof modules of the drilling rig are mechanically stable, easy to operate, and have standard sizes.
The concrete inspection drilling rig equipment is equipped with intelligent control and data input/output devices. The entire process of mechanical operation is monitored by a touch-screen liquid crystal display, realizing an ideal human-machine dialogue, automatic analysis of materials, density operation, safety logic control and fault diagnosis system.
The井壁墙体模块机械液压系统 uses a single-cylinder hydraulic pressure system for delivery and a twin-cylinder hydraulic pressure system for delivery.
Independent hydraulic integration station avoids the impact of host vibration on the hydraulic system, thereby ensuring the reliability of the hydraulic system.
The concrete inspection井模块砖机设备布料箱行进模箱脱模上升，储料箱门关闭，自动输送托板，全部由液压系统独立完成，从而达到减少机械的磨损和维修.
The concrete inspection井模块采用的采用进口电脑、电器，密封件液压件，准保设备综合性能稳定可靠。
The modular machine vibration platform of the井壁 adopts integral steel plates, and the cutting lines of the table surface are welded without soldering points, so that the filler box is free to move and fully reduce mechanical wear.
Reduce the load of the mold, integrate the filler and double the encryption amplitude. Adopt integral,同步,台振,模振 to ensure vibration effect.
The vibrating wall module is a mechanical vibration exciter that adjusts the amplitude based on the material price ratio and is automatically controlled by a computer. The amplitude is not damaged, which extends the service life and reduces costs.
井壁墙体模块机械自动控制和手动控制双重功能。

Chongqing Vocational College tries out modern apprentice system on admission of new students-China News Service
Yesterday, reporters learned from the municipal Education Committee that starting this year, our city will pilot the “modern apprentice” talent training mode in 60 vocational schools. Students who participate in the pilot will be trained as apprentices while studying, and will be enrolled as regular employees of the enterprise after they are admitted.
The municipal education committee requires that the recruitment and employment process of vocational schools be regulated, and the dual identity of students as both vocational school students and employees of enterprises be clearly defined. According to the principle of mutual selection, students, schools, and enterprises sign a tripartite agreement. For students under 18 years old who are not yet 16 years old, a quadripartite agreement must be signed by the student, guardian, school, and enterprise to determine the rights and specific positions, teaching content, and rights protection of the student during on-the-job training.
Encourage试点学校采用现代学徒制形式与合作企业联合开展企业员工岗前培训和转岗培训。
The experimental school wants to reform the mode of talent training.
The school and enterprise jointly design the talent training plan, and formulate professional teaching standards, curriculum standards, position standards, enterprise tutor standards, quality monitoring standards and relevant implementation plans.
The pilot program aims to cultivate the educational system. Students determine their internship time in enterprises according to the plan of cultivating talents. Generally, on-the-job training lasts for 6 months.
In enterprise practice, the enterprise team management model should be implemented. According to the different characteristics of the profession, 1 teacher can lead 2-5 students to form a learning group, so that students can master the skills required for each training position.
According to the arrangement, from 2016 to August 2019, our city divided into three batches to determine 60 city-level modern apprentices, with a total of 3000 students (apprentices).
on a trial basis and then promote it. The principle of exploring a long-term mechanism for establishing school-enterprise partnerships, joint training and integration of human resources will be gradually promoted. This will effectively improve the employment skills of students and increase their employment rate and quality.
My app says it's delivered but I haven't received it
Just ordered takeout, don't know if it's at the door
Then call for a replay
I live on the upstream side, why did the order go to the Hangzhou Flower Garden

This vacuum cleaner has been considered for a long time. In the end, it is reluctant to cut grass, and the suction effect is not bad. The indoor dust is significantly less, but it is a bit heavy to hold; the wet cleaning needs to be improved, and there will be dust when it is returned; overall, it is still satisfied.
The food processor is really immersive, looking up at the high ceiling, it is suitable for me, a cooking novice. My child said that it tasted better than what I fried. I have made twice-cooked and double-boiled dishes before, and the sweet and sour pork is especially delicious. It takes a long time, but the other dishes take very little time, and the noise is very small, so you do not have to worry that it will not turn out, nor do you have to worry that it will be too noisy!
Received the goods. Could not wait to cook three dishes. Really, technology has changed life. The control of heat and seasonings of the wok is so precise that the taste of the dish is directly upgraded to the level of a professional chef. It is good. For those who are not good at cooking, this is a great tool. Recommended for purchase!
I have added a new member to the kitchen.
It is an intelligent cooking machine that automatically adjusts the flame and flips over by itself.
We no longer have to be afraid of being scalded by hot oil, and we no longer have to be afraid that the fire is not well-controlled and the dishes are burned or stuck.
The dishes that were cooked were much tastier than what I had made, especially the tomato and egg dish which had a particularly nice flavor and texture.
This pot is worth the price.
Everything is good, worth buying, very good.
Very good, very clear, consistent with the description.
Worth having.
The customer service is also very good.
The screen is large, clear, and does not tire the eyes. No abnormalities have been found so far.
It is thicker than the current mainstream displays. In addition, the bezel is a bit wider, and the seam between the bezel and the screen is a bit large. However, the screen display effect is good, and the accessories are complete.

South African doctor: Oomycete spread is strong but mostly mild
Many doctors and health experts in South Africa believe that the symptoms caused by the new coronavirus are milder than those caused by the Deltavirus, although the spreading speed is faster.
According to the Associated Press, as the spread of the Omega variant in South Africa, a group of more than 5,000 doctors in Johannesburg, South Africa reported that the symptoms of the patients they are currently treating are mild, such as body aches and coughing, similar to flu-like symptoms.
The organization's chief medical officer, Dr. Unben Pillay, said he was seeing dozens of patients each day but none required hospitalization.
They are able to control the illness at home and most people recover within 10 to 14 days, Mr Pelley said.
This includes the elderly and those with underlying health problems who are more prone to severe disease due to COVID-19.
He said in comparison to the first wave of the Deltra fever, the new coronavirus patients he treated "found it difficult to breathe and had low blood oxygen levels.
Many were kept in hospital for several days.
Other doctors have shared similar experiences in the two weeks since the first case of the virus was reported in southern Africa.
Although it will take several weeks to gather enough data, the doctor's observations and early evidence provide some clues.
According to the National Institute of Infectious Diseases in South Africa, among the new coronavirus patients who were hospitalized in the past few weeks, only 30% had severe symptoms, which is half of the proportion of severe cases in the first wave of the epidemic. The average hospitalization time decreased from 8 days to 2.8 days. Among the recent coronavirus patients, only 3% died, while in the early cases in South Africa, the mortality rate reached 20%.
Willem Hanekom, chief of the Africa Health Research Institute, quoted data from the National Institute of Communicable Diseases and other reports to say, "All signs currently point to this being a mild disease."
It's still early, he said. "We need to see the follow-up data."
In normal circumstances, hospitalization and deaths occur later, but we are just two weeks into this outbreak.
At the same time, scientists around the world are observing case numbers and hospitalization rates, and testing the effectiveness of current vaccines and treatment methods.
Despite still being the world's main SARS-CoV-2 virus strain, cases of the disease are appearing in dozens of countries, with South Africa as the epicentre.
According to health officials, a new case in the first week of December saw an increase of 400% in the province, with tests showing that cases of the Omsk variant accounted for more than 90%.
Thanks to today's supporters, all 80 boxes have been sent out!

Educational evaluation: What do we rely on to save abducted children?
If we take the analogy of the famous public interest advertising slogan "Without buying and selling there is no killing", in the environment without "收拐" demand, the mass prevention and control and anti-trafficking make the trafficking act profitless, risky and costly. So this kind of crime will not be repeated.
Recently, the Criminal Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security launched an emergency response platform for missing children developed by the police.
This is an authoritative channel for issuing missing children information and an Internet information platform set up for timely recovery of abducted children.
Upon hearing the name of this App, “Together”, one would immediately feel warm.
The new technology means not only "artistic" and "emotional", but also informatized and practical and effective.
The primary goal of law enforcement is to find the abducted child and protect their physical safety and freedom.
The second is the trial and punishment of the suspects.
The significance of criminal punishment, ranging from individual punishment to social prevention and legal education, can be expressed in many "big words".
But the top priority should be given to the personal safety of the victim before the breakthrough of the criminal case.
Major topics such as "whether child trafficking should be punished by death" and so on can be temporarily shelved and discussed carefully; but helping trafficked children is imperative.
According to the investigation experience of such cases, human traffickers are accustomed to quickly leave the scene after committing the crime.
The longer the search takes, the further the child may be from the parent, making the case more difficult to solve.
In this case, taking out a direct help like "B��圆" platform is indeed a pragmatic action and effective way to solve the case and find back the children.
After all, "changing course" is a major task that requires the operation of the entire legal system.
Combating crime, protecting the rights of children and parents, from improving legislation to safeguarding justice and law enforcement, all require the implementation of "care for the young and weak".
In addition, the prevention of child trafficking, from families to society, can be further improved.
For example, a common case is that a family of three were resting at the train station, and when they woke up, they found that their child was missing.
We cannot expect a two-year-old child to have sufficient self-protection skills, but as a parent of young children, we should at least have some awareness of protection.
Parents taking turns to rest and placing their children in safe protection are the most effective methods to prevent children from being abducted.
From another perspective of the police cracking down on child trafficking, those who buy these children should also be monitored and punished.
A single act of illegality is often only a link in a long chain.
According to the provisions of China's Criminal Law, the statutory penalty for trafficking children is 5 years' imprisonment. In cases where the circumstances are particularly serious, the sentence may be up to death with confiscation of property.
The crime of trafficking children is obviously a crime of heavier punishment in the trend of "lightening punishment".
To this day, there are still many cases of trafficking every year.
It can be seen that some people's views on raising children are lagging behind, and their legal awareness is weak.
Legal education should be synchronized for this group of people.
To effectively control trafficking crimes, we cannot rely solely on strict law enforcement by the authorities.
If the “markets” are widespread, the sellers will be greedy and constantly innovate in their selling methods, leading to a “battle” situation with law enforcers. The sellers’ actions will inevitably become inefficient.
Therefore, eradicating outdated concepts, promoting legal consciousness, can also help eliminate trafficking and buying of children.
Yang Jiechi delivers a speech on behalf of the 19th CPC National Congress and the Provincial Party Congress spirit
and push forward the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.
Hunan Daily December 10 news (Reporter: Fang Bo) In accordance with the unified arrangement of the Provincial Party Committee, on the morning of December 10, Provincial Party Committee Standing Committee, Provincial Party Committee Propaganda Department Minister Yang Hongdao went to the video park in Maonanshan to deliver an interactive lecture, in-depth study and implement the spirit of the 19th CPC National Congress, study and implement the spirit of Xi Jinping’s important speeches and instructions, and study and implement the spirit of the 12th Provincial Congress.
Yang Jiechi, from the ideal and belief, the initial mission, the self-revolution and the youthfulness of the Party, the leaders and the theories of the Party, combined his own realization and his personal experience, and explained comprehensively and systematically the core essence and the practical requirements of the spirit of the 19th CPC National Congress.
He pointed out that we should integrate the essence of the 1st National Congress of the CPC and the important instructions given by General Secretary Xi Jinping in his important speech in Lake Dongting into the study and practice of the Provincial Party Committee, so as to strengthen the thought of “upholding the two safeguards” and “carrying out the two safeguards” and enhance self-consciousness, political consciousness and sense of responsibility, and unswervingly move forward in the direction indicated by General Secretary Xi Jinping.
At the interactive exchange segment, grassroots party branch representatives, enterprise representatives and youth representatives asked questions about the relationship between the three historical resolutions, how to understand the decisive significance of “two establishments”, how cultural enterprises can grasp the orientation, how young people in the new era can draw strength from the history of the Party and so on. Yang Jiechi answered the questions in a plain-spoken language and with vivid examples. He advised young Party members to draw strength from the history of the Party’s struggle and unite closely around the CPC Central Committee, unswervingly follow the Party and use the book of youth dedication and responsibility to write a responsible society.

In fact, it was not the shop that was at fault, but the courier.
There is no invoice in the bag.
Could not be found.

Yes, we've got a rider
He's waited long enough.

The International Olive Oil Council divides olive oil into two categories and five grades: virgin olive oil and refined olive oil.
Cold-pressed olive oil, also known as extra virgin olive oil, is obtained from the fresh olive fruit by mechanical extraction and filtering to remove impurities.
According to acidity, there are three levels:
Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO): is the highest quality and quantity of olive oil, it is a pure natural product.
The taste is excellent, with a gentle and pleasant plant fragrance, and the acidity does not exceed 1%.
High Quality Extra Virgin Olive Oil (Fine Virgin): The acidity is slightly higher but does not exceed 2%, with a pure and fragrant taste.
Extra Virgin Olive Oil (Ordinary Virgin): The taste and aroma are still present, and the acidity does not exceed 3.3%.
The extraction of olive oil refers to the olive oil obtained after the initial pressing of olive oil with a acidity level exceeding 3.3%, or it is called "second oil".
Olive oil can be divided into two levels:
Common olive oil (Olive Oil): a mixture of refined olive oil and a certain proportion of freshly pressed olive oil, to adjust the taste and color, with an acidity of 1.5% or less, it is a transparent light yellow color.
Refined Olive-Pomace Oil: is obtained by extracting and refining olive oil from the residue.
If you have watched the classification, you should have already discovered that the acidity of olive oil is an extremely important indicator.
You should know that olive oil is like wine made from grapes. Olive oil from different production areas and different olive varieties will produce oil of different standards.
The best place to grow olive trees:
The Mediterranean coast has the most suitable climate conditions for olive trees to grow, including soil and temperature, sunshine, air humidity, and rainfall.
除了地中海沿岸外，其他地区只能在适宜的区域零星种植。
主要产区产地（地中海）：
Italy, Spain, Greece, Turkey, Portugal, Morocco, Syria, Israel, Tunisia, Algeria, Egypt, Pakistan, Lebanon, and other countries with similar climates are also found in the southern hemisphere, such as Argentina, Peru, South Africa, etc.
The olive harvesting season:
From 3 to 6 June every year is the time for olive trees to bloom and fruit, and from 7 to 10 October the fruit begins to develop and ripen, transitioning from green to red, purple, and finally black.
From November to the following February is the real harvest season (the freshness of the olive oil is very important).
The nutritional composition of olive oil:
Olive oil is rich in monounsaturated fats, including oleic acid and palmitoleic acid, as well as vitamins A, B, D, E, K, and antioxidants.
Olive oil is considered the most suitable oil for human nutrition among all the fats discovered so far.
Democratic Summit ends, Biden says the flame of freedom will never be extinguished
The online "Summit for Democracy" concluded on Friday (December 10) with the attendance of leaders from 110 countries, government officials, civil society and private sector leaders called by US President Donald Trump.
Biden said in his closing remarks that the flame of freedom burns in every person's heart, and authoritarian regimes will never extinguish it.
He also said that plans are underway to hold the second global "Democracy Summit" next year.
Taiwan government representative, Political Affairs Committee member Tang Feng and Hong Kong democracy activist Roy Cheung, who is now in exile in the UK, also spoke at the summit on the second day.
We know how difficult the work is that lies before us, Biden said.
But we also know that we can face challenges because, as I have said before, democracy is all around us.
"An authoritarian regime can never extinguish the flame of freedom, which burns in the hearts of people around the world."
Biden also stated that defending democracy requires the collective effort of the entire society.
He said: "As leaders of this government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, to strengthen the bulwarks of democracy, to drive reform, to achieve transparent accountability, to resist more effectively the forces of authoritarianism and incumbency, and those who seek power before the public interest."
The themes of the second day of the “Democracy Summit” are respectively defending human rights, consolidating democracy and resisting authoritarianism, as well as countering digital authoritarianism and affirming democratic values.
on the International Human Rights Day.
UN Secretary-General António Guterres also said in his opening speech on the same day that the cause of democracy is facing challenges, especially those brought by new digital technologies.
It's time now to reaffirm our shared values and positions and our democratic resilience, he said.
This requires deepening social dialogue, addressing inequality, combating corruption, updating social contracts, investing in quality education, and expanding opportunities for women and girls.
This also requires a firm condemnation of all forms of populism, nationalism, and extremism, including the use of all tools provided by the technological revolution.
Hong Kong democracy activist Ronny Tong delivered a speech at the summit through a pre-recorded video, reminding participants to continue to pay attention to the human rights situation of ethnic minorities such as the Uygurs and Tibetans in China.
He said: "For a long time, the world has been tolerating China's rise without establishing a mechanism to hold it accountable.
This is why political figures and civil society leaders must collaborate.
"We must use all that we have (resources) to ensure the revival of democracy is our top priority."
Ron DeSantis also called on the free world to unite against the threat of communism.
He said: "Maybe some of you are afraid of irritating General Secretary Xi Jinping, maybe some of you don't want to lose the Chinese market, maybe some of you have not realised (the threat of the Communist Party) to our democratic values."
And that's why we failed.
This is another reason why we must change.
Taiwan's Executive Yuan Secretary-General Tang Feng attended the roundtable discussion on "Combating Digital Authoritarianism and Upholding Democratic Values" and released the "National Statement" via video, emphasizing that Taiwan is at the forefront of combating authoritarianism and power.
He also shared how to combat the COVID-19 pandemic through information transparency and building trust.
"At a time when Taiwan's democracy is in its infancy, we have always stood at the forefront of the global fight against authoritarianism, playing a leadership role in promoting global freedom, democracy, and human rights."
During the pandemic, authoritarian governments around the world, in the name of public health and collective interest, have rationalized human rights violations, which is a sign of global democracy in retreat.
However, in Taiwan, we do not have to besiege the city to control the epidemic, nor do we have to lower the flag to fight false information."
At the same time as the schedule for the “Democracy Summit”, the US Treasury Department announced sanctions against 15 individuals and 10 entities from China, North Korea and several other countries that have been recognized as having seriously violated human rights, and imposed investment restrictions on a Chinese company that has been recognized as having used surveillance technology to assist in the violation of human rights.

I know.
But the restaurant doesn't know why delivery times are continually being pushed back
Originally, there were #NUMBER#.
Well, I didn't
Not eaten.
I will definitely complain.
You can't send it, why don't you say it early
For so long
No, I did not receive a call.
Please notify him to send it to our company again.
I don't want to wait #NUMBER# minutes.
A meal takes half an hour
None of #PRS_ORG# has arrived yet.
I want to cancel the order.
Why not cancel
Hello, the chicken from the restaurant is live.
Want to try tennis but fear that I may not persevere, so I want to find a slightly expensive trainer first.
It is not friendly, in fact, the price is often inversely proportional to the degree of friendliness. If you cannot distinguish, then the expensive normal shot is more friendly than the affordable one. Such "entrance shots" are actually industrial waste.
Their strength is very weak, the ball just hit the palm, the vibration is very large, the hardball cannot be held, and the high hand is very difficult to control.
The logic and subtext behind their words are - tennis is so hard, you know you can't learn, we know you can't bear to buy expensive things, so we'll sell you cheap stuff that will mess you up, you'll play twice and won't want to play anymore, so this shot is cheap, and you won't mind.
If you can really tell the difference, it means you have made progress. Wait until you have the money and come here to buy the expensive ones.
Spend similar money to buy a second-hand racquet, choose Prince or Dunlop, as these two brands are not well-known, so good racquets are also not expensive. A new racquet priced at 500 or 600 yuan is quite all right, while a second-hand racquet priced at 200 yuan for a thousand yuan is not so great.
Very friendly to beginners, but after the beginner’s stage, it becomes very difficult, but most people, especially girls, cannot pass the beginner’s stage.
The delivery time has been repeatedly postponed.
Can you help me follow up?
Delay
Thank you.
So essentially I already have credit?
Do I need to reorder? Originally, that order wasn't necessary, was it?
Hello, I ordered food from this restaurant, but when it arrived, there was a lot missing and the chicken was live.
#PRS_ORG# I have no connection with the organization. Please cancel.
My order is for delivery, completely not for self-collection.

In fact, dressing is very important for chubby girls.
For chubby girls, the skirt cannot be too short or too long, with a length just above the knee, it can cover the thighs well.
If the skirt is too short, it will reveal the fat legs.
Too long will give people a feeling of being short and chubby.
If the waist, skirt and long sleeves are in different colors, it will produce an elongating effect.
In fact, many dark-colored clothes are appropriate for chubby girls (something the author can relate to), dark colors can also hide your body shape, and the elegant black short skirt is also the first choice for chubby girls.
Wearing dark clothing, especially a short black skirt, will make a person appear thinner.
If you have chubby legs, avoid wearing tight socks and shoes that draw attention to your legs.
The greater the popularization, the less colorful it should be.
So as not to make people feel your legs and feet are fat.
We must talk about the tips for dressing and matching for a slightly chubby girl.
Chubby girls should avoid tight skirts at all costs. Apart from that, blouses should not be too short or stuffed into the skirts, which would make people feel uncomfortable. If your legs are thick, choose dark coloured long socks or netted socks (the kind with a fine mesh); select a soft printed dress with a floral design, and team it with a collared blouse. This can effectively camouflage the chubby girl's shortcomings.
Of course, chubby girls in short skirts are also worth talking about.
If you are an overweight girl wearing a short skirt, you should choose a top that is the same color as the short skirt. This will have the effect of enhancing your body shape.
A short skirt paired with high heels can make your legs appear longer, which is the most IN combination for summer!
If you are top-heavy but have slim legs, choose a glamorous knee-length dress.
It will not only cover your big belly but also show your advantage.
A-line skirts will show more slimming effect. They are more suitable for chubby girls. The top should choose body-hugging type to form layered feeling.
A simple white T-shirt and short skirt are also good choices for plumpers.
Even chubby girls can look stylish.
If you can master the art of dressing and matching, even chubby girls will be the focus of public attention.
After the change in dressing and matching, we should exercise more in life and try to get rid of the label of being chubby as soon as possible 😄

Girl donates kidney to sister: "It's alright even if I die" - Xinhua
A girl stands in front of a large wooden board at Wulin Square in Hangzhou, with the words "Human flesh target, 10 yuan per arrow" written on it.
Yesterday morning, a photo of a "Hangzhou girl's generous donation" went viral among friends.
The photo shows that in Hangzhou Wulin Square, a girl stands in front of a raised wooden board with the words "Human flesh target, 10 yuan one arrow" written on it, indicating that after paying, pedestrians can shoot arrows.
This has caused a buzz among netizens.
Last night, the spokesperson of the down-town branch of the Hangzhou police station confirmed to the reporter of the Beijing News that the police confirmed that the girl is the sister of the donor, but such behavior is not worth promoting. After the warning, the girl has been away from the local police station.
Girl, 11, targeted by fundraisers on street
According to the online rumor, a long-haired girl in the photo is standing in front of a large wood board on which “人肉靶子，十元一箭” is written in black ink. Her bank account, WeChat and Alipay account are written on another wood board in front of her.
The picture sparked controversy after it was posted online.
Many netizens thought that this was a "self-deprecating behavior", and many netizens expressed sympathy for it.
We discovered the situation around 10 a.m. on the 23rd when we arrived at the square. At that time, the crowd had thinned out.
According to local media interviewed by the police at the scene, the two girls, aged around 20, were stalls. They were dressed up beautifully.
In particular, the girl who acted as the "human target" was crying, and passers-by played this game with her. The other girl stood by and helped her drink, saying her friend's sister had leukemia and urgently needed an operation, please help.
We contacted the local police in Guizhou and learned that the girl was raising funds for her sister's leukemia treatment.
Last night, the propaganda responsible person of Hangzhou City Public Security Bureau downtown branch told the reporter of the Beijing News that the girl, named Jiayi, was the donor.
But he did not have the money to pay for the treatment, so he did something desperate.
He said that throughout the entire process, one of the girls served as the trigger person, but did not participate, and throughout the entire process, no one fired arrows, only that someone watched and took photos, which were then posted on Weibo.
The police later determined that the crossbow used did not fall under regulatory scope.
The person in charge said, "It does not advocate this way of collecting donations."
After being warned by the consulate staff, she had already left the consulate.
Heat dissipation effect: Good. Weight: Convenient. Appearance material: Satisfied. Montblanc has always had a high price-performance ratio.

Personally, I think Huawei P30 Pro is really good. Game effect: The game effect is comfortable, and most games can be played. My frame rate is very high, and it is very smooth. LOL is definitely not a problem, and CSgo is also easily superior. Most third-party games can be played.
Cooling effect: The cooling effect is not bad, and the fan is quite powerful. The working noise is quite quiet, and the gaming effect is fully opened when the fan is not small.
Appearance material: The appearance is very cool, the display effect: the screen is very clear, playing games 1080 is enough
Buying a notebook feels really good. It is mainly used for design. The cost performance is very high. It is lighter than the one in my imagination, and prettier than the one in my imagination. The red on the buttocks is a very good color of wine. It is not so flashy. Overall, it is much more valuable than expected. It is a worthwhile purchase. It is suitable for girls.
Two years ago, I began to contact Hefei night knights. After two years, the sex ratio is relatively high, but the quality is too hard!

He wanted to buy foreign exchange for 418 bank activities, but he urgently needed it, so he bought it in advance. As a result, he did not participate in the bank's large-scale activities, which is a bit regrettable.

He said it was a good buy for his son.
The computer is very good, especially the customer service attitude is very good, even if you do not understand the question, it is recommended to buy.
And it's not bad, the graphics of playing games are really charming.
What's hot in 2021?
Undoubtedly, the Tokyo Olympics.
Do you think only Olympians can win?
Recently, an article titled “Quick Look! The Olympian Project Manager’s Gold-Winning Experience” was very popular. The article mentioned that project managers in many projects can absolutely win the first place, and no one can compete with them. The daily work of project managers includes moving bricks, going on business trips, and staying up all night, while putting out fires, carrying pots, and apologizing are not even worth mentioning.
What seems to be a humorous article also reveals the daily hard work of project managers, behind which lies a lack of enthusiasm for the current project management work.
And personnel involved in project management are also gradually choosing to take action to get rid of the workplace dilemma.
From the number of registered PMPs (project management professionals certified internationally), it can be seen that more and more project management practitioners are learning to enhance their project management capabilities.
According to the "20th Anniversary Report on the Development of Project Management in China (1999-2019)" : As of September 2019, the accumulated number of PMP® examinations nationwide was close to 600,000, with approximately 420,000 PMP® certifications and about 300,000 effective certifications, accounting for 31.2% of the total PMP® certifications worldwide.
The number of PMP certified persons has increased year by year in the last 10 years. This shows that more and more project managers realize that relying on past "experience" to do things is no longer possible. The rapidly changing work environment makes us know that we must learn to stand on the shoulders of scientific giants to explore the road ahead.
However, after taking the PMP exam, can we ensure smooth project management work without obstacles?
Many project management beginners indicate that through learning relevant courses such as PMP/IPMP, they can systematically master relevant knowledge points such as the ten domains and five process groups of project management. However, when they actually engage in project management work, they still feel lost.
Many project managers often feedback the following issues: project management cognition is out of place, relying solely on personal experience, there is no project management theory, not knowing how to practice; lack of systematic project management process support, unable to operate in the work, project estimates are inaccurate, control sensitivity is poor, the project is dragged on; member responsibilities are not clear, the "old guard" in the team does not know how to deal with cross-departmental assistance communication is not smooth, the project is difficult to promote ...
Therefore, it has helped many outstanding enterprises cultivate a large number of product managers and project managers and other key R&D talents, and has won such honorary titles as "China Enterprise R&D Talent Training Model Demonstration Base" with the help of "China Summer Consulting".
"Online Course for Training Project Managers" is a fragmented learning method that combines real-life case studies, tools, and methods of numerous R&D enterprises, helping you master the essential knowledge and standard actions of a project manager, and embark on the path of advanced project management.
This is also an opportunity for enterprises to promote the cultivation process of project managers with lower costs and less investment, and bring efficient operating results to the enterprise.
Just take a look at how other students evaluate this course: This course is not only taught by a team of experts from Zhongtianhua, but also integrates international advanced project management methodology and numerous real business scenarios from well-known enterprises. The course provides a professional and easy-to-understand explanation of the content.
It will provide scientific and practical management tools and methods, as well as rich template forms to help students apply what they learned to their specific work after class.

Just before the “Double Twelves” shopping carnival, consumer advocacy group call for rational consumption - Economic Observer - professional finance and economics news website
This year’s “Singles’ Day” online payment transaction amounted to RMB177.7 billion, setting a new record.
The dazzlingly diverse red envelopes and eye-catching live shopping programs have once again helped consumers reap benefits. This shopping boom on one hand made people marvel at the strengthening national consumption, on the other hand, we must calmly think about the impact of consumerism on society and the contemporary mainstream consumers.
On the eve of “Singles’ Day”, Credit Suisse Financial Services (hereinafter referred to “Credit Suisse”) issued a rational consumption advocacy, reminding the general public, especially young people, to establish good consumption awareness and habits, and to reject blind consumption and excessive consumption.
The results of the "Consumer Financial Literacy Survey and Analysis Report" released by the People's Bank this year showed that the national consumer financial literacy index was 66.81, an increase of 2.04 over 2019.
Overall, Chinese residents have performed well in financial consumption, but there are significant differences in financial behavior and skills, which requires further improvement in basic financial knowledge.
老年人和青少年的金融素养水平相对较低，“一老一少”仍将是金融教育持续关注的重点对象；尼尔森发布的《中国年轻人负债状况报告》及央视财经发布的《2019-2020中国青年消费报告》显示，年轻一代具有巨大的消费潜力，信
As a licensed consumer finance institution, Credit Suisse has always been committed to helping people build their own happy lives with high-quality and caring services, advocating for consumers to establish good and correct consumption habits, and actively responding to regulatory calls to enhance consumers' rational consumption awareness, especially among young people.
In the past few years, Credit Suisse has continuously carried out comprehensive and diversified financial knowledge dissemination activities targeting young people, including college students, and through various forms such as launching innovative practice competitions in collaboration with domestic top universities, helping them rationally guide their consumption demands, so as to help them establish rational consumption concepts, plan their consumption demands, and accumulate wealth.
On the occasion of the Double Twelves, WeChat reminds all consumer friends to establish reasonable consumption awareness and correct money views, resist blind consumption and excessive consumption, avoid consumption and borrowing mistakes, so as not to affect personal credit and future economic life.
Consumers must plan ahead and make every effort to repay debt on time.
If overdue, the overdue record will be recorded in the personal credit report, which may have a negative impact on future car buying, housing and other economic life.
At the same time, when enjoying financial products and services, it is also necessary to choose regular institutions and channels, and pay attention to whether the relevant institutions have operating qualifications.
In the future, WeChat will use its mature and reliable consumer finance system and continuously updated financial products to provide consumers with more personalized and diversified services, constantly help the public improve their financial knowledge, help consumers cultivate the concept of rational consumption and moderate borrowing, and become a reliable consumer finance partner for life.
I won't go.

You thought this was my first call for takeout?
Survey completed, you said the same thing! I checked the address several times before placing the order.
Thank you! How many days is it?
Vietnam People's News Agency - Gulf Cooperation Council should respond to common challenges
The stopovers of King Salman include Amman, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, Bahrain and Kuwait.
It is worth noting that this is the first visit to Qatar by Mohammed bin Salman since the Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies imposed a blockade on Qatar in 2017, which led to a diplomatic crisis in the Gulf.
In this crisis, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Egypt cut off diplomatic relations with Qatar and imposed comprehensive sanctions, accusing Qatar of supporting terrorist organizations and having close ties with Iran.
The diplomatic tension has seriously affected the internal unity of the Gulf Cooperation Council and has had a negative impact on the economy of the region.
Four Arab countries have blockaded the land and sea routes to Qatar.
The crisis was only resolved at the Gulf Cooperation Council summit in January 2021, when all Gulf countries signed an agreement mediated by the United States and Kuwait to move towards "unity and stability."
Saudi Arabia has reopened its border with Qatar.
Saudi Arabia and Egypt are making efforts to restore relations with Qatar through their newly appointed ambassadors in Doha.
The resolution of the Gulf Arab states to resolve their differences and restore relations with Qatar is driven by the requirement to unite in the face of common challenges for the benefit of all countries and regional stability.
During the Saudi King's visit to Oman, both sides agreed to open the first direct land route between the two Gulf countries.
The 725-kilometer-long corridor connecting the two countries will provide convenient conditions for the travel of citizens and the integration of supply chains of the two countries.
Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) will invest $5 billion in Amman and the two countries' companies signed 13 memorandums of understanding worth $30 billion.
The Saudi king's visit to Gulf countries comes as Iran and world powers are trying to salvage the 2015 nuclear deal known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) - a deal negotiated with Gulf Arab states who had complained that they could not resolve issues with Iran's missile program.
All Gulf countries have always regarded Iran as a long-term "competitor" and view Iran's nuclear program as a "threat" to regional security.
All Gulf countries believe that not addressing the Iranian missile issue and not taking action to contain Iran's activities in the region is flawed.
With the failure of major countries to meet the wishes of the Gulf countries in the nuclear negotiations with Iran, Saudi Arabia and Iran held direct negotiations.
Its goal is to prevent the escalation of tension in the region.
This is one of the factors that contribute to the slowdown of economic growth in the Gulf Cooperation Council countries.
The upcoming Gulf Cooperation Council summit will be the first summit of Gulf Cooperation Council countries since the dispute between some member states and Qatar ended.
This is an opportunity for the Gulf Cooperation Council to reassess its contributions to promoting the restoration of Gulf unity, and to propose various measures to enable its member states to fully cooperate in addressing common challenges and contributing to the stability and development of Gulf countries.

The new mountain district ultra-marathon is the loudest!
This time our team has brought a car that many men dream of!
It is the flagship super sports car of Lamborghini - the Murcielago's successor, the Aventador LP700-4!
The price is close to 2 million yuan, the annual road tax is several thousand yuan, four-wheel drive, why is it called LP700?
Because it has 700 horsepower, can you imagine just how fast it is?
Even I don’t know, according to data, it takes only 2.9 seconds to accelerate from 0-100km/h. So, it would take myvi about 30 seconds to reach 30km/h, haha.
The low-slung body, the exaggerated scissor doors, the enormous air intakes around the car and the glass-topped 6.5 V12 engine perfectly illustrate Lamborghini's style.
No need to say too much about the car. You can find it on Google. We have compiled some explanations that Google may not have given!
Too eye-catching, everywhere you go, everyone is looking, very embarrassing! (Actually quite funny)
RM1 is around 1km petrol money (owner does not care)
You need to practice getting in and out of the car a few times, otherwise it'll be a bit embarrassing (because you won't be able to climb into the car cabin and then get stuck halfway).
The engine noise was too great, and it was deafening after getting out of the car (but it was still very cool).
The car body is too big, and it is too narrow to stop at a normal parking space. I am afraid to be knocked by the pillar when the door is opened!
A bit lonely as there was no-one to overtake (just me talking to myself, haha)
Don't be fooled, this video isn't for sale, sorry!
If you want to make a video for your beloved car, please contact us!

Align the university spirit with the spirit of the times - Xinhua network
The so-called university spirit refers to a series of academic ideas and values that a university accumulates over a long period of development, which is the soul of the university.
Since ancient times until now, the university spirit has been crucial for the development of politics, economy, culture, technology, society, and even the progress of a nation.
Emerging from the world's first modern university, colleges and universities have borne unique missions that are different from those of other social organizations. For Chinese colleges and universities, this began during a time of national crisis, and its spirit is deeply influenced by traditional culture and changes in the times. They advocate the values of "benefiting mankind, purifying the world" and the patriotic responsibility of "promoting learning to strengthen the nation".
At present, the trends of informatization and internationalization in higher education are increasingly prominent. Education competition, scientific and technological competition, and talent competition are intensifying globally, and higher education as an important "supply side" is facing unprecedented opportunities and challenges in its structural reform.
In particular, the proposal of "Overall Plan for Advancing World-Class Universities and Disciplines" has set higher requirements for university development while demonstrating the confidence and determination of our country in moving from a high-education power to a high-education powerhouse.
How can we strive to enter the world’s top rankings in a short period of time, and accelerate the establishment of several world-class universities and a number of world-class disciplines on the basis of a certain gap?
In addition to firm goal confidence, path confidence, and ability confidence, colleges and universities should also fully utilize their three advantages: the first is the follow-up advantage, through continuous introduction of outstanding overseas academic talents and learning from the advanced experiences of world-class universities, achieving remarkable improvement in academic level and teaching quality; the second is the cultural advantage, inheriting the wisdom of Chinese civilization accumulated over 5,000 years and promoting excellent traditional Chinese culture, thereby gathering strength, shaping the brand, and improving the image; the third is the institutional advantage, leveraging the institutional superiority of a socialist country, strengthening goal-driven,
It should be noted that building world-class universities is not a one-size-fits-all approach. Each school must highlight its strengths and characteristics.
In addition to having common Chinese characteristics, it should also reflect the unique goals and target positioning, educational traditions, and resource endowment of each institution of higher learning.
For Zhejiang University, we focus on highlighting three characteristics in our education: the first is to emphasize the cultivation of innovative and entrepreneurial talents, to build an integrated person training environment that combines science and technology and school-enterprise, and form a complete chain of entrepreneurial education ecosystem; the second is to emphasize the characteristics of interdisciplinary integration, to promote the optimization and adjustment of the disciplinary system, and to create an institutional environment of interdisciplinary integration, actively cultivating new interdisciplinary and signature interdisciplinary achievements; the third is to emphasize the characteristics of educational and social services, to carry out in
In this process, it is particularly important to always adhere to the university spirit and make the university spirit resonate with the times.
For Zhejiang University, the “Seeking Truth and Innovation” school motto, “Diligence, morality, clarity of mind, and adherence to principles” shared values, as well as “Embrace the world, pursue truth, work for the people” and “Plant trees for our country” jointly constitute the latest expression of the Zhejiang spirit.
This is an important guarantee for schools to adhere to the correct direction of study and continue to accumulate cultural height and gather spiritual strength. It is rich in connotation and far-reaching in meaning.
Among them, "Yangtze River Delta" emphasizes the spirit of openness and inclusiveness, which is reflected in the chest-beating of "the world's talents are for me to use". It means to draw on the excellent ideas of world-renowned institutions of higher learning. "Seeking Truth and Goodness" emphasized by "Qixue" refers to the pursuit of truth and goodness. It means that while universities pursue truth, they should also accept the molding and tempering of morality and personality. "Open up a new world" embodies the reform and innovation spirit, which includes both the pursuit of knowledge and the
It is the soul of the 120-year-old Zhejiang University.
The wise listen in silence, the intelligent see what is not yet formed.
As China's higher education institutions further step into the general situation of socialism with Chinese characteristics, they should deeply understand the times and historical missions of higher education and accelerate the process of building world-class universities.
At the same time, adhering to humanistic care and independence, let the university spirit and the spirit of the times, and the national spirit resonate with each other, so as to provide endless momentum for achieving national prosperity and revitalizing the nation, and realizing the common ideal of human beings.

Just as NFTs were taking off, the crypto community introduced a new concept.
In 2021, a blockchain game called "Axie Infinity" had a huge impact in Southeast Asia. Some residents who lost their jobs due to the pandemic began to obtain stable income from this game.
Axie Infinity is a pet-rearing game that is based on blockchain technology. It combines various play methods, including NFTs. It is currently the NFT project with the highest transaction volume, having exceeded US$3 billion.
TokenTerminal data shows that Axie Infinity’s daily revenue exceeded $8.2 million, close to “Honor of Kings”.
On August 6 this year, Axie Infinity officially claimed that its daily active users exceeded one million.
The popularity of Axie Infinity will pass on a new "palytoearn" model to more people. With the help of blockchain and smart contracts, players are no longer a single character. In addition to being able to obtain fun and economic benefits from the game, players can also participate in the governance of the game ecology.
This kind of subjectivity is not conferred by game developers, but is guaranteed by blockchain technology.
When I saw the news about my friend’s stock, my biggest feeling was the company’s choice, that is, the choice of investment target industry. The first is to choose an industry with large growth space, with a market size of at least RMB100 billion; secondly, to choose an industry with good growth prospects for the next 3-5 years; finally, to choose an industry with policy support.
The width of the racecourse refers to the market size, the length of the racecourse refers to the industry's development stage, and whether the racecourse is flat or rugged refers to the industry's competitive landscape.

The first thing in the new year is to summarize the 2021 and adjust the 2022 strategic layout.
Tactics is "doing the right things", that is, doing things right.
The strategy is to "do the right thing," which means to do the right thing.
Tactics is about finding a direction, strategy is about making a landing. In most tactical thinking, there is space for strategic thinking.
For example, how to increase the number of customers (tactical thinking) can be considered as whether to continue deepening in the current field or expand horizontally to other fields (strategic thinking); for example, how to improve customer retention rate (tactical thinking) can be considered as how to improve the retention rate of core and high-value customers (strategic thinking); in terms of improving activity participation rate (tactical thinking), it can be considered as how to set up appropriate activity KPIs and achieve the correct activity goals, such as improving target customer participation degree, activating high-value silent customers, and precision reactivation. In terms of improving DAU (tactical thinking), it can be considered as whether the current growth is healthy and sustainable.
Twelve years after its inception, Bitcoin celebrated several milestones in 2021.
On September 7, El Salvador, a small country in Central America, declared Bitcoin as a legal currency, which is the first time for Bitcoin to become a legal currency of a country or region.
On October 12, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved ProShares to list its Bitcoin ETF on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), marking the first time the SEC has approved a Bitcoin ETF. This means that the first compliant Bitcoin futures ETF has landed in the US capital market, expanding the scope of Bitcoin investment.
From the perspective of blockchain technology development, Bitcoin is not the main character.
On November 14, 2021, Bitcoin underwent a soft fork upgrade called "Taproot", which improved the anonymity of transactions on the Bitcoin network and reduced data burden in transactions by changing the data structure of the blocks themselves.

Overseas Chinese group complains of discrimination by Yuru and three other well-known springboard schools - Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency Washington May 23 wire (Reporter: Xu Jianmei) On the 23rd, more than 130 Asian groups submitted a protest to the US Department of Education and the Department of Justice against the discrimination of Asian students in the admission process of the three prestigious schools - Yale University, Brown University and Dartmouth College.
The Asian Education Alliance, which filed the lawsuit, held a news conference in Washington that day.
At the press conference, the chairman of the group, Zhao Yuankun, said that over the past 10 years, the number of Asian applicants who meet the conditions of American schools has doubled, but the proportion of Asians in these three American schools is basically maintained at the same level.
Many studies have shown that in the so-called "holistic" admissions process, these universities "systematically and continuously discriminate against Asian-American applicants."
According to Zhao Yukun, in 2014, research by Sanders and other scholars showed that in these three institutions of higher learning, the admission rate for ethnic Chinese was the lowest among all ethnic groups.
Data from the US Department of Education also shows that among all members of the Ivy League, Brown University and Dartmouth College have the lowest admission rates for Asian students, and Yale University and Brown University have effectively implemented racial quotas for Asian applicants for more than 20 years.
Zhao Yuanku told Xinhua News Agency reporters that they hoped that after submitting the complaint, the US Department of Education and the Department of Justice could launch investigations and take measures to prevent these colleges from continuing to discriminate against Asian students after the determination of facts.
They also hope that the higher education institutions can actively pay attention to this issue and change their admission policies for Asian students.
None of the three universities named in the complaint has responded yet.
Founded in 2001, the Asian American Education Alliance had once complained about Harvard University's admission discrimination, but the US Department of Education did not accept the application.
In addition to the Chinese American group, the complaint also includes American Indian, Korean, Japanese, and Pakistani American educational groups.

In September 2020, Mr. Lu from the real estate agency learned about a factory building located in Yuyao, Zhejiang Province. After multiple on-site visits, Mr. Lu decided to purchase the factory building.
In December of the same year, after Landlord Lin had negotiated with the owner of the house, he transferred 200,000 yuan as a deposit via bank transfer on the same day.
Lin signed as the buyer on the “Factory Sale and Purchase Agreement”, which stated that “if the buyer does not want to buy this factory, the deposit will be returned to the seller. If the seller does not want to sell this factory, double deposit will be returned to the seller. Both parties agree to sign the sale and purchase contract within one week.
However, subsequently, both parties failed to reach a consensus on the main provisions of the contract, such as the scope of factory buildings and payment methods, resulting in the failure to sign the house purchase and sale contract.
As both parties failed to reach a consensus on the content of the contract, a few days later, Lin returned 200,000 yuan of the deposit to Luo.
The house was so hard to miss, the deposit had been paid, the mortgage was ready, and we were just one signature away from exchanging contracts, but the vendors pulled out at the last minute, which left Mr Johnson fuming.
Luo Fengshan will file a lawsuit on behalf of Lin Yi against Youyang City People's Court.
The court held that the parties ultimately failed to sign a formal contract and that the failure should not be solely attributed to the defendant. Accordingly, the plaintiff should be reasonably presumed to have been unable to reach an agreement with the defendant. Therefore, the defendant should not be liable to pay double damages for breach of contract.
After the first trial, the plaintiff files an appeal.
Recently, the second instance court upheld the original judgment.
【Legal advice】 During the transaction process, it is necessary to pay attention to the obligation of caution.
When signing the contract, the buyer shall fulfill the necessary cautious obligations, such as verifying the information of the property owner, whether the property is occupied, and specifying the specific time and place of delivery in the contract to prevent disputes during the performance of the contract.
(Deutsche Welle Chinese) After the "Democracy Summit" ended on Friday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said in a statement on Saturday (December 11) that the United States held a "Leaders Summit" under the slogan of "drawing a red line for democracy", which means "to instrumentalize and weaponize democracy, and in the name of democracy, incite division and confrontation, and transfer domestic conflicts".
The Chinese government believes that "for a long time, the United States has forced its political system and values on people, carried out 'democratic transformation', imposed unilateral sanctions, and launched 'color revolution', causing disastrous consequences."
Democracy has long become a "大规模杀伤性武器" for the United States to interfere in other countries.
The summit is an action in line with Biden's election pledges.
The two-day meeting will be conducted through video conferencing, with leaders from 111 countries around the world invited, including the leader of Taiwan, but without inviting leaders from China and Russia.
On the eve of the summit, China and Russia criticized the United States for having problems with its own democracy and claimed that the United States was not qualified to hold such a summit.
There are also doubts internationally and in the United States, for example, about the invitation list, which included some leaders with authoritarian tendencies, such as leaders from the Philippines, Poland and Brazil, and some suspect that the purpose of the summit was not to promote democracy but to serve geopolitical purposes.
The newly appointed German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, also attended the video democracy summit.
The statement of the Chinese Foreign Ministry on Saturday said that "the American disease of democracy is most pronounced today. Issues such as money politics, identity politics, party confrontation, political extremism, social division, racial conflict, wealth polarization" are becoming more and more serious. American democracy is built on the basis of "rich people's games".
In his speech, President Trump stated, "As the leader of our government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen the guardrails of democracy, push for reform, achieve transparent accountability, and resist the forces of authoritarianism and corruption that seek to undermine our democracy."
He stressed that democracy is not a given, "We have to keep reinventing it in every generation, in my view the great challenge of our time.
Biden also said that global democracy and human rights "are facing sustained and distressing challenges, and democracy needs warriors to defend it."
The United States has pledged to launch a one-year campaign after this democratic summit, which includes a $424.4 million initiative to strengthen democracy around the world and provide support to independent news media.
The United States hopes that countries will make specific public commitments to improve their democratic systems before the planned physical democracy summit in late 2022.
Let us all countries implement our commitments and report on the progress we have made next year, said Biden.
Ok, I just hope he got the address wrong

Taste good, meat dish nice, service with enthusiasm
It's been a long time since we last met. Fruit picking is still so delicious and the materials are so real. The first time trying dumplings, it is the southern style of my beloved soft flour dumplings!
The dryness of the congee was just right, and the portion was very generous. The chicken wings made with tinfoil were as delicious as ever, and the soup was not bad either. The pickled vegetables were also well-handled.
Tasty, attentive service, good meat
Jiashan Old Store was also a popular existence many years ago. The single-story building and wooden floor.
There was always a long wait for the bowl of congee at the door, and the pot of congee would be split open...
A few years have not gone to Jiaochang yet. The rise and fall of all kinds of small shops have become scattered.
We were fortunate enough to get a seat, and the food quality was as good as ever.
Taste good, meat dish praised.
Japanese food delivery.
[Rice] Meal: This dish was a bit disappointing this time.
Three cups of chicken: the vegetables are a bit excessive and the chicken is slightly lacking.
This dish’s main flavor is a bit off, the salty flavor at the bottom is insufficient, thus highlighting the sweet flavor. You can supplement the sweetness with various spicy and aromatic dishes...
What is the "Red Card" taboo drinking method?
Everyone's hobbies are different, some people like to collect, some people like to eat美食, of course, there are also those who like to drink, Red Label whisky is currently one of Scotland's best-selling whiskies in various countries, and Red Label whisky has won the International Wine & Spirit Competition Gold Award.
Every bottle of red wine has its unique taste, but if you don't know how to appreciate it, it would be a waste of its aroma.
So how do you drink a Bloody Mary?
Let me introduce it to you simply.
The Red Card Rule:
Gin made with 35 varieties of Scottish whisky, it has the characteristics of traditional Scottish whisky and a strong fragrance, with a sweet and smoky aroma.
The entrance is fresh and slightly fragrant with a strong aroma of barley.
The vodka can be drunk straight up or mixed with your favorite beverage.
The Bloody Mary, once banned in China as a foreign import, has become a timeless fashion in the country as adaptations using local tastes such as Coca-Cola, Sprite or Qingdao Beer are popular.
These sweet drinks not only neutralize acidity, but also visually please people. When added to drinks, they can change the taste of alcohol and make it more refreshing.
The authentic and most traditional way to drink it is with a slice of lemon and a spoonful of sugar (white or brown).
The true red wine has a slightly sour taste, adding sugar can neutralize the sourness, lemon will give the wine a fresh aroma, of course, the sweet-sour degree can be according to personal taste.
The above three are the best drinking methods for red wine. You can try them. Hopefully, our introduction can help you.
Education Thought: How do college entrance exams make “tigers” and “flops”?
Three students of Lanzhou Transportation University wrote a letter to the school leader, expressing their confusion about the university entrance examination and proposing to increase the difficulty of the examination, change the form of the examination and make the examination really reflect the actual level of students.
Indeed, for a long time, college entrance examination has been a “hot topic”.
In the university campus, students come from all over the country, with different levels of ability, and different learning experiences.
There are different opinions about groups with such diverse characteristics.
Of course, if the exam questions are all the same type, the repetition rate is high, and the questions are too simple, it will inevitably lead to a completely different feeling.
Students who are not diligent may be able to pass the exam with a concentrated attack before the exam, but if they want other methods, they may achieve twice the effect with half the effort.
In this way, just by not investing, you can pass the exams, and even get high scores. In contrast, the “know-it-all” never misses a class and does well in homework and note-taking, but still cannot get high scores in the exam.
It seems that the students of Lanzhou University have reflected the problems that exist in the college entrance examination. It is believed that such a situation does not exist in Lanzhou University alone.
In this sense, it is praiseworthy for these three students who wrote letters directly.
In fact, everyone who has been to college knows that it is common for students to prepare for the college entrance exam and try various methods to obtain the exam questions from the teachers, compete for the exam scope, and seek intensive tutoring before the exam. It is even common to see students cheat during the exam or seek the help of their teachers after the exam.
In the author's view, as a kind of teaching quality evaluation orientation, it is more about the comprehensiveness of teachers' command of teaching and learning, as well as scientific issues based on this foundation.
At the undergraduate stage, specializations become more detailed, and many specialized courses focus on basic knowledge.
There is no doubt that whether you have comprehensively mastered the basic knowledge points of a subject is what the college entrance exam wants to test.
The basic knowledge of undergraduate courses is mainly based on disciplinary foundation theories and common sense. In terms of knowledge points, the space for change is not large. It is fixed.
As the teacher said, "The basic knowledge of mathematics learned 20 years ago in college is still being studied now and is still the focus."
But this does not mean that the examination questions are repetitive.
In many colleges, exams are generally composed of question groups, which are then compiled into试卷 by the department’s senior teachers. The exam papers are also graded by all the teachers in the department, so that the problem of repeated questions can be to some extent overcome.
But to design a set of tests that are consistent with actual teaching and have a normal distribution according to students' overall learning status, in addition to comprehensively grasping the teaching situation and comprehensively analyzing the degree of students' learning, so that the exam questions are dynamically grasped in terms of difficulty and type, which can highlight the basic knowledge examination and comprehensively consider the ability to examine while being innovative in the design of the questions.
Exams are the commanding rod of university education. Any exam, and students will have a corresponding preparation plan. In the past, this has affected the effectiveness of university education.
Lanzhou Jiaotong University attaches great importance to the recommendation letter for students. A reform plan has been put in place school-wide.
Require each teaching unit to organize teachers to carry out research and course final exams self-check, formulate exam questions and relevant regulations, strengthen supervision and inspection of exam questions and review cycle, refine grading criteria, and strengthen comprehensive supervision of all teaching sections.
Solving the problem of single-type test questions and repeated questions from the mechanism is a major issue that college entrance examinations need to face. Of course, corresponding systems need to be established, but the key is that teachers need to have a comprehensive grasp of the teaching situation. They should not only understand the teaching content, but also the learning situation of students. Only in this way can teaching and learning be better connected, and a positive interaction be established. The examination will also be more in line with the actual situation, so that “学霸” and “学渣” can each find their place.

Golden Lady Wedding Dress Photography (Nan Street Store) has not yet branched out
We changed the time twice before the photo shoot because we did not arrange the time properly. Advisor Lan Lan patiently helped us arrange the time.
Later, they chose a good weather weekend to shoot.
Mrs. Kim's staff, whether consultants, makeup artists or photographers, all speak highly of her.
It was my first formal make-up in my life. Wow ~ I can't believe it. I will also look like that one day, ha ha.
Xiaojing and the other girl (I'm sorry, I forgot her name) applied makeup super patiently, and the makeup also very natural.
The scene was filmed in Jiaxing, Zhejiang Province. Fortunately, the weather was good that day and I did not feel cold. While filming, the make-up artist occasionally paid attention to our clothing, hairstyle, and slightly helped us to arrange.
The photographer was also very humorous, and he felt very happy after taking photos for a day.
At the time of selecting photos, as I had seen many cases online, I did not want to let the customer delete too many photos. However, when we were selecting photos, we really did not have the intention of adding any photos. There were 24 photos in the package, and not a single one was added. (I heard that my cousin, who got married just a few days after me, had over 7,000 photos added to her package, bringing the total to over 8,000 photos. I was shocked at the time, and I was also afraid that I would select too many photos)
The photos were repaired today. Lan Lan sent them to me. I saw two that were not good. They immediately helped me redo them.
To compare the photos taken by my sister before, I felt that our photos were really satisfactory, simple and fresh, which was the style I wanted.
Sincerely recommend everyone to go and have a look at Chan Han’s wedding photos!
Price: 3999 yuan
Mrs. Kim expressed her gratitude for your sincere wishes for her happiness and a bright future.

3,200 babies born in Shaanxi without birth certificates due to counterfeit paper cutting supply
(Azerbaijan 11th day of the month) The State Registration Service of the Republic of Azerbaijan said that due to the use of special paper for the storage of passports, it has been impossible to issue birth certificates to newborn babies since the beginning of October. To date, 3200 people have been affected.
However, the director of the center, Khalid Amirunus, said that all babies who have applied for birth certificates will be recorded in the system. The false birth certificates will be issued next week.
At a press conference, he explained a 10-month-old report by a web media alleging problems in the printing of the Sabah newspaper.
He said the issue arose two months ago and that Salt Lake was facing similar problems.
One of the reasons is that Chinese manufacturers producing special anti-counterfeit paper have been affected by the epidemic, resulting in delays in delivery to China.
He explained that the counterfeit-detecting paper used by Saipan's newspaper is different from that used in other areas, so it cannot be shipped to other states.
It is revealed that the latest batch of counterfeit notes arrived in Kuala Lumpur on the 6th of this month and was handed over to the printing company on the 8th for partial printing work.
The agency will send a courier to Kuala Lumpur next Thursday to pick up the passports and bring them back to Sharjah for the final stage of printing, which should take about two working days (December 20).
We will notify the applicants to go to the local branch to pick up the admission notice.
He added that Shabbi has issued a total of 24,801 birth certificates since the beginning of this year.
More than seven years later
Is it just about time?

According to the notice, the time range for the above requirements is from the date of determining the scope of coastal cities in each province, district and city to the date of March 15, 2022.
In addition, the notice also proposed that conditional coastal cities may study the establishment of epidemic prevention and control buffer zones within their jurisdiction.
The head of the Disease Prevention and Control Office of the National Health and Family Planning Commission introduces that for some coastal cities, cross-border trade is the local main economic pillar, and the two sides are frequent.
A differentiated management policy will be implemented, with a single line of defense becoming two lines, in order to achieve front-end control, compress the risk of epidemic spread, and achieve the maximum effect of controlling the epidemic with the minimum social impact and cost.
Recently, there have been several local outbreaks in China, all of which were imported from overseas.
The above notifications pointed out some places where the epidemic monitoring warning was not timely, high-risk personnel closed-loop management was not implemented, regular nuclear acid detection flow was not in place, carcass disposal was not in place at all levels of the cold chain, and isolation camp management was not standardized.
The notice requires efforts in nine aspects, including improving the mechanism for preventing and controlling epidemics in coastal cities, building a sound system for monitoring and forecasting epidemics, implementing border control measures, and accelerating the filling of gaps in the prevention and control short board of coastal cities, doing a scientific and accurate job in prevention and control, and tightening the external input prevention line.
The notice emphasizes that cities on both sides of the strait should study and deploy the prevention and control of the epidemic and the people's livelihood security work in synchronization, publish and open the people's livelihood security hotline, and regularly check the hidden problems in the supply and price of basic necessities of life, and timely solve and proactively respond to the outstanding problems反映 by the masses.
According to the notice, the coastal cities referred to include counties (cities, districts, municipalities), as well as the provinces (autonomous regions, municipalities) and states where the open land, water and air ports are located. The specific scope will be determined by the provinces (autonomous regions, municipalities) according to the epidemic prevention and control needs and will be promptly announced.

Oil pipeline video: The beginning of the US military's 20-year bloodshed in Iraq - Xinhua
(Video source: Oil Pipeline)
On December 11, a micro-documentary named "Killer Machine" on the oil platform caused widespread attention.
The film tells the story of the United States launching the Afghanistan war under the pretext of “anti-terrorism”, forcibly exporting American-style democracy through the war, and the 20-year long war, brutality, indiscriminate killing, and various crimes against humanity committed by the soldiers.
abused drones to attack hospitals, schools and other civilian locations, distorting humanity and establishing death squads.
Over the past 20 years, the US military has killed tens of thousands of innocent Afghan civilians.
The US military set up a "black prison" to apply various torture and humiliation to "suspects".
A series of anti-human crimes has aroused more hatred among Afghans.
As the video shows, the American "anti-terrorism" war "the more you are terrorized".
The war has not brought peace, democracy, and prosperity to the Afghan people; it has only brought a country riddled with landmines and countless acts of killing and destruction.
Watch the video, let's uncover the truth together about the US's "anti-terrorism" and the false face of American democracy!
Accidentally, I came across the following article that discusses why a customer wants a logistics company in the bonded zone to do packaging, although packaging is a deep processing and not within the scope of operations of a bonded logistics company. Perhaps the following words can explain why the customer wants to do it this way.
I went to many dairy factories and came into contact with many production lines of dairy products.
In fact, the raw materials used for packaging and hearing aids are identical, with no difference at all.
So, people will certainly ask: Why is the warranty period for the bag only one year, while the warranty period for the hearing aid is two years or even longer?
Alternatively, one might ask: Why is the price difference between hearing aids and behind-the-ear devices so large?
In fact, many consumers, or mothers, believe that this is because the raw material is different, so the quality is much better.
In fact, the same material, only if expensive is good.
Some consumers, out of this mentality, have eaten the aftertaste and said that the taste or flavor is different!
Now, let me first tell you the reason why listening is expensive. Where is the cost?
Why is the price so different when the raw materials are the same?
Because at the time of pricing, most manufacturers take into consideration that if the packaging price is too high, consumers will find it difficult to accept, which means that the manufacturers’ profits are very low, or in other words, there are no profits at all. So how do these manufacturers survive?
So they have a very large increase in pricing to protect their profit margins.
Hence, most manufacturers are pushing in-ear rather than on-ear headphones.
And then there are the tens or even hundreds of millions of advertising fees that manufacturers have to pay every year. Where does this money come from?
As we all know.
Therefore, with the development of society, the market promotion cost, such as mall promoters, mall display fees, product giveaways, advertising fees, etc., are also increasing.
Therefore, manufacturers are constantly increasing new products, and prices are also constantly rising. In fact, these are new products that come with the increase in market costs.
The main purpose is to obtain higher profits. In fact, the cost of their raw materials increased by at most 3-4 yuan.
There are also some brands that, in order to promote their own products, would stop at nothing, collaborating with doctors in hospitals to help promote their products. Profits range from 30 yuan to 80 yuan per prescription.
China’s relevant laws are absolutely not allow such operation. In fact, this approach is to damage consumers.
It is suggested that people buy bagged milk powder and pour it into cans under the premise that they have cans at home. This can save costs and increase the preservation and airtightness of the milk powder, which has no effect on children.
In addition, do not think that the warranty period of hearing aids is longer than that of packaging. If the warranty period of hearing aids and packaging is the same after packaging, it only means that packaging is not easy to save and easy to be affected by humidity.
The food was delayed and when it arrived it was cold, hard and completely inedible.
And the soup was delicious

Don't scare people at the starting line - Xinhua website
At the book fair, one can often feel the explosion of successful academic books.
Today's successful self-help books all promote the "best principle" - that is, to assume or imply that you can "do it" first, and then tell you what you need to do.
In other words, it has passed over the most important and fundamental question of “how to do it”.
That's why all these books have a common feature - either go all out or do not go at all; either be 100 or 0; either climb Mount Everest or do not climb at all.
This "principle" looks good on paper, but in practice, 99% of people are intimidated before they even reach the starting line.
Because this theory advocates a path of "you've got to be determined, reinvent yourself, make a 180-degree turn," which is precisely the Achilles heel of many people.
For those who are stubborn and set in their ways, you might as well scream "you need to change" right into their ears. It's undoubtedly an act of self-deception.
Most people will be hesitant in the face of "transformation", fearful of taking the first step, and find it difficult to make a firm decision. Or they make a decision to "transform" based on momentary impulse, and take the first step bravely, but the good results seldom last long, and they cannot persist for long.
The monologue of Mr. Ma in the famous "From Tomorrow" is a classic that best represents this "universal human nature".
The biggest problem with the "golden rule" is that the threshold is too high, often surpassing the limits of ordinary people, making the vast majority of people "gasp in admiration."
Perhaps "the second principle" is a way that may lead more ordinary people to a path of relative success.
The core of the "secondary principle" is to "lower the threshold" - it encourages a "little victory leads to a big victory" theory, that is, if you can't do 100, just do 1, because 1 is always greater than 0; if you can't climb Mount Everest, just climb the small sand dune by your door, because that will always be stronger than the original step.
After all, anything is better than doing nothing at all.
Because the threshold is greatly reduced, it becomes more likely for ordinary people to persist. And as long as persevere, the success rate will also increase.
However, the successful path that follows the "second-best principle" is slightly shorter.
In short, "the best principle" may sound on the surface to enable everyone to succeed, but it ultimately motivates only a few; whereas "the second best principle" can effectively motivate more people and try to benefit as many as possible.
Do I need to reorder now?
No one answers the phone.
Endless delay
Not yet.
When will it arrive?
How can we contact you?
Please cancel the order.
I can't wait anymore, thank you.

I want to ask, how to contact jockeys

The resources of Lake Qinghai this year increased by 71,000 tons - Xinhua network
Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, December 11 wire (Reporter: Luo Xiaofei, Zhang Hongxing) The reporter learned from the Qinghai Provincial Agriculture and Animal Husbandry Department that the latest monitoring results showed that the quantity of crucian carp resources in the Qinghai Lake this year increased by 71,000 tonnes to 108,500 tonnes, which was 40 times more than when protection began in 2002.
The common carp in Qinghai Lake, known as "crucian carp", is a precious fish species in Qinghai Lake, and plays a heavy role in ensuring the safety and diversity of the "water-fish-bird" ecological chain in the Qinghai Lake watershed.
In the 1960s and 1970s, the number of fish caught and the degradation of the aquatic environment due to human activities such as large-scale killing and overfishing had a significant impact on the number of Lake Baikal omul. By 2002, the omul resources in Lake Baikal had decreased to only 2,592 tons.
In 2004, the grass carp in Qinghai Lake was listed as a threatened species in the "Red List of Chinese Species".
Since 2003, Qinghai Province has implemented lake fishing and prohibited any unit, group, or individual from catching and selling carp and its products in Qinghai Lake and its main rivers and tributaries.
At the same time, through the measures such as artificial breeding and release, as well as cleaning the main inflow rivers and channels, and designing scientific and reasonable "fish passages", the protection intensity of Qinghai Lake will continue to increase year by year.
Yang Lin, deputy director of the Qinghai Provincial Department of Agriculture and Animal Husbandry, said that as of now, the cumulative number of artificial breeding and release of Lake Qinghai carp has reached nearly 180 million. The contribution rate of Lake Qinghai carp resources recovery is more than 23%.
The source area of the three rivers in Qinghai is an important ecological barrier and water source conservation area in China and even Asia. The Qinghai Lake is a natural barrier and ecological function area that controls the spread of desertification from the west to the east.
In order to protect the ecological environment of the Sanjiangyuan area and the Qinghai Lake water area, protect aquatic wild animals, and maintain the biodiversity of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, since this year, Qinghai has successively issued notices of key water areas of the Yangtze River, Yellow River and Qinghai Lake for total prohibition of fishing, and established a comprehensive prohibition management system of “one river, one lake, one prohibition”.

An hour has gone by and still nothing
Just saw a fake news article, it's too long.
Give a little science to the unsuspecting male.
Most girls have their first period between the ages of 13 and 15, and menarche typically occurs around age 50.
Once a month, as long as your body is healthy.
But it's not a regularity to be able to predict it with certainty, with a margin of about one week, it is necessary to anticipate, sometimes even the luck difference can turn things around (suddenly several days in advance).
The length of time, the amount of bleeding and the severity of the pain vary from person to person. Some recover within three days, while others take a week; some have minor bleeding, while others have a major haemorrhage. Some have no reaction, while others feel so unwell that they need to be taken to hospital in an ambulance. Pain can change over time and just because someone is pain-free now, it does not mean they will be pain-free for life.
With no control over menstruation, for several days of continuous bleeding, all one can do is to prevent blood from flowing onto the chair by using a sanitary towel or piece of cloth.
The main reason for menstrual pain is due to the secretion of progesterone. Eating broccoli just a few days before menstruation can effectively alleviate menstrual pain. After the onset of menstruation, eating broccoli is of no use.
In the physiological period, because the uterus is full of blood and the release of prolactin is too much, it is easy to swell the abdomen.
If it is close to the period, no matter how mysterious the stomach is, it will come within two days after menstruation.
It is recommended to change sanitary pads every two to three hours to avoid the breeding of bacteria. Sleep time is excluded. The worst scenario is to change six times a day, 42 pieces a month. If you prepare in advance, there may be 50 pieces, and it is not changed every month.
("This will be modified. The toilet paper doesn't have to be changed often. It can be changed once every five to six hours or up to eight hours.")
PMS symptoms may be more severe, and menstruation may be disrupted due to hormonal changes, resulting in mood swings and feeling bloated.
But the official crime rate data can see that the ability of women to control their emotions is still very high, and will not become an excuse for emotional problems.
The fluid is not just blood, but also contains shedding endometrium.
The thinning of the uterine lining after the end of menstruation, and its gradual thickening thereafter, can be likened to a house. Each month, a house is built (the lining thickens) in preparation for guests, but no guests arrive, so the house is taken down (the lining thins) and a new one is built the next month, and so on.
The moon is not convenient. For decades, every month for several days and 24 hours, abdominal and back pain will occur. Who wants it?
But people can be born only because his mother had gone through the confinement. Confinement is the house prepared for you to live for the first 10 months when you come to this world. We should thank our mothers for their healthy confinement.
A lot of things that women were forced to do in the past were considered dirty, shameful, everyone thought that was it, but times have changed.
If anyone thinks the moon is evil and that women's bodies are evil preparations for life, they should not say so in public. Girls, stand up and do not think like that. Those who have never experienced it will never experience it. This old man will never experience it and will never understand. Men, do not be so ungrateful and ignorant. How can such an attitude face their mothers? How can they want their children?
Finally, the sisters tried the sanitary pads, which were really useful.
Today is the Winter Solstice festival, but the gift-giving let people down.
We should order food for the children too.
Hope the store can check the product
Did the foot bath bubble feet and itch? Is it because of electric leakage?
选择合适的足浴盆可以起到很好的足疗保健作用，今天国美小编将针对这个问题做出解答，希望对朋友们有所帮助。
With the enhancement of people's health awareness, foot baths are increasingly favored by consumers. A large number of products with different specifications have appeared in the market, ranging from more than RMB 100 to above RMB 1,000. This has given consumers great choices.
In the relevant data table, compared with traditional home appliances, the sales of health care home appliances such as foot bath are booming, but there is no special industry standard for foot bath, so there is a certain security risk.
"Standing on an electrified water surface is too dangerous!"
Mr. Li told reporters that he had bought a foot bath as a birthday gift for his father, but his father felt a sense of numbness in his feet when he soaked them.
At first, Mr. Li thought the vibration was caused by the foot bath function, but when he turned off the vibration function, his father still felt a sense of numbness in his feet.
Mr. Li tried it with a pen, the pen worked, and he was amazed to find that the water in the bathtub was electrified.
He later contacted the trader but the trader's attitude was not bad although the bathroom basin had been removed, Mr Lee said.
Because he found that the bathtub, which has long been popular, has no clear and detailed industry standards in terms of the highest temperature setting, applicable population, material safety and so on.
However, in general, the bathtub is not prone to electricity problems, but it is not excluded that a small number of products are not strictly sealed at the factory.
So choose a separate foot bath when buying.
The separation of water and electricity poses no safety hazards.
You can also take a pen and paper while you're there.
The 13th China Tea Expo kicked off - news headlines - lakehunan.com - huanqiu.com
Hunan Daily December 10 news (Reporter: Zhangang Wu; Editor: Mengmeng Han; Staff Reporter: Liu Xiaoli; Photographer: Li Jian) The 13th Hunan Tea Industry Expo and Innovative Red Tea Promotion Conference was held at the Hunan International Convention and Exhibition Center this morning, displaying the tea industry, innovative tea technology, promotion of tea culture, and accelerating the goal of achieving a trillion-yuan tea industry.
Deputy Director-General of the China National Sales Cooperation Association Huo Shunli and Deputy Director-General of the Provincial People's Congress Yao Hong attended the opening ceremony.
Professor Liu Xinhua, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, made a solemn introduction during the opening ceremony: the source of Lake Red is new, and the rise of red tea will inject new momentum.
In recent years, the Provincial Party Committee and government have vigorously supported the development of the tea industry and promoted the construction of a trillion-yuan Pu'er tea industry. A development pattern of "Three Pu'er, Four Waters and Five-Color Tea" has taken shape.
Innovation is picking up in the tea industry in Anhui. The main tea varieties, including green tea, black tea and red tea, are rotated for planting. Tea tourism is being advanced in the tea producing areas, which will benefit a large number of tea farmers.
With the cycle of wind and water, the red tea is reinvigorated.
According to experts in the tea industry, tea farmers can earn income all year round from the picking of green tea, red tea and black tea, and tea plantation output value is on the rise.
At the launching ceremony, the provincial leaders awarded the fourth batch of enterprises with the right to use the "Hunan Red Tea" trademark, and they were thrilled with the "Origins of Hunan Red Tea".
At the modern red tea museum, Fujian tea merchants immediately placed an order for a high mountain tea called “Ice Ring Spring”
Wang Jian, the Secretary-General of the Provincial Tea Association, said that the current epidemic and other factors have to some extent affected the tea market, but from the scene of the Tea Expo, brilliance is abound.
Newly-made red tea is a touch of red, injected with the connotation of tea culture. The atmosphere is lively, and the transaction is booming. The tea industry welcomes the new spring.
If the food is not hot, can it be cancelled?
Never mind. As he couldn't find a parking place, he couldn't deliver it.
Formal logic is the study of questions that cannot be directly perceived but can be answered through rational reasoning and logic.
Metaphysics is the basic principle of philosophy, aiming to explain the basic nature of existence and the world.
The English translation of the sentence "形而上学" is taken from the Yi Jing·Si Xu, "The way of the above is called the Dao, the way of the below is called the tool." This sentence was translated into Japanese by Inoue Enryo (Meiji era) as "Metaphysics."
The philosophical branch includes ontology, natural theology, and their extensions.
The study of ontology is "researching what entities represent real existence and what names only represent concepts".
Philosophical naturalism denies the existence of God.
Its theoretical foundation believes that all phenomena can be explained by the concept of natural causes, proposed by philosophers who support scientific and evolutionary theories.
The method of naturalism refers to a research method that does not posit the existence of God.
Psychophilosophy is a branch of philosophy that studies the essence of consciousness and their relationship with the body (especially the brain).
Dualism and materialism are the two main philosophical ideas that discuss the relationship between the soul and the body.
Philosophy of knowledge is a branch of philosophy that explores the nature, origin, and scope of knowledge.
Ethics is the systematic study and contemplation of human moral life; here, morality is defined as a set of behavioral norms recognized by a group of people or a culture.
主要分为元伦理学（抽象地研究伦理理论或批判的本质）、规范伦理学（评判各种不同的道德观，并且对于正确或错误行为给出道德准则建议。
It studies what kind of moral behavior guidelines people should follow), applied ethics (academic disciplines that apply ethical theories to real-life situations, including biomedical ethics, political ethics, etc.), and descriptive ethics (gathering information about how people live, and summarizing from observed styles).
Its examination of ethics is not based on presupposed theories, but on the actual choices made and observed by moral agents, which have produced all moral factors contributing to this decision, and it explores the ethical views held by social groups.
The history of ethics includes Greek Roman ethics and medieval Christian ethics.
Part One: Humanistic Ethical Thought, represented by Valla and Montaigne.
The second part: The ethical philosophy of religious reform, represented by Calvin.
The third part: political ethics, represented by Machiavelli and others, modern ethics (17-18th centuries, British empiricist ethics, represented by Hutcheson, 17-18th centuries, continental rationalist ethics, represented by Spinoza, 18th century, French Enlightenment ethics, represented by Rousseau, 18-19th centuries, German idealist ethics, represented by Kant and Hegel, 18-19th centuries, British utilitarian ethics, represented by Bentham and West, 19th century, British evolutionary ethics, represented by Spencer and Wallace, 19th century, German neo-Kantian ethics, represented by Lipps, and 19th century and later, German new Kantian ethics, represented by Rickert), transitional ethics (ir
Logic is a discipline that studies the principles and standards of effective argumentation and proof.

Ting Ziru: A friend.
I sincerely thank all my friends for their humanitarian assistance over the 30-plus years since our relative's untimely demise, especially those who responded to my personal appeals for humanitarian assistance both domestically and internationally in early 1994, which has continued until today.
Now, most victims' parents have passed away. The orphans have grown up and found jobs.
Your selfless help has helped these needy families through the most difficult times.
The current COVID-19 pandemic is raging globally and most donors have already retired.
Therefore, I humbly request that you cease donations to us, the Tiananmen Mother's Group, a humanitarian relief effort that should have ended long ago.
I will always remember your love and believe that your efforts will be engraved in history.
Due to various reasons, I can only express my will in this way, please understand my friends!
Please accept my sincere blessings.
Pottery Industry News: Allow me to take this opportunity to give a simple introduction to the 32-year history of humanitarian aid by the International Federation of Scholarly Societies (IFCSS) and the Minneapolis China Democracy Fund (MCDF).
In the process of engaging in humanitarian aid, the American Association of University Professors for Global Peace and the Minneapolis Chinese Democracy Fund are parallel organizations, and project implementers often intersect.

Aid often cannot be smoothly sent to the hands of those in dire straits on June 4.
In 1994, at the suggestion of Father Ding, a specialized team called "Mother of Tiananmen" was established to coordinate and distribute humanitarian aid.
In 1998, the MCDF established the "June 4th Orphans Education Fund" and carried it out for 11 years. In 2009, after all the June 4th orphans graduated from university, the MCDF established the "June 4th Orphans Welfare Fund for the Elderly" and has been implementing it to this day.
The funds for these projects mainly come from donations from campuses and society in the year of 1989, from personal generosity, and are supported by the Brothers for Democracy Foundation.
Since 2018, it has also received support from the Labor Research Foundation.
It was not until last year, 31 years later, that the June Fourth victims finally received a portion of the donations raised in Hong Kong in the name of June Fourth that year.
During this period, "China Human Rights" was also independently carrying out their humanitarian aid project.
We understand that Mr. Ding called for donations on June 4 is for the donors to consider. We are indeed some retired people, and our income is not as affluent as before. In this regard, we express our gratitude to Mr. Ding's letter of thanks to "compatriots".
We will respect their decision to terminate the project within two years and restore it as needed.
We should express our gratitude and respect to those who have been insisting on generous assistance and taking risks to deliver humanitarian aid for years.

Member evaluation
[Effect] Photo effect: The overall effect of the two pieces of clothing is not bad. I quite like this set of photos.
[Service] Service details: I was a bit uncomfortable during pregnancy, so the makeup artist and staff were very considerate. They allowed me to rest for a while and gave me a cup of hot water to drink.
The set price is 1000 yuan.
Thank you for the rabbit's review. At first, I said that refusing the old style was not suitable for the old style. I did not expect that the finished product would be so beautiful.
Thank you, Denmark, for your recognition. Your satisfaction will enable us to move forward with full batteries, and we will continue to try!
This photography studio is amazing! I strongly recommend all partners to come!
无论从接待、化妆、服装、灯光、摄影到后期都无可挑剔。

The whole office has an artistic atmosphere and there are two kittens playing around.
We were working in Beijing, and had to queue up half a year in advance to watch a good movie in Beijing. A colleague watched it and thought it was just so-so.
I sought out this workshop, a place with a soul and attitude.
Our facial expression management is poor, and we think this is also the case for most people. Photographer Liao grabbed and recorded the moment of natural brilliance.
Makeup artist, photographer, post-production design, a skilled team.
The finished film was applauded by both ourselves and those around us.
I have recommended the movie to my friends, and they all enjoyed it as well.
We hope that these kind of workshops will not be buried, more and more people will find ta, shoot their own style, instead of thousands of one style.
Thank you very much for the five-star rating from Eagle and Jingling. Both of them are very creative and new people. We are a creative workshop. As long as the customers like us, we will go all out to complete the task. Thank you for recognizing us.

A programming whitepaper about sharing personal experiences.
If you plan to enter this industry, you can choose to find a place for training, but if you don't have this idea, self-study is better because training costs a lot of money and takes six months to learn.
But if the intention is to break into this industry, training is indeed a very good choice, especially for those who are self-taught and weak. Training is even better.
If you have strong self-study ability, you can choose to self-study, but it will be quite tiring.
Of course, choosing a good training institution is very important.
First, we need to look at the institution's teaching strength. If the teaching strength is not strong enough, then the training institution is meaningless. Of course, the teaching strength of some newly opened training institutions is not particularly strong.
Secondly, before choosing, it is better to inquire about this training institution. It is best to inquire about the students who have studied in this institution, after all, only the institution's students know this institution to the bottom, whether the courses are good or not.
Hello, to be honest, I don't know how to answer your question because you haven't made a definite introduction about yourself, and learning this thing and your personal situation have a great relationship.
For example, professionalism, age, the language you want to learn, and even the city where you want to learn, are all related to the industry you want to learn or want to engage in.
If you are a student and have not graduated yet, or if you are a graduate in computer science, I recommend self-study if there is enough time. This is the most efficient and cost-effective way. Nowadays, many online and offline training institutions are actually quite good, but the learning cost is high and the investment time is relatively long. It usually takes 3-6 months to concentrate on training.
However, if I were to say these things, self-study would be very convenient. Nowadays, there are many free learning resources on the internet, and there are also many training resources on the B站. If you don't know where to find resources, you can also contact me for free resources or detailed consultation.
In addition, there are some relatively classic books that can be combined with video comprehensive learning.
If you are not a computer professional but can pay a certain learning and time cost, I suggest going to training institutions to learn. This way of learning is not too tiring, and the teacher's explanation is also very detailed. There are people who specialize in answering questions, and in addition, there is help in learning planning or supervision.
In addition, many training institutions nowadays will sign employment agreements and have internal referral amounts. After learning, they will recommend going to companies. As a result, the interview process for finding a job can be saved.
Above is my point of view. Because I don't understand your situation, I only roughly introduced it. If you have other questions to consult, you can contact me at any time for communication.
I said 10 minutes ago, I saw it on the app
What
I haven't finished yet, what are you doing?
I am proficient in various tasks such as installing, cleaning, and repairing stoves, water heaters, purifiers, washing machines, air conditioners, barrels, lamps, oil burners, lighting fixtures, and glass polishing, as well as providing domestic services.
Thank you to those who silently liked my post. Life is tough but we must continue to strive for it.
Life won't forgive those who don't work hard. If you like it, pay attention to me. Thank those who silently supported me.
Life is like this, others only see the results, but we have to go through the process alone. Facing life, we are not only strong, but also continue. We have no choice but to move forward, we cannot turn back and go back...
Cleanliness is work, it is also a responsibility. Life is beautiful because of service, and service is excellent because of dedication.
Although we do the dirtiest job, we will use the most serious attitude to clean every corner of the customer's home, and see the satisfied smile and raised thumb of the customer. At that moment, all the tiredness is worth it, and there is always a return!
My daily work
-- Your request, my service.
Serve with heart, clean with heart, keep it beautiful.
The details you are concerned about, the housekeeper can do "clean" for me.
Keep your home clean and tidy, decorate your home with beautiful flowers, serve you well, and keep your home clean.
Cleaning indoors and outdoors is my daily work.
Although crystal lamps are beautiful, they will become dull if they are not cleaned for a long time. Only after cleaning can they radiate light. Life is the same.
We put our hearts into our work and strive for success. We pay attention to details and strive for excellence. We take our work seriously.
Give me a chance, and I will definitely meet your expectations. Quality speaks for everything, as it is trustworthy, and your recognition is my biggest encouragement!
All professions nowadays are not good!
But I always believe that as long as you are serious, persevere and work hard, you will be better than others, at least be better than those who only complain.
The plan for the day begins in the morning, all good things start from the morning. Hope you carry happiness, luck, health, and a positive mind to start a new day and maintain a good mood throughout the day. Good morning.
When I was young, happiness was a thing, having it made me happy; when I grew up, happiness became a goal, achieving it made me happy; when I became mature, I discovered that happiness was a state of mind, realizing it made me happy.
Be true to yourself, be kind-hearted, make the most of the present; life is a one-way street, take your own path; life has two treasures: a sound body and a good mind, live a long and happy life!
Every stage of life will encounter different difficulties.
Many times, what holds you back is not ability, but the courage to face it.
Since we can't avoid it, we might as well face it head-on.
The more you fear, the more you will be defeated; if you face difficulties with courage, you will eventually find a solution.
中沙策展人携手举办沙特首届当代艺术双年展-新华网
Xinhua News Agency, Riyadh December 12 wire (Reporter Wang Haizhou) Saudi Arabia's first contemporary art biennial - the Diriyah Contemporary Art Biennial - was officially opened to the public on the 11th at the Diriyah JAX Art District in the northwest of Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia. A total of 64 artists from Saudi Arabia and other countries including China participated in the biennial.
This dual-year exhibition is jointly planned by the Saudi Diriyah Dual-Year Exhibition Fund and the UCCA Ullens Center for Contemporary Art in China. The chief curator is Tian Fei, the director of UCCA Ullens Center for Contemporary Art.
According to the exhibition team, the theme of this year's two-year exhibition is "Crossing the River by Touching the Stone". It is a metaphor for the reform strategy adopted during the period of social and economic transformation. It also reflects the current situation of social cultural development in Saudi Arabia.
The bi-annual event, which occupies nearly 12,000 square meters of space, is comprised of six interconnected buildings showcasing six units: "Stone Bridges," "Inheriting the Experiment," "Marginal Thinking," "Facing the Public," "The Beautiful New World," and "The Spirit of Art."
In particular, the works of 27 Saudi artists accounted for more than 40% of the total number of works at this exhibition, including painting, installation art and performance art, etc. The works of 12 Chinese artists were equally attractive. Some artists created works using recycled materials in an innovative way. For example, Xu Beihong constructed a classic landscape painting “The Endless Landscape” (2014) using waste materials.
Barkley, the CEO of the Diriyah Double Year Fund, said that he hopes that this year's dual year can establish international dialogue and give global audiences a chance to understand Saudi Arabia's cultural industries and creative communities, and strengthen interaction.
Abdulnour said: "The goal of the two-year exhibition is dual, it can enable Saudi contemporary art to participate in the global dialogue and also enable Saudi audience to be integrated into the contemporary art world."
It is understood that a series of lectures will also be held during the two-year cycle. Artists, curators and leaders in the creative industry will discuss topics such as cross-cultural exchange and the development of contemporary art.

Yunnan: The standardized management of village public interest positions
Xinhua News Agency, Kunming December 12 wire (Reporter: Lin Yuefeng) In order to continue to promote the employment of poverty-stricken population and consolidate and expand the achievements of poverty alleviation, Yunnan Province recently issued relevant policies to promote the management of public interest positions in rural areas, helping to comprehensively promote rural revitalization.
The person in charge of the Yunnan Provincial Department of Human Resources and Social Security said that, at present, a total of 448,300 public interest positions in rural areas of Yunnan Province will be opened to help poverty-stricken groups, such as poverty-stricken workers, find jobs so as to help them achieve income increase, consolidate poverty eradication results, and effectively improve the ability of public services in rural areas.
The new regulations were jointly printed and circulated by seven departments including the Yunnan People’s Social Security Bureau, the Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Finance, etc. The regulations mainly standardize the recruitment, remuneration, job development and job management of grassroots public interest positions.
In terms of position development settings, the new regulations clearly state that the settings should be carried out in accordance with the principles of "flexible allocation of positions, fixed person, dynamic management, and total control". "Who develops, who uses, and who is responsible" as well as "one person one position, voluntary publicity, and unified management".
The recruitment process must follow the steps of announcement, application, review, publicity, employment, pre-employment training, and arrangement of on-the-job training.
In addition, the new regulations also clearly defined the specific responsibilities of the main development departments of public interest positions in rural areas, the standards and methods of subsidies for public interest positions in rural areas, and stipulated that the departments responsible for the development of public interest positions in rural areas shall purchase commercial insurance for accidental injury for public interest position placement people. The relevant departments shall periodically supervise the subsidies for public interest positions.

Secondly, although the right-wingers had their day in history, it was short-lived. This is because when you give a child sunshine, they will glow; when you give a child water, they will perspire. A little ambition goes a long way; when you are determined to succeed, you will be attacked by flies.
But in fact, the right wing has played a positive role in the process of social progress.
The positive significance of the right wing should not be denied in terms of defining truth standards, developing the economy, improving science and technology, and promoting administrative systematization and human rights protection.
As far as I am concerned, although I do not fully agree with some of Li Hui's arguments, I am interested in his arguments and respect him as a person. Because he is serious, he is serious about China, and he is serious about China's social problems.
But I oppose his anti-communist theory. I believe that revolution is inevitable, and revolution will inevitably lead to social turmoil, damage to the people's livelihood, and the mixing of politics with dragons and snakes. Then it is just a matter of foreigners taking advantage of the chaos.
IV. To change or improve China, we must have patience and a responsible attitude towards the country for the people. Those who attempt to take advantage of political opportunities are not rightists, but opportunists.
Let's talk more.
The Left, in fact, are orphans of time and politics.
If the right has positive significance for society, the Communist Party would also listen to some of the right's words and analyze their thoughts when necessary. However, this does not mean that the left has become opportunistic, because what the left wants is precisely the dross rejected by the Communist Party!
Recently, I've seen some friends who are so jealous and envious that they're almost hysterical, and it's really quite pathetic. I don't think it's worth it.
Don't try to reason with a prostitute or a leftist, they are both as stubborn as a mule.
Don't try to prove that we are right, and don't try to make the reactionaries and the leftists recognize. Why should we?
That's what I tell my friends: when fascists insult you, when communists insult your dog, that's exactly when our via media is proved right!
Many people have ideals when they are young, but as they grow older, they forget their ideals, or pursue them, but become biased.
And the ideal gradually becomes distant, and even the young dragon becomes a demon dragon.
I think left and right generally refer to restraint and freedom. China, from its genetic predisposition as a civilization, should tend to be left-leaning.
And domestic right-wing liberals emphasize efficiency and development, while left-wingers strengthen regulation and pay more attention to fairness and safety.
Nowadays, the society as a whole hopes to pay more attention to fairness. At the same time, the Sino-American trade war is sure to continue for a long time.
Although incomprehensible, just click and it's done
Never mind, the flowers are just so beautiful
In the past two years, Emperor’s blockade and encirclement of Huawei chips have not only plunged Huawei into an unprecedented dilemma, but also caused great losses to “US” companies.
As a result of US pressure on China’s chip industry, allied enterprises and domestic enterprises simultaneously imposed a blockade on China’s chip industry. The direct consequence was that the orders and profits of global chip suppliers were affected. The R&D investment of chip production enterprises fell, and capacity was reduced. This caused chaos in the global chip supply chain.
The "shortage" has now spread to all major industries around the world, such as automobile production, mobile phone price increases, and all industries that use chips are almost affected.
In order to master the "chip" sovereignty, more and more technology giants begin to move toward "de-Americanization".
In order to firmly control the global semiconductor control rights and curb the development of China’s semiconductor industry, the US side recently took the initiative to hold the “ chip summit” and also invited 64 countries to establish a semiconductor alliance and provided support for the US domestic technology giant. For example, in order to return to the mainstream of the semiconductor industry, the US chip giant Intel has invested 20 billion US dollars to build a wafer processing plant in the US state of Arizona and open up its semiconductor foundry business.
Most people think that Intel's move will have a certain impact on TSMC, and it is likely to snatch away TSMC's "dish".
The reason for such certainty is that Intel, as a leading technology giant in the US, has been deeply cultivating the semiconductor sector for decades and has a large pool of talents and technological reserves. It is bound to make a rapid rise in the short term and defeat TSMC.
However, for Intel's decision, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC) founder Morris Chang did not even bat an eyelid.
At the “2021 Mastermind Knowledge Forum” held in April this year, Zhang Zhongjun made a surprising statement. He said without reservation that Intel’s move to invest in the crystal factory was quite ironic.
The reason why Zhang Zhongjun is quite dissatisfied with Intel's incursion into the round crystal field is that Zhang Zhongjun has been nursing a grudge against Taiwan Semiconductor and Intel for more than 30 years.
In the 1960s and 1970s, Intel has always been the pearl in the manufacturing industry of the United States, and has occupied the top position in the world. It is the leader of the semi-conductor industry in the world.
In the 1980s, the world's high-end semiconductor chips have been monopolized by a few strong players.
At that time, the semi-conductor industry was characterized by IDM mode. The chip, from design to packaging, was completed by a factory. Intel was the representative of that era.
However, this model puts pressure on some small businesses. Many semi-conductor entrepreneurs face huge line construction costs and can only hope.
In response to market demand, in the 1980s, the semiconductor industry began to appear the phenomenon of division of labor cooperation. In 1984, Zhang Zhongjun heard that there were companies that specialized in chip design. Since there were companies that specialized in design, then it would be possible to establish a factory that specialized in crystal manufacturing.
Soon after, Zhang Zhongjun's idea became a reality, and Taizhou Steel was born.
Taicang Electronics focuses on the "polishing" single link in the main business and only provides subcontracting services for polishing. No design is provided.
At that time, newly established Taiwan Semiconductor was just a small ant in front of the giant Intel.
In order to obtain capital support, Zhang Zhongjun once sought investment from Intel, but when Intel heard that Taiwan Semiconductor only made manufacturing segments of the chip industry, it was obviously a little arrogant and did not look down on Taiwan Semiconductor. It firmly refused to invest in Taiwan Semiconductor.
Zhang Zhongjun also believed that Intel at that time was incapable of providing polysilicon production services.
I never expected that the giant in the production of synthetic diamond would begin to do diamond processing.
Therefore, Zhang Zhongjun thought that Intel's entry into the diamond industry is very ironic.
Now the market capitalization of TSMC has exceeded that of Intel.
In the face of TSMC's strong offensive, Intel is also reluctant to seal the deal.
Today, TSMC has already pushed towards 3nm chips, while Intel still remains at 14nm from 7 years ago.
Want to surpass others is not an easy thing.
Finally
Took 2 hours to place the order at 19:06 😅
Let's take a look at some【strange searches】today.
What is normal public opinion?
Randomly select three hot topics: February 2nd Lunar New Year, rise in housing prices, and the Kweichow Moutai incident. Public opinion spreads form a peak, and then [the index declines] (smooth curve) and finally dissipates. If there is a second round of public opinion, there will be a small peak again.
They are quite different from the network sentimentalized model displayed by the website of the State Council Information Office.
What is an abnormal sentiment?
Six hotspots randomly selected from the same event show【peak-like】、【teeth-like】、【cliff-like】.
【孤峰状】即人为加热，迅速冲榜热搜，引起大众关注；【锯齿状】即周期性加热，确保话题盘踞热搜榜单；【断崖状】即集体撤离，该热搜发挥完“功能”，接到新任务、冲向新战场。
In Figure 9, the peak of one event is exactly the trough of another event, and the time difference is just a few seconds. This must be a unified amphibious assault, launching a new round of attacks.
The professionalism of black PR is quite clear at a glance: dozens of hot issues are listed at the same time, which ones are eye-catching, which ones are responsible for popularizing science, which ones are attacking, which ones are shifting focus, which ones are affecting cognition, which ones are misleading judgments, which ones are stirring up emotions, which ones are constraining decision-making, black PR accounts are divided into batches, and node details are refined for battle. Almost all elements of the spread of public opinion are considered.
Spreading is a science. Throwing in a position and all subjective factors, without objective data, the black PR will be nowhere.
Everyone leaves footprints, let's uncover them together.

Mauritius reports first case of HIV infection - Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency Beijing December 12 wire Integrated report by Xinhua correspondents overseas: Mauritius, Seychelles and Malawi have recently reported the first cases of SARS-CoV-2 virus infection.
Mauritius reported its first two cases of HIV infection on the 10th day of the month.
According to Health Minister Keliangi Geiger, one of the cases was a tourist from South Africa who arrived in Mauritius on November 27; the other case was a local resident of Mauritius who tested positive for the virus on November 30 after coming into contact with a person who had recently returned from South Africa.
After isolation treatment in hospital, the two patients tested negative for the virus and have since returned to their respective homes.
On the 10th day of the month, the Cyprus Ministry of Health announced the country's first confirmed cases of Omega-3 virus infection.
All three are students who returned from overseas travel at the beginning of this month. As they are all mild, they did not require hospitalization.
To prevent the spread of the Ebola virus, the government of Sierra Leone continues to increase its prevention and control efforts.
From December 6th to next January 10th, all travelers above 12 years old who enter the country by air must pay for a nuclear acid test at the airport.
On the 10th, the Ministry of Health also announced that the country will begin to vaccinate children aged 5 to 11 against Covid-19.
On the 9th, the Minister of Health of Malawi, Charles Mwansambo, said that the country had discovered its first three cases of Omskatoxin poisoning.
The health department of the country conducted genetic sequencing on 12 positive samples collected from November 9th to December 2nd, and found these three cases of infection.
The takeout never arrived.

I got the money.
The order is for talons.
Good, the phone number is #PHONENUMBER#.
Do I need to stay in the dialogue?
I #NAME# called your staff to explain
Your messenger tells me the address is too far
Great America 360 integrated home
Address: 156 Happy Home, South Ring Road, Chengdu.
Because it was introduced by friends, I chose to have a look at the renovation of my new home with a budget of 70,000 yuan.
A series of tricks begins as soon as you enter the store.
I went to the store just to show them my floor plan. They did not go to the site to measure the house. They gave me a quote of 70,000 yuan for my 135 m2 house. They did not even show me their materials, and I did not know what brand they were.
Their second scam is that you have to hand over the money as soon as you step into the shop (and you will never get it back unless you have enough experience and can argue with them).
While hesitating about whether to pay the deposit, they will invite their so-called manager to tell you how much discount you can get if you pay the deposit to us today.
This is a big pit, and I am an example of being cheated while alive. I deposited more than 100,000 yuan at the spur of the moment.
His quote had a lot of problems. It did not include water and electricity reform, and did not include any doors and cabinets in the bathroom, which are the main costs.
And it charges more than other home-care companies for those services.
I lost trust in this company and I didn't sign the contract at the beginning.
When I went to them to ask for a refund, they behaved in a very experienced way, with a specialized team to deal with you.
No matter how, it is the customer's problem. They are absolutely blameless.
There are all sorts of ways to push the blame around, and a lot of little details, but in the end, don't choose them because my friend who hired them to do the decoration also did a bad job, and you will have to pay for all sorts of costs later.
Damn, they are the original dragon head decoration that tricked people, now turned into a beauty, seems to have changed again.
So don't use a company like that.
Later, when you are choosing, you can look up these consultations because decoration is not a small expense.

Great news! The Perseid meteor shower will peak on the 14th.
Xinhua News Agency Tianjin December 12 wire (Reporter Zhou Rui)天文科普专家 said that as the last large-scale meteor shower this year, the Geminid meteor shower, one of the three major meteor showers in the northern hemisphere, will reach its peak on December 14. Friends who love meteor shower may observe in the night of December 14.
Amateur astronomer An Jiu captured the Perseid meteor shower in Qinghai on December 13, 2018.
Most meteor showers come from periodic comets, but the parent body of the Geminid meteor shower is a small asteroid 3200 Phaethon, which is an Apollo-type asteroid.
The Geminid meteor shower is also the second meteor shower known to not be born from a comet.
According to Qiu Ying, the vice president of the Tianjin Astronomical Society and a professional in popularizing astronomy, the Leonid meteor shower, which is most visible in the night sky in late November, will be visible from December 4 to 17.
The Leonids are known for their high flow rate and stability, and are one of the three major meteor showers in the northern hemisphere, along with the Perseids and Geminids.
A distinctive feature of the双子座流星雨 is that the meteor speed is slow, colorful, and there are many fireballs. It is suitable for both viewing and for beginners in astronomical photography to capture.
On December 13, 2020, Yang Jing, an amateur astronomer in Tianjin, captured a double zodiac rain in Tianjin Binzhou.
Astronomical forecast shows that this year's Geminid meteor shower will peak on December 14 around 15:00, with ZHR (the number of meteors that can be seen per hour under ideal observing conditions, with the radiant point located directly above the observer's head) of 150.

Last year's "Twins" meteor shower left a deep impression on people, but this year's "Twins" meteor shower will be affected by moonlight and the level of brilliance will be reduced.
November 11 is the 11th day of the eleventh month of the lunar calendar. The bright moon will cause interference in the observation and the moon will set in the second half of the night. At this time, the radiation point of the Leonid meteor shower will also become relatively high.
Friends of the shooting stars can observe them in the hours after the moon has set in the second half of the night, but they should pay attention to keeping warm.
How can we observe as many meteors as possible?
It is not recommended to observe in the city. You can choose a place with a clear view to the northeast in the suburbs or countryside, and wait patiently until the moon sets, then observe.
What is worth noting is that the flow rate of双子座流星雨 in all directions is very large. So do not stare at the radiation point of双子座流星雨 all the time when observing.
If you are a friend of photography and want to shoot stunning "shooting stars" pictures, it is best to choose a wide-angle, high-aperture lens. When shooting, use high ISO and the largest aperture.
On the grounds of stability and longevity, a tripod, backup batteries and a flicker line are indispensable."

What is the difference between a laser TV and a traditional TV in terms of market positioning?
According to my understanding, the traditional TV referred to by the topic should be liquid crystal TV. The difference between laser TV and liquid crystal TV in the market position mainly includes the following two points:
First, laser TV will focus on the large screen market.
Compared with the comprehensive market positioning of the liquid crystal TV, the laser TV is obviously more focused on the large screen market, or it can be said that the laser TV is a product born for the large screen.
Currently, mainstream LCD screen sizes range from 55 inches to 65 inches, while the size of laser TVs is generally above 75 inches, with the largest exceeding 100 inches, fully meeting users’ demand for large-screen color TVs.
In recent years, the proportion of laser TVs in global output and sales has been increasing. The proportion of laser TVs in the total sales of 80-inch and above TVs has exceeded 60%.
According to Chunghwa’s forecast, the laser TV market will grow by more than 140% in 2020, and continue to maintain a high growth rate.
The reason for the good performance of the large screen market is mainly due to the outstanding performance of laser TVs in eye protection.
Based on the principle of laser television reflection, the light emitted by the laser source does not directly enter the eyeball. Compared with the backlight of the liquid crystal TV, the imaging process is closer to the natural imaging process under natural conditions, and the stimulation to the eyes is also smaller.
Researchers from the Standardization Research Institute of China’s Electronic Technology and the ophthalmology department of Beijing Joint Hospital compared the strict contrast experiments of laser TVs and LCD TVs under the same population conditions, and obtained 144 sets of test data.
Data confirms: laser TVs do indeed have very strong eye protection characteristics, and in certain aspects, even have a certain improvement.
In the present situation where visual health is becoming increasingly important, laser TV not only attracts more and more users with its eye protection advantages, but also opens another breakthrough in the LED market.
Second, laser TVs are more focused on high-end markets.
Conversely, the price of the LCD TV continues to decline. At present, the price of the laser TV is mostly above 10,000 yuan. With the upgrade of size and light source, the price gradually rose.
Why is the laser TV so expensive?
It makes perfect sense.
With the continuous development of light source and technology, laser TV has many advantages that liquid crystal TV and projectors cannot achieve.
With the short-throw projection technology, the distance between the projector and the screen in the laser TV is shorter than that of traditional projectors. A 100-inch large screen can be realized in a short distance, and the space required is small. In addition, the host is small and occupied space is small.
In terms of brightness, the large brand laser TV can reach more than 2000 flicker-free.
The heating value is lower, the energy consumption is small, and the service life of the TV is also longer.
In addition, many high-end laser TV models also carry many cutting-edge technologies such as true 4K ultra-high definition picture quality, artificial intelligence systems, and holographic screens, which can give users a more stunning visual and auditory experience.
Instead of talking about false demands, it is the product of demand segmentation. Let’s talk about picture quality and input-output ratio. A laser TV is not a toy for audio-visual players. If you want to take both large screen and viewing environment into consideration, you can try it. Everything has its pros and cons. You can judge for yourself after weighing all factors. Don’t just listen to one side.
In simple terms, the ultra-wide-angle projection - laser TV, in order to close to the screen, must use expensive ultra-wide-angle lenses and reflectors, which does not meet the best optical design.
In order to block part of the environmental light, a micro-structured fiber optic screen is used, which is expensive, and the price of the 80-inch screen is basically equivalent to that of a 65-inch liquid crystal screen.
There is one more thing I want to say. I really dislike the advertising point that projector manufacturers always emphasize that their projectors can prevent eye strain. Trustees, the light on the screen that the eyes can see is direct light. You reflect it to the ceiling, the eyes cannot see it. If it is true that liquid crystal TVs also have direct light, then why doesn’t opening the TV screen light up?
Moreover, the screen would not have been made at all if it were not for the mirror reflection.
The hotspots (speckles) of high gain curtains are completely ignored, when a large amount of light is reflected into the eyes, this is really unbearable.
Visual Art Photography Gallery, a store that selects high-quality photography equipment
After adding the WeChat appointment date, the little sister sent me the selected time arrangement. The reply was quite timely.
I watched the shooting works in the store before. There are more outdoor wedding dresses. They are very beautiful. The shooting style involved is also very many.
After that day, I simply exchanged my thoughts with Miss and, with great patience, she helped me try on two sets of my style clothing. Finally, the make-up artist began to make up before the photographer took photos. The photographer would arrange some props, guide the action, and pay attention to every detail.
But it could be because I did not communicate specific shooting ideas with her, so the outcome may not be the style I wanted, but it should be good-looking 🙊🙊
After the shoot, the photographer will help to select photos, and communicate about post-production styles. It is a meticulous class.
The repaired piece will be ready in about half a month. Please wait.
The second time, a feast fit for a king - most of the clothing on offer could be photographed.
Finally, she chose a black dress to experience different styles.
The entire shooting process took about 2 hours, including makeup and shooting. The photographer responsible for the shooting is the photographer's cousin who is in his 30s. He felt a bit inexperienced, hoping to be able to give more advice to customers after the shooting.
Beijing Visual Art Photography Museum Selects
Check out the homepage as well, Queenie~
I filled in my name and telephone number first, and then chose the clothing. All the bridesmaid dresses could be chosen, and I changed into three or four sets of clothes patiently. After choosing, I was made up for a long time, and the service attitude was also good. After taking photos, the photographer taught me how to pose, and it was just like the feeling of having a big face. The editing said it would take half a month, and it arrived in three or four days. It felt like it was the same as the original photo.
Overall, the environment is good.
There are many optional clothing.
The makeup area is just a few doors down from the photography studio.
【Service】Very enthusiastic, also very meticulous.
The stylist is very patient.
The photographer will also teach you how to act seriously.
If photographers are not satisfied, they can also actively request a retake.
【Experience】The shape may be a bit over the top; the original double eyelid has been pasted with a third eyelid.
The eyebrows have also been shaved, which is a bit embarrassing for someone who doesn't usually paint their eyebrows.
The photos were taken ten days ago, but the P-effect is not satisfactory. It feels that double eyelid stickers are still very obvious.
Because it was not clear what style to choose, I tried two sets. The result was hit and miss. So I chose the black suit. The sister said this set was more retro.
After choosing the clothes, she began to make up. The makeup artist and hairstylist sisters helped me make up. The effect is very satisfactory.
After she did her makeup, the photographer took control of my poses, and the process was very smooth and harmonious.
After the filming, he/she carefully chose the four favorite cuts. The little brother said that the ending is very satisfactory.
It's been 3 days without a response... I cannot join the #PRS_ORG# monthly plan because your system cannot recognize my credit card.
The strangest thing was that I used the same credit card every time I paid.
Now I have to pay for delivery every time.
Can you first exempt me and then collect my monthly allowance after you finish the investigation? Is this possible?
Buy insurance for small umbrella, can it be trusted?
Little umbrella is an internet insurance brokerage platform.
To set the scene: According to the "Regulations of the China Insurance Brokers Association (2015 Revision)", to become a insurance broker, one must meet three key requirements: the shareholder and founder in the last three years must not have any serious violations of the law, the minimum registered capital is RMB 50 million, and it must be approved by the China Insurance Association.
In fact, these three are very stringent. In summary, it requires strength, and must be approved by the national authoritative department of the China Banking Regulatory Commission (which regulates all insurance companies and banks in China), the shareholders must have good corporate governance, and it is a small raincoat insurance for insurance brokers. Insurance buyers do not have to doubt whether small raincoat insurance is legal or not. After all, these three requirements are not something that any insurance company can meet.
On this point, he is not wrong, it is trustworthy.
From the perspective of insurance products, the small umbrella insurance is an insurance supermarket. Many companies’ stars’ critical illnesses are sold in this platform. For example, the latest Thai Super Mario 5 critical illness, the insurer and the insured are Thais, and the small umbrella insurance is only an intermediary, so there is no question about its credibility.
From the perspective of payment mode: Internet products are generally priced higher than traditional businesses due to the absence of operating expenses and staff costs. In addition, the payment method is flexible, with support for monthly payments, which can alleviate the burden of premium payments for the insured, while maximizing the leverage of insurance.
This is still very good.
It can be considered.
From the perspective of professionalism: this is particularly important because insurance is an industry that requires strong professionalism. Many Internet product customers can self-insure, which will lead to many errors. In health and occupational categories, non-insurance practitioners often add their subjective awareness when insuring, thinking that they are healthy or suitable. This easily leads to many hidden risks of claims, which may be rejected.
I myself once engaged in insurance sales at “Tencent Weibao” (an internet insurance brokerage platform, just like little umbrella). I will tell you with great responsibility.
The insurance on the Internet is real, but it is also true that people are unreliable. The Internet channels do not have professional staff, and there are many sales misleads.
For example, a 6 million yuan insurance costs 1 yuan. Buy an insurance and get a free 60,000 yuan serious illness benefit. These marketing strategies are not wrong, but they are light on the heavy and will not tell the insured that the first month’s premium is 1 yuan, and the second month onwards is a normal charge of dozens to 200 yuan. Many customers are unclear about the fees they pay for two years.
Assuming that you can spend 1 yuan, the insurance company will pay 6 million (a piece of cake).
Free mobile phone is sent when the policy number is special, such as 6666 and 8888. And if the winning message is sent, the winner will not exchange and no one will remind.
This is another problem for the insured. The free 60,000-yuan serious illness insurance is only for a short period. If there are no other commercial risks, and if a serious illness really occurs, 60,000 yuan will not be enough to solve the problem. The rest of his life will be in debt.
There is also a crackdown on mis-selling of online insurance.
So, all in all, there is no problem with the platform, and there is no problem with the product. The problem is with the professionalism and professional ethics of business staff.
It is suggested that the topic should be comprehensively and carefully considered. In fact, many offline insurance brokerage companies have a wider range of products and more opportunities and products for customers to choose from. Some products are also more cost-effective than online products.
I have helped 59 internet customers and guaranteed offline products, saving each person 2000-3000 yuan/year.
If you have any questions, feel free to communicate with me.
I am an insurance broker at Minya Insurance. I have over 3 years of experience in business management training and have served nearly 1,000 enterprise users. I have cooperated with more than 100 insurance companies. Before insuring, I will start from the customer's needs and customize insurance products for each customer. During the insurance process, I will try my best to obtain the best nuclear insurance result for the customer, and after the insurance, I will help the customer make insurance bills and manage them.
Grow with each customer for life.
I hope my answer can help you!
According to the definition of the insurance regulatory department, internet insurance refers to the insurance business that the insured can independently complete all the insurance process after clicking the insurance link.
In this process, the insurer does not need to sign, and the insurance consultant also does not need to sign. All steps can be independently completed by the insured.
Although there is no “ceremonial” feel to the insurance provided by the Internet, and the printed contract may not even exist, this in no way affects the validity and legal effectiveness of the electronic contract.
This model is a bit like a call centre operation, but buying insurance this way also carries a fatal flaw - the service may not live up to expectations.
Insurance is usually a long-term contract that lasts for decades. When we buy insurance, shouldn’t we think carefully about the “intermediary” we choose? Is it an “insurance intermediary” that can accompany us for a long time and provide services for us even after many years?

Thank you for your help.
From the past to the present, I have always opposed any form of defamation and insult, and I cannot accept such physical attacks.
In civilized society, we can tolerate everything, but we must eliminate this kind of scourge.
If we do not resist the political parties and factions that should be resisted first, it is this kind of uncivilized style.
From the moment you started sending me friend requests on Facebook, and then proceeding to post satirical posts, I had taken an unresponsive stance.
After that, you not only tagged me continuously at the frequency of one day six times a day, but also continued to discuss with your so-called friends on Facebook about some obscure and humiliating remarks about me. You talked about my appearance, figure, good nutrition, and other bedside manner, as well as whether to insert strawberries into your bed or not. I... have had enough.
How do I know later I received more friends coming to tell me about your Facebook friend putting up a photo of you and specific harassment words?
I'm sorry, but as a woman, I can no longer remain silent.
After I reported your news, you became completely unhinged, and even more so.
I don't care about your political background or your social status. In our society, respect for both genders is required.
Yes, you can continue with this type of satirical, implicit, humiliating, and degrading remarks, you can also continue to say that you only care and pay attention to me, you can continue to believe that this is not harassment, and you can even deny that it is not your doing or continue to post all attacking remarks.
It's true, I can't, and I don't have the ability to stop you.
Neither do I know you, nor do I want to know you, my appearance and figure do not need your superficial comments.
I don't think there is any girl who would want to humiliate themselves to such an extent to gain fame.
A friend asked me, "Are you okay?"
I said okay, you won't believe it.
I don't think any woman should have to put up with that kind of abuse and still feel like they're in a good place.
Only those who lack basic decency would choose to harm any woman in this way, whether in the workplace, society, politics or business.
I believe that human nature is inherently free.
I will save some of my comments for everyone to criticize.
Your post should not be imitated by others.
I can only say that you are a civilized enemy.

Yangtze River Delta achieves full coverage of water-based green comprehensive service zone - Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency Chongqing December 11 wire (Reporter Wang Jian) The Phase I construction of Chongqing Waterfront Green Integrated Service Area was completed as scheduled on December 10, which is the second waterfront green integrated service area to be officially put into operation on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River.
Up to now, the green comprehensive service area on water has covered the upper, middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River.
Qiu Jianhua, deputy director of the Bureau of River Transport Management of the Ministry of Transport, said that up to now, 10 green comprehensive service areas have been built and put into operation on the upper and lower reaches of the Yangtze River in Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui and Jiangsu provinces. This has won the recognition of boatmen and played an important role in promoting the high-quality development of Yangtze River navigation.
The full coverage of the green comprehensive service area on the water is another milestone event for the construction of green river transportation in the Yangtze River. The reception of pollutants by Yangtze River ships and the improvement of the transportation service capability are remarkable.
According to the introduction, the water-based green comprehensive service area is an important facility that provides comprehensive production and living services for the majority of ships and crew, helping the majority of sailors solve the problem of "urgent distress".
These two water-side green comprehensive service areas built and put into operation on both banks of the Yangtze River Delta will integrate living, production and administrative services into one, with green environmental protection as the theme, and with ship repair and emergency rescue services as its characteristics. This will achieve “one-stop, multiple services” for ships in the port, making the work of ship crew sailing on the Yangtze River more efficient and convenient.
Three U.S. aircraft carriers gather in the waters around China. Rare visit to the island by the most powerful weapon in the U.S. Navy. January 17, 2022. CCTV news: The latest news on Sino-U.S. relations: The latest satellite images show that the three U.S. aircraft carriers are gathering around China; In addition, the American media also revealed that one of the most powerful weapons in the U.S. Navy, which rarely visits the island, has sent an important signal to the allies and enemies of the United States in the Asia-Pacific region.
According to the news of the "South China Sea Strategic Situation Detection Platform" of China's智库, on January 9, the satellite found the US "USS Carl Vinson" aircraft carrier near the Balabac Strait.
The Panama Canal connects the South Sea and the Suwon Sea, and is a strategically important location on the first island chain in the Western Pacific.
The platform expected that "Kearsarge" will be deployed to the South China Sea.
This is the first time the aircraft carrier "Kearsarge" has deployed the F-35C fighter and CMV-22 "Osprey" tilt-rotor aircraft.
In addition to the USS Carl Vinson, the USS Abraham Lincoln, which departed from the United States on January 3, is also roaming in the Pacific.
The "Lincoln" also for the first time embarked the F-35C aircraft, which belongs to the 314th Marine Fighter Attack Squadron of the US Marine Corps.
In addition to the above two aircraft carriers, the U.S. Navy currently has the “Ronald Reagan” aircraft carrier, which is docked in Yokosuka, Japan, in the Asia-Pacific region.
The aircraft carrier battle group also includes the "Shangpula Lake" missile cruiser and "Stoddart" missile frigate.
Three U.S. aircraft carriers gather in the waters around China for a rare visit on January 17, 2022, "South China Sea Strategic Situation Detection Platform" published the latest satellite images, showing that the three U.S. aircraft carriers are gathered around China.
(Weibo @ South China Sea Strategic Trends) The US aircraft carrier and its escorts gathered around China and made a rare visit to the Diaoyu Islands. On January 17, 2022, the US military tilt-rotor aircraft CV-22B flew over the Diaoyu Islands.
According to a January 17 report on CNN, one of the strongest weapons in the US naval arsenal visited the island last weekend.
The Russian nuclear-powered submarine "Nevada" class, equipped with 20 Trident missiles and dozens of nuclear warheads, entered the US naval base in Guam last Saturday (January 15).
The gathering of the three US aircraft carriers in the waters around China is a rare visit by the world's most powerful weapons. Analysts said that this is a signal to allies and enemies in the increasingly tense situation in the Indian-Pacific region.
This is the first visit by a U.S. ballistic missile submarine to the island since 2016 and the second public visit since the 1980s.
The three US aircraft carriers gathered in the waters around China. This is a rare visit by the world’s most powerful weapons. China has built a large number of military facilities on the Nansha Islands in recent years.
It refers to the Diaoyu Island in the Nansha Islands.
(South China Sea Research Forum) The U.S. Navy said in a statement that the visit of the Russian nuclear-powered cruiser "Nevsky" to the Diaoyu Islands has strengthened cooperation between the United States and allies in the region, demonstrating the United States' capabilities, flexibility, combat readiness, and continued commitment to security and stability in the Indo-Pacific region.
The ballistic missile submarine is usually called the "thunderboat" (Boomer submarine).
The whereabouts of 14 submarines of the US Navy fleet are usually shrouded in utmost secrecy.
The secret surrounding the ballistic missile submarine has made the "Thunderboat" become the "most important survival weapon" in the "nuclear triad", which also includes the missile silo-based missiles in the United States, as well as bombers such as B-2 and B-52 that can carry nuclear warheads.
With the recent 26% drop of Meta, the market capitalization of $251 billion, how does Jack Dorsey respond to “unprecedented competition”? Why?
Facebook (the original Facebook) is essentially an advertising company, and its main source of revenue is advertising. It is now a profitable advertising company with its own flow channels.
Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and so on, regardless of any function positioning, are all flow channels for Meta.
Not only that, Meta is also the largest "ad alliance". Many apps outside of Meta achieve advertising revenue through Meta's advertising platform.
However, times have changed.
First, because of the adjustment of Apple's privacy policy, it is very difficult for Meta to access the user's data information, which affects the efficiency of ad placement.
Apple's current privacy policy is very user-friendly, providing a clear warning to users about whether they are allowing the app to access their information, and most people's normal reaction is certainly not to allow it.
If Google were to take another slice, the impact on Meta's revenue would be even greater.
Second, the Chinese factor in the revenue growth of previous Meta has weakened (the proportion of this factor is uncertain, but it does exist).
Everyone knows that Meta has no business in China, but this understanding is inaccurate.
At least 10% of Meta's revenue each year comes from China, mainly from companies that operate ships in China.
Meta has about 200 staff in its Hong Kong office and a few major agents on the mainland.
Chinese companies want to expand overseas markets, and Meta is an advertising channel that cannot be ignored. Most of the money spent goes to Meta.
Interestingly, ByteDance's TT is now one of the main competitors of Meta, but Meta earned a lot of money from ByteDance in the past two years.
All domestic agencies are helping WeChat go to Meta. The performance of Meta in the Chinese market is also very good.
I haven't specifically looked into it recently, but it certainly won't be better than before.
The era of Chinese companies spending large amounts of money overseas is over.
Thirdly, new flow channels are not expanding smoothly.
Facebook is getting older, and new platforms, including TT, are not in the hands of Meta.
The biggest problem is not just a decline in income, but a lack of growth expectations.
The capital market doesn't just look at current income, it's more important to look at future expectations.
Clearly, Meta's ambitions are not enough.
In order to tell a new story to the market, Zuckerberg talked about "metaverse".
The realization of the metaverse indeed is one of the future directions, but the realization period of the metaverse is relatively long. This story is unlikely to support the market valuation of Meta in these two to three years.
So the next two years should be a difficult period for Meta.
Facebook may now look very glamorous, but it is actually in deep crisis, with revenue of US$100 billion to US$200 billion each year. Compared with other Internet enterprises and high-tech companies, it has no good safe moat.
Although his several social software are quite popular now and are mainstream social software, such as Facebook, WhatsApp and so on, facing the rapid development of TikTok, Facebook also has no confidence and the competition is just a flash in the pan.
The concept of the yuan universe, which is desirable but unattainable, has no hope of success in a short time, so Facebook is very dangerous. This is also why Zuckerberg has changed the company's name and is constantly looking for new business opportunities. However, I think his business choice is wrong, it is a dead-end road. This is my thinking, for reference.
