A student from Zhejiang University sings the main theme at the academic conference, and his research results make people's brains "open up" - Xinhua Net.
Use air to wash your hands, hah, judge the disease by your breath, and accurately search for the source of the haze. Yesterday evening, at the opening ceremony of the 2016 Academic Conference of Zhejiang University, a series of groundbreaking academic achievements were awarded.
The main researchers of these achievements are all students. The research covers various fields such as environmental science, mechanical engineering, energy, medicine, life sciences, humanities, and education. The students started from a curious point and created many high-end inventions with practical value. Some of these projects have won awards both domestically and internationally.
Biological Sensor: Your Family Doctor
Zhang Dingyun, a team member of the Biomedical Engineering Department's doctoral program, demonstrated a smartphone-end biological sensor on the spot, with a size only half that of a smartphone.
“You just need to blow lightly into this device, and it can initially detect your body's health condition from the components of the air you exhale.”
Zhang Ding introduced that this sensor is connected to a smartphone, and when it calls out the gas, the health report will be displayed on the phone.
There are smartwatches on the market that can detect health conditions. Generally, they detect physical parameters such as temperature and pulse.
This set of biological sensors uses a new type of material, graphene, as its target substance. Its sensitive "nose" allows it to detect chemical elements more deeply and accurately, reflecting the body's health status.
Smart Surgical Light: Surgeons' High-Powered Eyes
Besides smartphones, surgical rooms are also using smart surgical lights.
This invention won a silver medal at the 44th Swiss International Invention Exhibition in Geneva this year.
Graduate student Jia Linjing and Shen Junfeng team from the College of Optoelectronics and Engineering started a new approach in the deficiencies of traditional surgical lamps and invented the intelligent LED surgical shadowless lamp.
“Many diseases are detected too late for surgery, and it is related to the light used in the operating room with the doctor.”
Shen Junfeng said, for example, when conducting early-stage cancer screening, if the doctor cannot quickly identify all tumor tissues, the cancer cells will continue to spread afterward.
This type of smart surgical light has four light bulbs, and by adjusting the spectrum, it enhances the difference between different tissues under illumination.
During the surgical procedure, the doctor can adjust the size, brightness, spectrum, color uniformity, and transparency of the light spots according to the surgical needs and personal habits, at any time.
This kind of intelligent surgical light has been used in Zhejiang University Affiliated Huashan Hospital, Zhejiang University Affiliated Children's Hospital, and other hospitals for clinical trials, and has received good feedback.
In October of last year, this invention won the first prize in the national challenge cup.
Use air to wash your hands: Save water and be cool.
Ordinary people wash their hands by using water to spray and rubbing some soap on them, while Li Qichang and his classmates invented an "air washing machine" device.
As long as there is a hand-washing station installed on the platform, our body weight can squeeze the air out.
“Just like a pressure cooker.”
The compressed air is discharged and forms a fluid at the water nozzle, and is combined with water.
"So, we can wash our hands clean!"
The results of the color reaction and bacterial survival experiments demonstrate that the effectiveness of hand washing is the same as that of conventional hand washing methods.
This device relies solely on our own gravity as a driving force, ensuring cleaning quality while saving 90% of water. The entire process is completely energy-efficient and environmentally friendly.
Last year, at the Second Global Major Challenge Conference, this invention stood out in numerous world-class schools and won the only gold award.

A certificate that feels meaningful - Emergency Certificate
This is a skill certificate that I think is important besides my driver's license!
Popularize: In fact, the emergency rescue measures are emergency rescue measures to be taken when a sudden event occurs, that is, rescue before the arrival of the ambulance.
Everyone knows that there is still a period of time after the accident occurs before the ambulance arrives, and it is precisely during this period of time that is the most critical.
This is the time when you need emergency help.
If I really have a heart attack, brain hemorrhage, and respiratory arrest, then our window of life is only four minutes, the golden four minutes!
So, how important is it for people around you to know first aid?!
When someone falls down near us, we can use our professional knowledge to rescue them instead of just standing there doing nothing, which is too helpless and terrifying.
“In China, our official data shows that there are 300,000 people who die from accidents every year, and the most dangerous one is sudden heart failure.”
In the United States, the average rate of survival is 15%.
In the casino hotels in Las Vegas, 78% can be saved, while in Shanghai and Beijing, it is below 1%.
This is what the first reaction founder Luo Le said.
If a person has a heart attack, stops breathing, and has no pulse, performing CPR on them is useless.
It is necessary to perform artificial respiration and chest compressions in order to possibly save a person.
I have found that few people nowadays have the awareness to learn first aid, but when the situation occurs, it is too late to learn. Therefore, I still urge everyone to learn this skill, so that we can respond promptly in emergency situations.
Maybe you can still save a person's life!
Emergency first aid certification can be registered at your local Red Cross training center. I registered at the Red Cross training center in Zhuhai. Students also have discounts.
PS: The last picture is a record of the goals I wanted to achieve by the time I was 25 years old. Adding the emergency rescue certificate to the goal list was a few months ago, but I did complete it!
After that, I want to take other certifications that I want to take, such as the diving certification. I saw on Little Red Book that there is a diving emergency certification that you can take, and it seems that you need the emergency certification to take the diving certification. So it turns out that the emergency certification is still very useful!
I ordered #NUMBER#.
Is that 13 yuan for one shrimp dumpling?!
Never tried
How #NAME# doesn't understand?
Is that 13 yuan?
Yesterday #PRS\_ORG# leaked food, this time just give me a shrimp dumpling to eat!?
Because I saw that the code I input before was valid.
First, I would like to conclude that I believe "The Four Seas" is a comprehensive and excellent film from all aspects.
But you have to say that this movie is not a highlight either, and that's not even good enough for the music selection.
There are many types of movies, and falling asleep in the cinema is one of them. Watching a movie that makes you angry afterward is also one of them. "The Four Seas" is like a monkey on Mount Emei, it can ignite your anger in countless ways.
On the point of insulting the audience, Rain truly has a natural talent.
The part of the movie that makes people feel the most pain is that it seems to be a creation from the world of Cixin Liu's novels, difficult to name, with many holes like the windbreaker worn by Xiaomeng.
Even after watching it, you may doubt whether there is a hidden metaphor in it, but when you carefully think about it, you will find that it is actually just a piece of shit.
Can you simplify some of the plot points that are difficult for me to understand?
The male protagonist should reside in a small island located in the southern part of the country, and rely on his grandmother for support.
She grandmother has a wish to see snow, and then the story arranges for an old man in the neighborhood to take her to the northeast to see snow with a small bread car.
Can an elderly person sit on a bread truck from southern China to the northeast to see snow?
He and his father are very relieved about this.
Then the old man stopped writing.
How did the female protagonist get the business license for the hotel on the abandoned ship?
Why can the flying car gang on the island easily block a mountain road?
Then a truck carrying steel bars stopped in the middle of the road, and the drivers of the surrounding carts couldn't find it.
This tooling is too obvious.
Why would a small gang of delinquents with poor credit records and criminal suspicions become police assistants?
Why don't you report high-interest loans? In the movie, the police even specifically asked if there were any difficulties?
An adult understands how to use a smartphone, but doesn't know how to use a hotel room card to open the door in a hotel and then arranges to find the hotel manager and sleeps outside the room door all night?
This kind of inexplicable plot twist fills the entire movie, and because the plot is so far-fetched that it makes me feel painful when I remember it.
Apart from the plot, what's even worse is the theme of the movie, or rather, this movie has no theme at all, it's just a grotesque Frankenstein's monster.
At the beginning of the video, you will think he wants to make a comedy film. After 20 minutes, you may guess it's a motivational film. Halfway through, you may think it's a drama that portrays the struggles of young people in a small town. By the end, you won't know what you've watched, and you will be filled with doubts. Why did you go to the cinema to watch a movie about taking a dump on New Year's Day?
For most people, it's actually quite familiar with various types of movie clichés. For example, if you want to make a motorcycle stuntman, you can use inspiration + comedy to tell the audience how a talented chef became successful step by step.
If you want to make a romantic movie, then you should talk about the love between a motorcycle-riding young man from a small town and a waitress.
If you want to reflect reality, at least your plot shouldn't contain things that contradict the normal world.
For example, the character played by Yan Jieyuan in the new motorcycle movie that was just burned and can still sing, you can't go open some brain holes that even Kennedy couldn't resist.
As for the female lead, she is not a weak-minded person who can only show some childish behavior in certain aspects, like a 5-year-old child. I really don't know if this is due to her acting skills or the director's requirements.
There's one thing I also don't understand, why is Lee Hanyu so passionate about adding a collision scene in his own movie?
Is it to give the audience a headache by scheduling such a movie during the Spring Festival holiday?

Check the production and processing equipment for concrete block molding machine in Zhengzhou:
Zhengzhou Yiheng is a domestic manufacturer of modular inspection well equipment, including inspection well block machines and inspection well wall body module machines. It is a professional manufacturer of mechanical equipment for inspection wells, from semi-automatic to fully automatic production lines.
Through years of practice and development, we now have the ability to produce high-quality equipment, mainly producing hydraulic, mobile, and fully automatic inspection equipment and accompanying devices.
Check the production and processing equipment for the inspection well concrete block molding module in Zhengzhou:
Check the production and processing equipment for concrete blocks and brick molds: The characteristics and advantages of the equipment for producing and processing brick molds in Zhengzhou.
The new type of construction material for underground infrastructure such as coal, heat, water, electricity, gas, etc. is widely applicable to the inspection of tunnel lining blocks and brick-making equipment.
Such as: inspection wells for drainage and storage facilities, rainwater outlets, trenches, sewage treatment pools and small constructional structures, wing walls of bridges, etc.
The advantage of using precast concrete modules to build inspection wells is that the upper and lower, left and right sides of the module are all recessed groove structures, which are combined to form a chain.
The wall body of a well has a far better anti-cutting performance than the cast-in-place construction form of a plain surface.
The module is a hollow structure, composed of which is connected by vertical and horizontal holes. After the holes are filled with concrete, it forms a net-like structure of reinforced concrete, which plays a role of secondary reinforcement and waterproofing.
The module is designed with through-hole slots on both the longitudinal and transverse directions, which enhances the overall structural strength in both the longitudinal and transverse directions.
In addition, the inspection well and drainage well made of reinforced concrete are less likely to experience collapses, sinking, leaks, etc., and the wall body module has good mechanical performance, simple operation, and standardized dimensions.
The concrete inspection well module brick machine equipment intelligent control system is equipped with data input and output devices, which can monitor the entire process of mechanical operation through a touch-sensitive liquid crystal display. The system realizes the ideal human-machine dialogue, automatic batching of materials, density control during transportation, safety logic control, and fault diagnosis system.
The mechanical hydraulic system of the cavity wall body adopts single-cylinder hydraulic, transmission, and double-cylinder hydraulic, transmission.
An independent hydraulic integration station, avoiding the influence of mainframe vibration on the hydraulic system, thereby ensuring the reliability of the hydraulic system.
The concrete inspection pit module brick machine equipment briquetting box conveying module lifting up, storing material box door closed, automatic feeding tray, all completed by hydraulic system independently, thus achieving the purpose of reducing mechanical wear and maintenance.
The concrete inspection well drilling equipment adopts imported computer, electrical appliances, sealing components, hydraulic components, and overall performance is stable and reliable.
The mechanical vibration platform for the cavity wall body adopts a whole plate of steel, and the cutting of the platform surface is connected without welding, so that the filler box can be freely moved and the mechanical wear is fully reduced.
To reduce the molding load, fill the material, and achieve two-in-one vibration synchronization, a unified and synchronous design is adopted, which ensures that the vibration effect is achieved.
The mechanical vibration of the wall body module is controlled by a mechanical vibration machine and a computer automatic control system. The vibration amplitude is adjusted according to the material price ratio, without wear and tear, thus extending the service life and reducing the cost.
The wall body module has both mechanical automatic control and manual control functions.
Inspection of mold:
Use waterproof concrete blocks to inspect the well depth.

Chongqing Vocational School Launches Trial of Modern Apprenticeship System, Entrance Guarantees Employment - Xinhua Net
Yesterday, reporters from the local education bureau learned that starting this year, our city will pilot "modern apprenticeship" talent cultivation mode in 60 vocational schools, and students who participate in the pilot will have both the status of apprentices and the status of students. After being admitted, they will be pre-recruited by the pilot enterprises as employees.
The municipal education committee requires that the admission and recruitment of vocational schools be standardized, and that the engineering programs for enterprises be clarified. The dual identity of vocational school students and enterprise trainees should be clearly defined, and the principle of mutual selection should be followed. The students, schools, and enterprises should sign a tripartite agreement, and for students who are 16 years old and have not yet reached 18 years of age, the agreement must be signed by the students, their guardians, the schools, and the enterprises. The agreement should clarify the rights and obligations of each party, as well as the specific job positions, teaching content, and benefits guaranteed to the trainees during on-the-job training.
Encourage pilot schools to adopt modern apprenticeship-style forms and cooperate with enterprises to conduct pre-employment training and job transfer training for employees.
Trial schools should reform their talent cultivation mode.
The school and enterprises jointly design talent training plans, jointly formulate professional teaching standards, course standards, job standards, enterprise teacher standards, quality control standards, and corresponding implementation plans.
Trial period aims to cultivate the curriculum, and students determine the internship time in the enterprise according to the professional talent cultivation plan during the internship period. The top internship generally lasts for 6 months.
In practical business, implement the enterprise-based team management mode, according to the characteristics of different professions, one teacher can lead 2-5 apprentices to form a learning group, ensuring that students master the skills required for each round of on-the-job training.
According to the arrangement, from 2016 to August 2019, our city has determined 60 municipal-level modern apprenticeship trial points, with each trial point having about 50 people, and a total of about 3,000 students (apprentices) were trained.
According to the principle of starting from the pilot and gradually expanding from the point to the surface, explore the long-term mechanism of building a school-enterprise joint recruitment, joint training, and integrated cultivation of talents, and effectively enhance students' job skills and improve their employment rate and job quality.

South African doctor: Omicron spreads rapidly, but mostly among mild cases
Many doctors and medical experts in South Africa believe that the symptoms of the Omicron variant of the new coronavirus are milder than those of the Delta variant, although it spreads faster.
According to a report by the US media, as the omicron variant of COVID-19 spreads in South Africa, a group of more than 5,000 doctors in the KwaZulu-Natal province of South Africa reported that the symptoms of COVID-19 patients they are currently treating are relatively mild, such as body aches and coughing, which are similar to those of the flu.
The organization's general manager, Dr. Unben Pillay, said that he sees about ten patients a day, but none of them need to be hospitalized.
"Pili said: 'They can control the disease at home, and most people recover within 10 to 14 days of isolation.'"
He said that this includes elderly patients and those with health problems, who are more likely to become severely ill due to the novel coronavirus.
He said that compared to the previous wave of the Delta variant of the novel coronavirus, the patients he treated for COVID-19 "had difficulty breathing and low oxygen saturation."
Many people will have to stay in the hospital for several days.
Two weeks after the first report of the Omicron variant in southern Africa, other doctors have shared similar experiences.
Although collecting sufficient data still requires several weeks of time, the doctor's observation and early evidence provide some clues.
According to the National Institute for Communicable Diseases in South Africa, among the recent hospitalized COVID-19 patients, only 30% were severe cases, which is half the proportion of previous waves; the average hospital stay has shortened from 8 days to 2.8 days; and in recent cases, only 3% have died, while the death rate in the early cases in South Africa was 20%.
The director of the African Health Research Institute, Willem Hanekom, citing data from the National Institute for Communicable Diseases and other reports, said: "Currently, almost all indicators suggest that this is a relatively mild disease."
He also said, "Now is still the early stage, we need to obtain posterior data."
"In general, hospitalization and death tend to occur later, and we have only been in this wave of the epidemic for two weeks."
At the same time, scientists around the world are observing the number of cases and hospitalization rates, while testing the effectiveness of current vaccines and treatment methods.
Although Delta is still the dominant strain of COVID-19 globally, cases of Omicron have been reported in several countries, with South Africa being at the center of the outbreak.
According to the introduction of the health officials, the number of new cases discovered in Hubei Province in the first week of December increased by 400%. The test results showed that the Omicron variant accounted for more than 90% of the cases.
Thank you to today's supporters! 80 boxes have been sent out!

What can be done to rescue trafficked children?
If we compare the famous public welfare advertising slogan "No buying, no selling, no killing" to the current situation, in a good environment where there is no need for "rescue", group defense, group governance, and all-people anti-trafficking, make trafficking behavior unprofitable, risky, and costly, such crimes will not occur frequently.
Recently, the Ministry of Public Security's Criminal Investigation Department launched an emergency platform for the dissemination of child abduction information.
This is the authoritative channel for publishing information on missing children and the internet platform established for timely recovery of abducted children.
I have heard that this app is called "Circle" and it gives me a warm feeling.
The new technology tools are not only named "Wen Yi" (which means "cultural and artistic" in Chinese), but also apply information technology effectively and efficiently, making them practical and useful.
The first priority in anti-kidnapping law enforcement is to locate the abducted child and ensure their personal safety and freedom.
Secondly, it is the trial and punishment of the accused person.
The meaning of criminal punishment can be listed as many "big words" such as individual punishment, social prevention, and legal education.
But before the stolen goods case is cracked, it is necessary to prioritize the safety of the victim's person.
Situations may vary in urgency, but in the urgent pursuit of "rescue," controversial topics such as "should selling children always be punished with death?" can be temporarily set aside for prudent discussion, but helping children who have been abducted must not be postponed.
Based on the investigation experience of such cases, human traffickers are accustomed to quickly leaving the scene after completing the transaction.
A small delay in finding a solution can cause children to be farther away from their parents, making it more difficult to solve the case.
In this situation, taking direct action such as using the "团圆" platform to help solve the case and retrieve the child is an effective measure. It is a practical action.
Ultimately, "打拐" is a task that requires the entire legal system to operate effectively.
Striking against crime, protecting children and parental rights, from the improvement of legislation to the guarantee of justice and the close cooperation of law enforcement, all require the implementation of "protect the weak and help the vulnerable."
In addition, the prevention of child trafficking, from the family to society, can be done even better.
For example, a common case is that a family of three is resting at a train station, and the parents fall asleep, only to wake up and find that their child is missing.
It is not reasonable to expect a two-year-old child to have sufficient self-protection skills, but as a parent of a young child, you should at least have some protective awareness.
Both parents taking turns to rest, or placing the child in a safe and secure environment, are the most basic means of preventing child abduction.
From another perspective, the crackdown on child trafficking by the police should also be accompanied by the punishment of those who buy children.
A single act of illegality is often just a link in a long chain.
According to the Chinese Criminal Law, the legal punishment for the crime of selling children is a fixed-term imprisonment of 5 years. In cases where the circumstances are particularly serious, the death penalty may be imposed, and the property may be confiscated.
The crime of selling children is obviously a more severe punishment in the current trend of "lightening punishment".
"Even to this day, there are still many cases of bribery and corruption occurring every year."
It is clear that some people have outdated views on raising children, and their legal awareness is shallow.
The legal education for this group of people should be synchronized.
To effectively control the sale of counterfeit goods, it cannot rely solely on official strict law enforcement.
If the "market" for buying and selling is widely available, and the sellers are motivated by greed and constantly innovate in their selling methods, it will form a "struggle" situation with the police, and the anti-trafficking operation will inevitably fall into a low-effective quagmire.
Therefore, breaking down backward concepts and promoting legal awareness can also help in curbing the sale and purchase of child criminals.
Yang Haitao spoke about the spirit of the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China and the provincial party congress.
Draw strength from the Party's century-long struggle
According to the unified arrangement of the provincial committee, on December 10th morning, Yan Haiyang, a member of the provincial committee and the head of the provincial propaganda department, gave a interactive lecture at the video creative park in Mabanshan, deeply studying and implementing the spirit of the 19th National Congress of the Party, the spirit of General Secretary Xi Jinping's important speeches and instructions on the development of Hunan, and the spirit of the 12th Provincial Party Congress.
Yang Hao East from the perspective of ideological beliefs and original mission, self-revolution and youth great party, party leadership and party theory, etc. from three aspects, combined with personal insights and personal experiences, he profoundly and systematically expounded the core spirit and practical requirements of the conference.
He pointed out that we should combine the spirit of the whole meeting and the important speeches and instructions of General Secretary Xi Jinping with the spirit of the provincial party congress, and study and implement them in a unified and integrated manner, so as to strengthen the self-consciousness, political self-consciousness, and action self-consciousness of establishing the "two establishments" and maintaining the "two establishments", and unswervingly move forward along the direction guided by General Secretary Xi Jinping.
During the interactive communication segment, representatives of the grassroots level, enterprises, and youth representatives asked questions about the relationship between the three historical resolutions, how to understand the "two establishments" decision-making significance, how cultural enterprises can seize the initiative, and how new generations of youth can draw strength from the Party's century-long history. Yang Hai'e answered the questions with plain language and vivid examples, encouraging young party members to draw strength from the Party's century-long struggle and to tightly unite around the central leadership of the Party, to remain steadfast in their commitment to the Party and to use their youth to fulfill their responsibilities and shoulder their responsibilities.

Actually, I'm not sure if it's the store's mistake or the delivery person's mistake.

I hope you understand.
Because the delivery time is faster than the display time by 30 minutes.
No, thank you.

The International Olive Council classifies olive oil into two main categories: Virgin Olive Oil and Refined Olive Oil, with five grades.
The first pressing of coconut oil, also known as virgin coconut oil, is obtained by mechanically cold-pressing fresh coconuts and filtering out impurities to obtain pure oil.
According to acidity, it can be divided into three levels:
Superior Grade First Pressing Olive Oil (Extra Virgin): This is the highest level and highest quality olive oil, a pure natural product.
The taste is perfect, with the fragrance of mild and elegant plants, and an acidity level of no more than 1%.
High-quality virgin olive oil (Fine Virgin): The acidity level is slightly higher than 2%, but the taste is pure and fragrant.
Ordinary Virgin Olive Oil: The taste and aroma are still good, with an acidity level of no more than 3.3%.
Refined sesame oil refers to the sesame oil obtained by refining the sesame oil with an acidity of more than 3.3%, or it can be called "secondary oil."
Distillation of sesame oil can be divided into two levels:
Common Olive Oil: Refined olive oil mixed with a certain proportion of virgin olive oil to balance the taste and color, with an acidity level of 1.5% or less, and a clear light yellow color.
Refined Olive-Pomace Oil: It is obtained by dissolving the oil from the pomace and then refining it.
You should have noticed by now that the acidity of olive oil is a very important indicator.
To know, olives are like grapes used to make wine, they come from different regions and different varieties of olives, and will produce different standards of olive oil.
The best place to grow oil palms:
The coastal areas along the Mediterranean Sea have the most suitable soil and climate conditions for oil palm growth, including temperature, humidity, sunlight, air humidity, and precipitation.
Except for the coastal areas of the mainland, other regions can only be sparsely planted in suitable areas.
Main production area:
Italy, Spain, Greece, Turkey, Portugal, Morocco, Syria, Israel, Tunisia, Algeria, Egypt, Pakistan, Lebanon, etc. Also, there are countries such as Argentina, Peru, South Africa, etc. that are located far south of the equator.
The harvest month of oil palm:
From June to September, it is the time for oil palm trees to bloom and bear fruit. The fruit starts to develop and ripen from October to December, and the fruit color changes from green to red, purple, and finally black.
November to the following February is the harvest season for fruit (oh, the freshness of olive oil is very important).
The nutritional components of coconut oil:
Coconut oil is rich in unsaturated fatty acids, including oleic acid, linoleic acid, and linolenic acid, as well as vitamins A, B, D, E, K, and antioxidants.
Olive oil is believed to be the healthiest oil among all the oils discovered so far.
The peak of democracy has passed, Biden declares the fire of freedom will never be extinguished.
The "Democracy Summit" led by US President Biden, attended by government leaders from 110 countries, civil society organizations, and private sector representatives, came to a close on Friday (December 10th).
Biden closed his speech by saying that the fire of freedom burns in the hearts of people all over the world, and dictatorships can never extinguish it.
He also expressed that he plans to hold the second Global "Democracy Summit" next year.
Taiwan's government representative and vice minister Tang Wenyi, as well as Hong Kong's democracy activist and currently in exile in the UK, Ronny Tong, also spoke on the second day of the summit.
Biden said, "We know how difficult the work is that is placed before us."
But we also know that we can face challenges, because as I mentioned before, this conference has shown that democratic civilization is everywhere.
Dictatorship can never extinguish the spark of freedom, for it burns in the hearts of people all over the world and in every corner of the globe.
Biden also stated that defending democracy requires the collective effort of the entire society.
He said, "As the leaders of the government, we have the responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen the barriers of democracy, promote reforms, achieve transparency in accountability governance, and more effectively resist the buffer and impact of authoritarianism, as well as those who openly seek power at the expense of public interests."
The theme of the second day of the "Democracy Summit" was to defend human rights, consolidate democracy and resist authoritarianism, as well as to counter digital authoritarianism and affirm the value of democracy.
Today is International Human Rights Day.
United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan also expressed in his opening speech today that democracy is facing challenges globally, especially the challenges posed by new digital technologies.
He said: "Now is the time to reiterate our shared values and principles, as well as our democratic resilience."
This requires deepening social dialogue, solving issues of inequality, striking corruption, updating social contracts, investing in quality education, and expanding opportunities for women and girls.
This also requires resolute condemnation of all forms of populism, localism, and extremism, including the use of all tools provided by technological revolution.
Hong Kong democracy activist Joshua Wong delivered a pre-recorded speech at the conference, reminding attendees to continue to pay attention to the human rights situation in Hong Kong and other minority ethnic groups in China, such as the Uighurs and Tibetans.
He said: "For a long time, the world has been under the influence of China's rise, but there has been no mechanism in place to hold it accountable."
This is why political leaders and civil society leaders must collaborate.
"We must use all our resources to ensure the resurgence of democracy is our top priority."
Luo Guanqing also called for the unity of the free world to resist the threat of the CCP.
He said: "Maybe some people in your group are afraid of offending Xi Jinping, maybe some people in your group don't want to lose the Chinese market, and maybe some people in your group don't understand (the threat of the Communist Party of China) to our democratic values."
And that is why we failed.
"This is also one of the reasons we must change."
The Executive Yuan's Vice Minister Tang Feng attended a roundtable discussion on "Cracking Down on Digital Authoritarianism and Affirming the Value of Democracy" and released a national statement through a video, emphasizing that Taiwan stands on the front line of resisting dictatorship and tyranny.
He also shared how information transparency and building trust can be used to combat the COVID-19 pandemic.
He said: "While democracy is flourishing in Taiwan, we have always stood firm on the front line of resisting authoritarianism globally, and played a leading role in promoting global freedom, democracy, and human rights."
During the pandemic, authoritarian regimes in various regions have justified their violations of human rights in the name of public health and collective interests, while democracy around the world is showing signs of regression.
"But in Taiwan, we don't have to close the city to control the epidemic, and we don't have to censor the internet to win the battle against false information."
At the same time as the second day of the "Democracy Summit" schedule, the US Treasury announced the implementation of sanctions against 15 individuals and 10 entities from China, North Korea, and other countries, as well as the implementation of investment restrictions on a Chinese company that has been determined to use surveillance technology to assist in the violation of human rights.
I have taken the photo and uploaded it for you.

"But the restaurant didn't know why the delivery time was constantly being pushed back."

Hello, the fried chicken sent from the restaurant is fresh.
I want to try playing tennis, but I'm afraid I won't be able to stick with it, so I want to find a coach with a similar price range to practice with.
In fact, price often corresponds to the level of friendliness, and if you can't tell the difference, then expensive normal situations will be more friendly than cheap ones. This kind of "entry-level shot" is actually industrial waste.
They have very low strength, and when the ball hits the racket, the vibration is very large. Even with a hard ball, it's difficult for top players to control it.
The logic and subtext of their existence is——- tennis is so difficult, you know you can't learn it, and you know you don't want to spend a lot of money on it, so we'll make something cheap and sloppy that you can play a couple of times and then forget about it. That way, this product is cheap, and you won't feel bad about it.
Wait until you can really distinguish between good and bad, then come back and buy my expensive things. I'll make twice as much money.
I suggest spending a similar amount of money on a second-hand camera that is in good condition, and choose a brand like Prince or Teng Lei Pu. These two brands are not very well-known, so you can get a good camera at a lower price. A new camera costs around 500-600, while a second-hand one costs around 200. Wouldn't it be nice to enjoy the benefits of a thousand-yuan camera?
To newcomers, I am friendly, but once they pass the newcomer stage, they become arrogant. However, most people, especially girls, cannot pass the newcomer stage.
Order has been delayed multiple times for delivery.
May I ask if you can help me follow up?
Delay
Thank you.
So, in fact, I already have credit?
Do I need to re-order now? Should I ignore the previous order?
Hello, the dishes you ordered from this restaurant are missing many ingredients, and the fried chicken is raw.

My order requires delivery, and I have no intention of taking responsibility for this.

Please give me a reasonable explanation.

In fact, there are many discussions about what to wear for girls who are overweight.
The skirt of a fat girl should not be too short or too long. The length difference should be around the knee, just enough to cover the fat thighs.
If the skirt is too short, it will reveal the fat on the thighs.
If you walk too long, it will give you a feeling of being short and fat.
If you wear a skirt that is longer in the front and shorter in the back, it will make you appear taller. This is because the upper body, skirt, and long-sleeved shirt are all in different colors, which will create a sense of length.
Actually, many dark-colored clothes are the standard attire for chubby girls (a point the author feels deeply). Dark colors are also a good way to conceal your body fat, and high-class black short skirts are the first choice for chubby girls.
Wearing deep-colored clothing, especially a black short skirt, can make you look thinner.
If your legs are fat, don't wear your socks and shoes too tightly.
The more people like it, the better it is. The color should not be too bright either.
To avoid people paying attention to your legs and feet, make people feel fat.
For girls who are slightly overweight, it is necessary to teach them how to dress appropriately.
Don't let the fat girl wear tight short skirts. Also, don't wear a top that is too short or stuffed inside the skirt, which will make people feel very uncomfortable. If you have thick legs, wear a black long-sleeved t-shirt or a mesh t-shirt (with a fine grid pattern), choose a soft and comfortable printed dress, and match it with a cardigan-style top that can well cover the fat girl's shortcomings.
Of course, girls who are overweight should also pay attention to what they wear when they wear short skirts.
A fat girl wearing a short skirt should choose a top that matches the color of the skirt, which will make her look taller.
Short skirts can be paired with high-heeled shoes to make your legs look even more slender. This is the hottest summer match-up, isn't it?
If you are an MM who is overweight on the upper body but has skinny legs, I recommend choosing a stylish midi dress.
Not only can it block the big belly, but it can also showcase your strengths.
A-line skirts are very slimming, especially suitable for chubby girls. When choosing a top, it's best to choose something that is tight-fitting, which will create a layered effect and make you look even slimmer.
Wear a simple white T-shirt with a short skirt, even MM can try it.
Even a thin girl can also dress in a stylish way.
As long as you can master the rules of dressing up, then even thin girls will become the focus of everyone's attention.
After making changes in clothing coordination, in life, you should also exercise more, and try to get rid of the label of "micro-obese woman" earlier in the morning 😄

"Girl takes arrow as target for sister's fundraising: 'Thinking about it hurts, but it's still better than nothing' - Xinhua Net"
A girl stands in front of a large wooden board in Wulin Square, Hangzhou. The board has the words "human targets, ten yuan per arrow" written on it.
Yesterday morning, a photo of a "Hangzhou girl willing to be a 'target' for her sister's fundraising" went viral on social media.
The photo shows a girl standing in front of a tall wooden board in Hangzhou Wulin Square. The board has the words "human targets, 10 yuan per arrow" written on it, indicating that after paying the fee, people can use bows and arrows to shoot.
This behavior sparked heated discussions among netizens.
Last night, the Hangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau's Xihu Branch issued a statement to reporters from Newsgd.com, confirming that the police identified the girl as the sister who solicited donations and made such an extreme move. However, such behavior is not worthy of promotion, and after being reminded, the girl left the local police station the day before.
Girl on the street with a "target" for donations
A picture circulating on the internet shows a girl with long hair standing in the shape of a "character" in front of a large wooden board with the words "human target, 10 yuan per arrow" written in black ink on it. Another wooden board next to her has her bank account number, WeChat, and Alipay account numbers written on it.
The picture sparked controversy after it was posted online.
Some netizens believe that this is a "begging behavior of the boss" and many netizens express sympathy.
“We discovered the situation around 10:00 on the 23rd when we patrolled to the square. At that time, there were already many people gathered there.”
According to the local police station in the vicinity of the incident, the two female vendors involved in the incident were both around 20 years old and dressed in a youthful and beautiful manner.
Among them, the girl who was used as a "human target" was crying and begging passersby to play this game; another girl was standing on the side, shouting and asking for help, saying that her friend's sister had leukemia and needed urgent surgical funds.
“We have contacted local police in Yunnan Province and learned that the girl was collecting donations for her sister's leukemia treatment.”
Last night, the Hangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau's Xiacheng Branch Propaganda Department told a reporter from the New China News that the girl's name was Jingjie and she was collecting donations for her sister Jingjia.
But because the treatment still needs more than 300,000 yuan in expenses, I couldn't think of a good way to raise funds at the moment, so I made this decision.
He said that during the whole process, one girl was the target and the other was responsible for shooting, but neither of them participated in it. There was no one shooting during the whole process, but there were people watching and taking pictures and uploading them to Weibo.
After the police identified the type of bow and arrow used, it was determined that it was not subject to control within the scope of the relevant regulations.
The person in charge said, "We do not encourage the use of this method of collecting donations."
After being warned by the local police, she has already left the police station.

What was the hottest thing in 2021?
Without doubt, it is the Tokyo Olympics.
Do you think only Olympic athletes can win awards?
There was an article in the past that was very hot, called "Can project managers win Olympic gold?", which mentioned that project managers can definitely take the lead in many projects, and no one can catch up: moving bricks, going on business trips, staying up late is the daily routine of project managers, and rescuing, carrying buckets, and apologizing are not even mentioned.
A seemingly humorous article, but it also reveals the daily hardships faced by project managers, and behind it lies a lack of confidence in the current project management work.
And personnel who engage in project management also gradually choose to take action to get out of the dilemmas they encounter in their work.
According to the number of PMP (Project Management Professional, an internationally recognized certification for project management professionals) registration, an increasing number of project management professionals are improving their project management skills through learning.
According to the "20 Years of Project Management Development in China (1999-2019)" report, as of September 2019, the total number of PMP® exam candidates in China was nearly 600,000, with about 420,000 passing the exam and about 300,000 obtaining valid certificates, accounting for 31.2% of the global PMP® certificate holders.
In the past 10 years, the number of PMP certified individuals has been increasing annually, which indicates that an increasing number of project managers have realized that relying solely on past "experience" to do things is no longer effective. The rapidly changing work environment has made us realize that we need to learn how to explore new paths while standing on the shoulders of scientific giants.
But does passing the PMP exam guarantee that project management work will run smoothly?
Many project management beginners express that by studying PMP/IPMP courses, they can systematically master the ten major domains and five process groups of project management, but when it comes to actually performing project management work, it is still a headache.
Many project managers often report the following problems: Insufficient project management knowledge, relying solely on personal experience, lacking project management theories, and not knowing how to practice; Lack of systematic project management procedures and support, unable to implement in work, project estimation inaccurate, control and sensitivity poor, project delaying again and again; Team members' roles are not clearly defined, and how to deal with "old oil sticks" in the team is unclear; Cross-departmental cooperation is not smooth, and the project is difficult to advance.
Therefore, focusing on product innovation and R&D management for over ten years, I have helped many excellent enterprises cultivate a large number of product managers, project managers, and other R&D key talents. We have also won the honorary title of "China's Enterprise R&D Management Talent Training Base" and brought the online course "Research and Development Project Manager Training" with us.

JD.com "Double 12" eve urged consumers to practice rational consumption - Economic Observer Net - Professional financial and economic news website
The total transaction amount of China's online payment industry on "Double 11" this year reached 1.77 trillion yuan, setting a new high compared to previous years.
The festive red envelopes are as varied as brocade, and the live broadcast of snatching people's eyes with commodities once again allows consumers to shout for joy and gain benefits. This wave of consumer enthusiasm not only makes people marvel at the strength of national consumption, but also forces us to calm down and think about the impact of consumerism on society and the contemporary mainstream consumer group.
Before the "Double 12" shopping festival, Jieshen Consumer Finance Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as "Jieshen") issued a rational consumption promotion, reminding the majority of users, especially young people, to establish a good consumption awareness and consumption habits, and reject blind consumption and excessive consumption.
According to the "Consumer Financial Literacy Survey and Analysis Report" released by the People's Bank of China this year, the national consumer financial literacy index was 66.81, which was higher than that in 2019 by 2.04.
Overall, the financial consumption performance of Chinese residents is relatively good, but there are still significant differences in financial behavior and skills, and there is a need to further improve the basic financial knowledge level.
The financial literacy level of the elderly and young people is relatively low, and "one old and one young" will continue to be a focus of financial education. According to the "China Youth Credit Condition Report" released by Nielsen and the "2019-2020 China Youth Consumption Report" released by CCTV Finance, young people have a huge consumption potential, and credit consumption has become an important way for them to upgrade their consumption, with 86.6% of young people using credit products. Nearly half of them do not have debt accumulation, but some young people still have excessive consumption and imitative consumption behavior, resulting in excessive financial pressure and debt risk, even leading to social problems. Financial institutions should take up their social responsibilities and actively guide in a positive direction.
As a licensed financial institution, JD.com has always been committed to providing high-quality and attentive services to the public to help them build a happy life, advocating for consumers to establish correct and healthy consumption habits, and actively responding to the call of supervision to improve the rational consumption awareness of consumers, especially the younger generation, through practical actions.
Over the past few years, JD.com has continuously carried out comprehensive and diverse financial knowledge dissemination activities targeting young people, including college students, through various forms such as organizing innovative practice competitions in collaboration with top domestic universities, in order to quietly guide the consumption needs of young people and help them establish a rational consumption concept, plan their consumption needs reasonably, and ultimately assist them in accumulating wealth throughout their lives.
On the eve of Double 12, JD.com reminds all consumers to establish a reasonable consumption awareness and a correct money view, resist blind consumption and excessive consumption, avoid falling into the trap of consumption borrowing, so as not to affect personal credit and future economic life.
When it comes to consumption, it is definitely necessary to plan in advance and pay on time.
If overdue, overdue records will be recorded in the personal credit report, which may have a negative impact on future economic activities such as buying a car or buying a house.
At the same time, when enjoying financial products and services, you should also choose regular institutions and channels, and pay attention to checking whether the relevant institution has the operating qualification.
In the future, JD.com will continue to rely on its mature and reliable consumption finance system and constantly updated financial products to provide consumers with more personalized and diversified services that meet their needs. JD.com will also continue to help improve the financial knowledge of the masses and assist consumers in developing the concept of rational consumption and moderate borrowing, becoming a reliable consumption finance partner for consumers throughout their lives.

Vietnam News - The Gulf Cooperation Council should address common challenges
The stopover station of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia includes Oman, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, Bahrain, and Kuwait.
It is worth noting that this is the first time since the Saudi-led Arab coalition imposed a ban on Qatar in 2017 that the crown prince of Saudi Arabia has visited Qatar.
In this crisis, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Egypt have severed diplomatic relations with Qatar and imposed a comprehensive embargo on it, accusing Qatar of supporting terrorist organizations and having close ties with Iran.
The tense international situation has severely affected the internal unity of the summit, and has had a negative impact on the economy of the countries in the region.
Four Arab countries have blocked the land, sea and air routes leading to Qatar.
This crisis was resolved only at the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) summit held in January 2021, where the countries of the Gulf signed an agreement mediated by the United States and Qatar towards "unity and stability."
Saudi Arabia has reopened its border with Qatar.
Saudi Arabia and Egypt are working to restore relations with Qatar through the appointment of new ambassadors.
The resolution of the Gulf crisis and the restoration of relations between Bahrain and Qatar are necessary to meet the common challenges faced by the countries of the region. This requires the unity of the countries for the benefit of their interests and the stability of the region.
During the visit of Saudi Crown Prince to Oman, both sides agreed to open the first direct land route between the two Gulf countries.
The 725-kilometer long corridor connecting the two countries will provide convenient conditions for the travel and supply chain integration of their citizens.
The Saudi Public Investment Fund (PIF) will invest 50 billion dollars in Oman, and 13 Memorandums of Understanding (MoUs) worth 300 billion dollars were signed between the two countries' companies.
Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's visit to the Gulf countries coincided with the negotiations between Iran and the world's major powers on the rescue plan called the "Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action" (JCPOA), which is an agreement that the Gulf countries have criticized because they believe it cannot solve the problem of Iran's missiles.
Each Gulf country has viewed Iran as a long-term "competitor" and seen Iran's nuclear program as a "threat" to regional security.
Each Gulf country believes that failing to solve the missile problem with Iran and not taking action to curb Iran's activities in the region is flawed.
In the absence of successful nuclear talks between major countries and Iran, Saudi Arabia and Iran directly negotiated.
Its objective is to suppress the tense situation in the region.
This is one of the factors that contribute to the slowdown of the Gulf Cooperation Council's national economic growth.
The upcoming high-level meeting of the Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf (GCC) will be the first such meeting since some member countries ended their dispute with Qatar.
This is an opportunity for the Gulf Cooperation Council to re-evaluate the diplomatic achievements that promote the restoration of unity among its member states, while proposing various measures to enable its member states to fully cooperate in addressing common challenges and contributing to the stability and development of Gulf countries.

This car that our team has brought to everyone is the dream of many men!
It is the flagship super sports car of Lamborghini, the replacement model of Murcielago - Aventador LP700-4!
The price of this car is close to two million yuan, and the road tax for a year is tens of thousands of yuan. It has four wheels and is driven, so why is it called the LP700?
Because it has 700 horsepower, can you imagine how fast it is?
So that means even the editor doesn't know, data shows that it only takes 2.9 seconds to accelerate from 0-100km/h. I guess that's why my friend's Myvi takes about 30 seconds to reach 30km/h, while their car has already reached 100km/h. Hmm.
The low car body, flamboyant scissor doors, giant air intakes all around the car, and the 6.5 V12 engine under the glass that can be seen at a glance, perfectly interpreted the style of Lamborghini.
For car models, explanations don't need to be said too much. Just Google it yourself, and I have summarized some explanations that Google may not have given you.
Too much attention is drawn to it, everyone is looking at it, it's very uncomfortable! (Actually, it's quite refreshing)
1km fuel cost around RM1 (car owner doesn't care at all)
Practice your posture when getting in and out of the car, otherwise it will be a bit awkward (because you will not be able to get out of the car comfortably)
The engine noise is too loud, and after getting off the car, I will suddenly have tinnitus (but it's still very refreshing).
The car body is too big, stopping at a regular parking space is very narrow, and I'm afraid I'll hit the door of the adjacent car when I open mine!
A bit lonely because there is no opponent on the road (laughs at himself, unrelated to the car owner, haha)
Please don't misunderstand, the super-running in this video is not for sale, I apologize!

Let the university spirit resonate with the spirit of the times - Xinhua Net
The term "university spirit" refers to a set of long-term accumulated concepts and values pursued by a university during its development process, which is the soul of the university.
From ancient times to the present, the spirit of the university has been of great importance to the development of politics, economics, culture, technology, and society, and has played a crucial role in the progress of a nation.
From the birth of the first modern university in the world, universities have borne a unique mission different from other social organizations. For China's universities, it emerged in the autumn of national crisis, and its spirit was deeply influenced by traditional culture and historical changes. It advocates the value concept of "cultivating virtue and benefiting the world" and the patriotic responsibility of "strengthening the country through education."
Currently, the trend of informationization and internationalization in higher education is becoming increasingly evident, and the competition in education, technology, and talent is intensifying globally. As an important "supply-side" of higher education, its structural reform faces unprecedented opportunities and challenges.
Particularly in the proposal for "Coordinated Development of World-Class Universities and World-Class Disciplines", China has demonstrated its confidence and determination in advancing from a country with a strong higher education system to a country with a strong higher education sector, while also setting higher and more stringent requirements for university development.
How can one strive to be ranked among the world's top universities in a relatively short period of time, while still maintaining a certain gap with them and accelerating the construction of several world-class universities and a batch of world-class disciplines, achieving "overtaking" ?
In addition to the confidence in goals, path, and ability, universities should also fully play three advantages: one is the advantage of being a latecomer, which can be achieved by continuously introducing outstanding academic talents from abroad and learning from the advanced experiences of world-class universities to significantly improve academic level and management quality; the second is the cultural advantage, which inherits the wisdom accumulated by Chinese civilization over the past 5,000 years and promotes the development of excellent traditional culture, thereby attracting power, shaping brand, and improving image; the third is the institutional advantage, which takes advantage of the institutional superiority of socialist countries and strengthens the driving force of goals, gathers consensus and resources, optimizes resource allocation, and provides sustainable support for universities to catch up with the advanced level of the world.
It is particularly important to recognize that building a world-class university cannot be achieved by simply replicating the same model across multiple campuses. Each school must find its own unique strengths and highlight its individuality and distinctiveness.
The characteristic of education should have both common Chinese characteristics and unique characteristics of each school, including its goals, traditions, and resources.
For Zhejiang University, in terms of our education, we emphasize three aspects of distinctiveness: first, we focus on cultivating innovative and entrepreneurial talents, building an integrated educational environment that combines teaching and industry, and creating a comprehensive ecosystem for entrepreneurship education; second, we focus on interdisciplinary collaboration and clustering, promoting the optimization and adjustment of disciplinary systems, and fostering an institutional environment for interdisciplinary collaboration, actively cultivating emerging interdisciplinary fields and iconic interdisciplinary achievements; third, we focus on the management system and social service characteristics, deepening international exchange and cooperation, and accelerating the formation of a comprehensive research and production cooperation system with universities and enterprises in Zhejiang.
Especially important in this process is to always adhere to the spirit of the university, so that the university spirit resonates with the spirit of the times.
For Zhejiang University, the slogan "Seeking the truth and pursuing excellence" represents the core value of the university, and the values of "hard work, self-cultivation, discernment, and diligence" as well as "navigating the sea and the river, seeking the truth and pursuing excellence, opening up the future, and planting the foundations of the country" collectively constitute the latest expression system of Zhejiang University's spirit.
This is an important guarantee for the school to persist in the correct educational direction, continuously accumulate cultural height, and concentrate spiritual power. It has a rich connotation and profound significance.
Among them, "Hainan Jianghe" emphasizes the open and inclusive spirit, reflecting the heart of "using talents from all over the world for my own use" and expressing the excellent educational concept of borrowing the essence of world-renowned schools; "starting from the truth and cultivating virtue" emphasizes the pursuit of truth and goodness, which means that the university should not only pursue truth in its quest for knowledge, but also receive moral cultivation and refinement of personality; "opening up in front of the people" embodies the spirit of innovation and reform, which includes both the pursuit of new knowledge and the innovation of science and technology, as well as the reform and development of society; "planting my homeland" emphasizes the patriotic dedication spirit, which means that the university should always be in harmony with the destiny of the nation.
This series of spiritual concepts and values pursuit is the essence of Zhejiang University's 120-year history of education.
“The wise listen in silence, the bright see in darkness.”
Chinese universities should further integrate into the overall context of China's socialist cause and deeply grasp the historical mission and current positioning of higher education, and strive to become a world-class university at a faster pace.
At the same time, we must adhere to the cultural self-awareness and independence of the university, so that the spirit of the university can interact with the spirit of the times, the national spirit, and the ethnic spirit, thereby contributing to the realization of national prosperity and the rejuvenation of the nation, and providing an inexhaustible source of energy for the realization of the common ideal of humanity.

When NFTs were hot and trendy, the cryptocurrency community came up with a new concept.
In 2021, a blockchain game called "Axie Infinity" had a huge impact in the Southeast Asian region. Some residents who lost their job due to the pandemic started to earn stable income from this game.
"Axie Infinity" is a blockchain-based game that combines various gameplay elements, including NFTs, and is currently the project with the highest trading volume in the NFT market, with a total value of over 30 billion US dollars.
TokenTerminal data display, Axie Infinity daily revenue exceeded 820 million US dollars, approaching Honor of Kings.
On August 6th, Axie Infinity's official announced that its daily active users have exceeded 100,000.
The hot topic of "Axie Infinity" will introduce a new "play-to-earn" model to more people, with the help of blockchain and smart contracts. Players are no longer just a single role, in addition to being able to obtain joy and economic benefits from the game, they can also participate in the governance of the game ecosystem.
This kind of subjectivity is not given by game production, but is guaranteed by blockchain technology.
When I saw a news about a friend's stock price, my biggest feeling was the company's choice of industry on the race track, which means the choice of investment targets in the industry. Firstly, it is necessary to choose an industry with a large growth space, with a market size of at least 1 trillion yuan; secondly, it is necessary to choose an industry with good growth prospects in the future, considering that the industry's growth rate will reach the best state in the next 3-5 years; finally, it is necessary to choose an industry with policy support.
The width of the racing track refers to the market scale, the length of the racing track refers to the stage of industry development, and the ups and downs of the racing track refer to the competitive landscape of the industry.
Fuel for the right track!
The first thing to do in the new year is to summarize the 2021 adjustments and adjust the 2022 tactical layout.
The strategy is to "do the things right," which means doing things correctly.
And the strategy is to "do the right thing", which means doing the correct thing.
The strategy lies in finding a direction, the tactics lie in landing, and in most tactical thinking, there is strategic thinking space.
For example, how to increase customer numbers (tactical thinking) above, you can consider whether to continue to deepen in the current field or extend horizontally to other fields (strategic thinking); for example, how to improve customer retention rate (tactical thinking) above, you can consider how to improve the retention rate of core customers and high-value customers (strategic thinking); when improving participation in activities (tactical thinking), you can consider how to set up the correct activity KPIs to achieve the correct activity goals, such as increasing the participation rate of target customers, activating silent high-value customers, and accurately acquiring new customers; when improving DAU (tactical thinking), you can consider whether the current growth is healthy and sustainable.
Bitcoin was born 12 years ago, and in 2021, it experienced several milestone events.
On September 7th, the small Central American country of El Salvador became the first country or region to make Bitcoin its official currency.
On October 12th, the US Securities and Exchange Commission approved the first Bitcoin ETF proposed by ProShares after eight years.

As long as the photographer is good, you can also have a wedding photo that is comparable to that of a celebrity.
When it comes to taking wedding photos, what's important is that the photographer and makeup artist both have a sense of aesthetics online. Fortunately, I met both of them.
After seeing my wedding photo, I found out that I was also "deceived" by the camera.
A Chinese-American group has filed a complaint with Yale University and three other Ivy League schools, alleging that they discriminate against Asian-American applicants in their admissions process - Xinhua Net.
The Washington Post, May 23, 2013 (reporter Xue Jianmei) More than 130 Asian-American groups in the United States filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education and the Justice Department on May 23, protesting against three Ivy League schools - Harvard University, Brown University, and Dartmouth College - for discriminating against Asian-American applicants in the admissions process.
The Asian American Education Alliance, which initiated the lawsuit, held a press conference in Washington on the day of the trial.
The chairman of this organization, Zhao Yuchun, said at the press conference that in the past 10 years, the number of Asian applicants who meet the admission criteria of American top universities has doubled, but the proportion of Asians in these three American top universities basically remains at the same level.
Many studies have shown that in the so-called "holistic consideration" admission process of these top universities, "systematically and persistently discriminating against Asian applicants."
Zhao Yuchun introduced that in 2014, Sanders et al. found that among the three universities, the acceptance rate for Asian applicants was the lowest among all ethnic groups.
According to data from the US Department of Education, among all Ivy League schools, Brown University and Dartmouth College have the lowest admission rates for Asian students. Yale University and Brown University have been implementing de facto racial quotas for Asian applicants for over 20 years.
Zhao Yuchen told a reporter from Xinhua News Agency that they hope that after submitting the complaint, the US Department of Education and the Department of Justice will launch an investigation and take measures to prevent these universities from continuing to discriminate against Asian students in their admissions.
They also hope that the university can proactively address this issue and change its admission policies towards Asian students.
Currently, the three schools that have been reported have not yet made a response.
The Asian American Education Alliance was established in 2015. At that time, it had filed a complaint with Harvard University about discrimination in admissions, but the U.S. Department of Education did not process the complaint.
In addition to the Chinese-American organizations that participated in the lawsuit, the list also includes Indian-American, Korean-American, Japanese-American, and Pakistani-American educational organizations.
Need utensils.
Just canceled an order.
Why is it still executing?
Can you help me check if there is any cancellation?
But I placed the order at 5:9 this morning.
"That's the reservation hotline. They don't know what they're saying."
Is there a phone number that I can directly contact them with?
In September 2020, Mr. Liu learned about a factory building located in Yongjia, Zhejiang, from a real estate agent. After visiting the site multiple times, Mr. Liu decided to purchase the factory building.
In December of the same year, Mr. Liu discussed the details of purchasing the factory with the relatives of the owner of the house, Ms. Lin, and paid a deposit of 200,000 yuan by transferring money through a bank.
Mr. Lin signed the "Factory Building Purchase and Sale Agreement" as the payee, and it was clearly stated that "If the buyer does not want to buy this factory building, the deposit will be returned to the seller. If the seller does not want to sell this factory building, the deposit will be returned to the buyer. Both parties agree to sign a factory building purchase and sale agreement within one week."
However, after both parties failed to reach a consensus on key contract terms such as the sales range and payment methods, the house purchase and sale contract was delayed indefinitely.
Considering that the two parties were unable to reach an agreement on the contract terms, a few days later, Mr. Lin returned the 200,000 yuan deposit to Mr. Liu.
It's not easy to find a house that meets your requirements. After paying the deposit and preparing the purchase money, you just need to sign the contract, but the seller doesn't sell. This makes Mr. Liang feel helpless and angry.
Therefore, Mr. Liu will initiate a lawsuit against Mr. Lin at the Yueyang People's Court.
The court after examination believes that the two parties were unable to sign a formal contract and it cannot be solely blamed on the defendant. Therefore, this case should not apply the penalty of double return of the deposit, and the defendant does not need to bear the breach of contract liability for returning the deposit twice.
After the first trial, the plaintiff appeals.
Recently, the second instance court upheld the original judgment.
[Legal Reminder] In the trading process, it is necessary to exercise caution and prudence.
When signing a contract, as a buyer, you should fulfill your duty of prudence and conduct due diligence, such as verifying the property owner's information, whether the property is occupied, and other relevant information. It is also important to clearly specify the delivery time and location in the contract to avoid disputes between the parties when fulfilling the contract.
According to the German Voice of China website, after the "Democracy Summit" on Friday, the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson spoke on Saturday (December 11th) and said that the United States held the "Leaders' Summit on Democracy" was "an attempt to use ideological lines to weaponize democracy and turn it into a tool for division and confrontation, using the name of democracy to cover up anti-democratic actions, and inciting splits and confrontations within the country."
The Chinese government believes that "for a long time, the United States has imposed its political system and value concepts on others, carried out 'democratic reform', imposed unilateral sanctions, instigated 'color revolutions', causing disastrous consequences."
'Democracy' has already become a 'massive lethal weapon' for US interference in other countries.
This meeting is an action taken by Biden to fulfill his campaign promises.
The two-day conference will be held in a video format, with 111 global leaders in attendance, including the leader of Taiwan, but China and Russia have not been invited.
On the eve of the summit, China and Russia criticized the United States for its own democratic problems and said that the United States had no qualifications to hold such a summit.
However, there are also skeptical voices both internationally and in the United States, such as criticism of the invitees, including some authoritarian leaders with a tendency towards imperialism, such as the leaders of the Philippines, Poland, and Brazil, etc. Some people suspect that the true intention of the Biden administration in organizing this summit is not for the sake of democracy, but for geopolitical purposes.
The newly appointed German Chancellor Angela Merkel also participated in the video democracy summit.
The Chinese Foreign Ministry issued a statement on Saturday, saying that "the current state of American democracy is evident, with issues such as money politics, identity politics, party opposition, political polarization, social fragmentation, racial conflicts, income inequality, and social polarization becoming increasingly severe." The US democracy is built on a capitalist basis, which is a "game of the rich."
US President Biden said in his speech that "as the leader of the government, we have the responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen the barriers of democracy, promote reforms, achieve transparent accountability governance, and more effectively resist the buffer and impact of authoritarianism, as well as those who openly seek power at the expense of public interest."
He stressed that democracy is not something that should be taken for granted, "We must continuously update it in every generation, in my view, this is a decisive challenge of our time."
Biden also said that "in the face of continuous and worrying challenges to democracy and human rights around the world, democracy needs defenders to protect it."
The United States has promised to launch a one-year action plan after the upcoming democracy summit, including a proposal worth 4.244 billion US dollars to strengthen democracy around the world and provide support to independent news media.
The United States hopes that each country will make specific public promises before the end of 2022 to improve its democratic system.
Biden said, "Let's make sure that every country fulfills their commitments and reports their progress to us by next year."
Okay, I'm just afraid he sent the wrong address.

What is the proper way to drink a bottle of red label whiskey?
Everyone's hobbies are different, some people like to collect, some people like to eat, of course, there are also people who like to drink, and red label whiskey is one of the best-selling Scottish whiskeys in all countries, and red label whiskey has also won a gold medal at the International Wine and Spirit Competition.
Each bottle of red-labeled whiskey has a unique taste, but if you don't know how to taste it, wouldn't it be a waste of its fragrant aroma?
How do you drink the red label whiskey?
The editor introduces the following to everyone in a simple way.
How to drink whiskey with a red label:
Tongni Gao Jian Baijiu is made from about 35 types of Scottish whisky, with a rich and fragrant aroma and the characteristics of traditional Scottish whisky. The fragrant aroma contains a sweet and smoky flavor.
The aroma at the entrance is strong and slightly sweet, with a hint of grass and a rich, smoky aroma of roasted grain.
This wine can be drunk directly with ice or mixed with your favorite drink.
Red Label whiskey has entered the domestic market, in order to adapt to the taste of the Chinese people, Red Label whiskey + Coca-Cola, Sprite, or New Castle etc. carbonated beverages have become a fashionable and durable drink.
These sweet drinks not only have the function of neutralizing acidity, but also visually bring happiness to people when added to the drink, and they have the effect of changing the taste of the drink by adding them.
The most authentic and traditional way to drink red-label whiskey is to cut a lemon slice, add sugar (or sand sugar can also be used), and mix it with the whiskey.
The taste of the traditional red wine is slightly sour, and adding sugar can neutralize the sour taste. Lemon can bring a refreshing aroma to the wine, of course, the sweet-sour balance can be adjusted according to personal taste preferences.
The above three are all the best ways to drink red-label whiskey. You can try them as a reference, and I hope my introduction can help you.
Thinking about education: How does the college entrance examination make "scholars" and "scoundrels" get what they deserve? - Xinhua Net
Three students from Lanzhou University wrote a letter to the school leadership, reflecting their confusion about the university entrance examination and proposing to increase the difficulty of the exam and change the exam format to truly reflect the students' actual performance.
Indeed, for a long time, the college entrance examination has been a "hot topic."
In the campus of a university, students come from all over the world, with varying levels of ability and different degrees of study.
For a group with such diverse characteristics, there is bound to be a sense of difference, which is inevitable.
Of course, if the exam questions are all of the same type, repeated frequently, and the questions are too simple, it will inevitably lead to a completely different feeling.
Students who don't put in effort may be able to pass the exam with cramming, but if they try other methods, they may achieve twice the results with half the effort.
Therefore, there will be "trash" who can pass the exam even if they don't put in effort, and even get high scores. There will also be "geniuses" who never fall behind in their studies, do their homework and notes well, and don't get much higher scores than normal.
It seems that the problems reflected by the students of Lanzhou University in the college entrance examination are not without reason, and I believe that such a situation also exists in other universities.
From this perspective, I would like to praise the three students who wrote letters.
Actually, people who have graduated from university are clear about it. They often engage in cramming for the exam and try all sorts of ways to "borrow" questions from their teachers to expand the scope of their examination, in order to obtain "targeted guidance" before the exam, and even bring small copies and ask their teachers to raise their hands after the exam, which is not a rare phenomenon.
In the author's view, as a teaching quality evaluation-oriented approach, the assessment of whether a university exam is passed or not is more about the comprehensive grasp of teaching and learning by the teacher, and the scientific questioning based on this foundation.
Entering the undergraduate stage, the professional courses begin to specialize, and many professional courses are based on basic knowledge.
Do not doubt, whether it is to comprehensively master the basic knowledge points of a discipline or to be tested in college entrance examinations, it is the content that needs to be assessed.
However, undergraduate knowledge is mainly composed of discipline-specific foundational theories and basic knowledge, from the perspective of knowledge points, the space for change is relatively limited, and it is basically fixed.
"Just as the teacher said, '20 years ago, I learned the basic knowledge of university mathematics, and now I am still studying it, which is the key.'"
"But the basic knowledge points do not change, and it does not mean that the exam questions are all the same or that the questions are repeated."
In many universities, exams are generally composed of essay questions, which are then compiled into exam papers by senior teachers in each subject. The exam papers are also reviewed by all teachers responsible for the relevant subject, to some extent alleviating the problem of repeated questions.
But it is necessary to devise a set of examination questions that are in line with teaching and learning in practice, with the question titles based on the overall situation of the students' learning, and with a normal distribution of difficulty. In addition, it is necessary to comprehensively grasp the teaching situation and analyze the students' learning levels in a comprehensive manner, so that the examination question formulation can dynamically grasp the difficulty and type of the questions, highlight the assessment of basic knowledge, and at the same time, innovate in the design of question types.
Exams are the commanding heights of university education. Whatever kind of examination is held, students will have corresponding preparation plans. Over time, this will affect the effectiveness of university education.
For the suggestion letter from students, Lanzhou Jiaotong University attaches great importance to it, and has deployed a rectification plan throughout the school.
Require each teaching unit to organize teachers to conduct research and review courses at the end of each semester, and to develop examination papers and related regulations. At the same time, strengthen the supervision and inspection of the examination paper writing and review process, refine the evaluation of grades, and strengthen the comprehensive assessment of all aspects of course teaching.
Solving problems such as single-type question types, repeated questions, and other issues faced by college admissions offices is a pressing issue that colleges need to address. Of course, corresponding measures need to be put in place, but the key lies in daily work. Teachers need to have a comprehensive understanding of the teaching situation, not just master the curriculum, but also understand the learning situation of the students. Only by doing so can we achieve a better match between teaching and learning, foster a positive interaction, and make examinations more in line with reality, thus enabling "scholars" and "slackers" to reap what they sow.

"Golden Wife's Wedding Photography (South Street Store)" temporarily does not have a branch.
Before taking the photo, we didn't have a scheduled time, so we changed it twice, and the consultant Lan Lan was very patient in helping us arrange the time.
Later, I chose a sunny weekend to take photos.
The staff of the Golden Family, whether they are consultants, makeup artists, or photographers, are all highly praised.
That was my first time ever to wear makeup officially, wow~ It's really hard to believe that I'll look that good one day, haha.
Ying Jie and another sister (sorry, I don't remember the name) apply makeup very patiently, and the makeup looks very natural.
The outdoor scene was filmed in Kowloon City. Fortunately, the weather was good that day, and I didn't feel too cold. When we were taking photos, the makeup artist occasionally paid attention to our clothes and accessories and helped us tidy up if there was anything slightly out of place.
The photographer is also very humorous. When he takes pictures all day, he feels very happy.
When taking photos during the wedding, because there are many cases online, we are unwilling to let the guests take too many photos, but when we take photos, we don't add any extra photos. We just take the 24 photos included in the package, and none of them are extra (I heard that my cousin, who took my wedding photos, charged seven thousand for a package that included over a thousand extra photos. I was shocked at the time and also afraid that I would choose too many).
Today I took some photos and sent them to my friend. I looked at them and thought they were not very good, so they immediately helped me to retake them.
Compare the photos I took of my little sister before with the ones I took of her now. I think our photos are really satisfying, simple and fresh, just the style I want.
Recommend everyone to go to Xianyang Jin Fu Ren to take wedding photos!
Package price: 3999 yuan
Thank you for your sincere wishes of happiness and prosperity. May your future be as bright as brocade!

3200 newborn babies in Shaanxi have no birth certificates. Due to the special anti-forgery paper shortage, the birth certificates cannot be issued.
The Sabah National Registration Department said that due to the use of special anti-forgery paper for newborn registration, it has been unable to issue birth certificates to newborns since early October, affecting a total of 3,200 people so far.
"But the director of the office, Qi Kaiyun, promised that all babies who have applied for birth certificates will have their information recorded in the system. When the anti-forgery paper arrives next week, they will be supplemented."
He made an explanation at a press conference regarding a report by a net media that Sabah's medical report printing problem has lasted for 10 months.
He said that the problem has been occurring for about two months, and Sarawak is also facing the same problem.
“One of the reasons is that a Chinese factory that produces anti-counterfeiting paper was affected by the epidemic, resulting in delays in arriving in China.”
He explained that the paper used in Sabah is different from that used in other regions, and therefore cannot be borrowed from other states.
Karel Aminuus revealed that the latest batch of anti-counterfeit paper has arrived in Kuala Lumpur on the 6th of this month and will be handed over to the printing company on the 8th for partial printing work.
“The office will send someone to Kuala Lumpur next week to pick up goods, and then return to Sabah to carry out the final stage of printing. It is estimated that it will take about two more working days (December 20th) to be delivered to the applicant.”
“We will notify applicants to go to each district branch to collect their admission tickets. ”
He added that Sabah has issued 2,4801 sets of birth certificates so far this year.

People's Daily Commentator: "The '14th Five-Year Plan' sets a good starting point - on studying and implementing the spirit of the Central Economic Work Conference" - Xinhua Net
According to the People's Daily, the article "The '14th Five-Year Plan' sets a good start - on the topic of studying and implementing the spirit of the Central Economic Work Conference" was published by Xinhua News Agency in Beijing on December 11.
"The '14th Five-Year Plan' has been successfully launched." The Central Economic Work Conference held from December 8th to 10th highly evaluated the economic and social development achievements of China in the past year.

He pointed out the direction forward and provided fundamental guidance.
We solemnly celebrate the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China and officially announce the completion of the construction of a moderately prosperous society, the realization of the first centenary goal, and the opening of a new journey towards the second centenary goal.
We are holding a meeting of the Party's 19th National Congress, summarizing the great achievements and historical experience of the Party's century-long struggle, and adopting the third historical resolution of the Party's hundred-year history, the "Resolution of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the Great Achievements and Historical Experience of the Party's Century-Long Struggle." This is the political declaration of new era Chinese Communist Party members in remembering their original mission, adhering to and developing socialism with Chinese characteristics, and it is an action guide for realizing the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.
Over the past year, there have been unprecedented global changes and the COVID-19 pandemic has spread worldwide, exacerbating the complex and severe external environment. The tasks of controlling the COVID-19 pandemic and promoting economic and social development in China are extremely heavy and daunting.
The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, with Comrade Xi Jinping as its core, adheres to the overall deployment of domestic and international affairs, adheres to the general principle of seeking progress while maintaining stability, and steadfastly responds to the great changes of the past century and the century-long epidemic. It integrates epidemic prevention and control and economic and social development, accelerates the construction of a new development pattern, strengthens macroeconomic policy cross-cycle adjustment, and strives to promote the continuous and healthy development of the economy. It strives to deepen reform, opening up, and innovation, and strives to complete the arduous task of reform, development, and great achievements of the Party and the country.
"14.5" realizes a good start, an important aspect lies in building a new development pattern, taking new steps towards high-quality development and achieving new results.
China's economic development and epidemic prevention and control maintain a global leading position, with the characteristics of strong resilience, large potential, and strong momentum. The country's strategic scientific and technological strength continues to accelerate, with major innovation results competing for emergence, technological innovation capabilities continue to improve, and key core technologies break through new breakthroughs.

The guarantee of people's livelihood is strong and effective, with the scale of employment continuously expanding, and residents' income growth basically synchronized with economic growth. China has maintained grain output of over 1.3 billion metric tons for seven consecutive years, winning the "18 Consecutive Harvests" award. Ecological civilization construction continues to advance,
These achievements are the result of the strong leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core, the result of the application of the new era Chinese-style socialism with Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics, and the result of the united efforts of the entire Party, the entire nation, and all ethnic groups.
Practice once again confirms that the Party has established Comrade Xi Jinping's central leadership in the Party Central Committee and has established Comrade Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era as the guiding ideology of the Party, which has a decisive significance for the development of the Party and the country in the new era and for the historical process of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.

On the 21st and 22nd of this month, the entrance examination for middle school special talents in Beijing City was unified organized by each district education committee.
This year, all districts in Beijing have reduced the proportion of special-needs students in the enrollment, and the competition among special-needs students has become more intense.

The admission ratio is also less than 10% of the total number of students enrolled in the school.
Students with sports, art, and technology talents who have registered online are all eligible to participate in the special talent recruitment examination.
To facilitate students' convenience in taking the exam, the East City District continues the exam arrangement method used last year, setting up 1-2 examination sites in each school, a total of 13 examination sites.
The examination points are divided into examination zones according to the examination zones, and the examination time is divided into time slots according to the examination time. On the day of the examination, students will enter the examination points at different examination zones and take the examination according to the time slots.
On May 23rd, the list of students who passed the district education enrollment examination was announced online. Students can check their exam results online.

The National Health Commission issued a document requiring the strengthening of epidemic prevention and control measures in border cities, with a 48-hour negative nucleic acid test result and the establishment of a "buffer zone" - Xinhua Net.
The State Council's Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism recently issued a notice on strengthening the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic at the land port cities, requiring people who need to leave the land port cities (excluding those with a land border with Hong Kong and Macao) within the next 48 hours to have a negative nucleic acid test result and to undergo at least one nucleic acid test upon arrival in the land port city.
According to the notice, the time range for the above requirements is from the date of determining the coastal city range in each province, autonomous region, and municipality directly under the Central Government and publishing it to March 15, 2022.
In addition, the notice also proposes that under certain conditions, cities along the border can set up epidemic prevention and control buffer zones within their administrative areas.
The National Health and Health Commission's Disease Prevention and Control Office has introduced that for some border cities, cross-border trade is the main economic pillar, and people from both sides travel back and forth frequently.
Implement differential control policies, from a single line of defense to two lines of defense, which can achieve the goal of pre-emptive control and reduce the risk of epidemic spread, with the aim of achieving the maximum epidemic prevention effect at the minimum social impact and lowest social cost.
In recent weeks, there have been many local outbreaks of the epidemic in our country, all of which are imported from abroad through border cities.
The above notice points out that some places have not timely issued epidemic monitoring and early warning, the closed-loop management of high-risk personnel has not been implemented in a timely manner, the regular nucleic acid testing has been formalistic, the disinfection of cold chain logistics has not been effective, the management of centralized isolation areas is not standardized, and the scientific and accurate handling of the epidemic has not been sufficient.
Notify the need to strengthen the prevention and control mechanism of the city's epidemic, improve the monitoring and warning system for epidemics, implement border control measures, and strengthen the weak links in the prevention and control of the city's epidemic. Do not relax, do scientific and accurate work, and tighten the defense line of epidemic prevention and control.
Notify that all coastal cities should synchronize the prevention and control of the epidemic with the guarantee of people's livelihood, and publish and widely disseminate the hotline for people's livelihood guarantee. Regularly investigate and resolve the hidden dangers in the supply and price of basic necessities, and actively respond to the prominent issues reflected by the masses.
According to the notice, the "border city" referred to includes the open land, water, and air ports of the specified counties (cities, districts, banners), as well as the counties (cities, regions, banners), and the cities (autonomous regions, municipalities) where they are located. The specific scope shall be determined by each province (autonomous region, municipality) based on the epidemic prevention and control needs and announced in a timely manner.

Oil pipeline video exposes US military's 20-year bloodthirsty killing spree - Xinhua Net
(Video source: oil pipe)
On December 11th, a micro-documentary named "Killer Machine" was posted on the oil pipeline platform, attracting widespread attention.
The film tells the story of how the United States, under the guise of fighting terrorism, launched a war in Afghanistan, and through the war, forced the export of American-style democracy. After 20 years of poverty, brutality, bloodlust, and murder of the innocent, the United States has committed countless crimes against humanity.
Use drones to bomb hospitals, schools, and other civilian facilities, twist human nature, and form a murderous group.
For the past 20 years, the US military has killed tens of thousands of innocent Afghans.
The US military has set up a "black jail" to subject "suspects" to various forms of torture and humiliation.
The increasing number of anti-human crimes in Afghanistan arouses more hatred among the Afghans.
As the video says, the "anti-terrorism" war in the United States is "getting worse and more terrifying."
War has not brought peace, democracy, prosperity, and hope to the Afghan people. It has only brought destruction and suffering.
Stab the video, let's expose the truth behind America's "anti-terrorism" bloodbath, and pierce through the hypocrisy of American democracy!
I accidentally saw the following article, from the perspective of business and storage period, why this customer wants to have a packaging company in the bonded area. Although packaging belongs to deep processing and does not belong to the scope of operation of the bonded logistics company, here is the text of the article that may explain why the customer wants to do this.
I have visited many dairy factories and seen many dairy production lines.
In fact, the ingredients of the baby formula in a pouch and a can are the same, there is no difference between them.
So everyone will definitely ask: Why is the warranty period for bags one year, while the warranty period for hearing aids is two years or even longer?
Or again, I ask: Why is the price difference between hearing aids and pouches so large?
Actually, many consumers believe that the quality is better because the raw materials are different.
In fact, the original materials are the same, it's just that everyone thinks that your's is better.
There are also consumers who, due to this mentality, eat it afterward and say that the taste or aroma is different!
Now I'll tell everyone the reason why we're so expensive, where is the luxury?
Why is the price difference so great when their raw materials are the same?
Because when the factory is pricing, most of them consider that if the packaging price is too high, consumers will find it difficult to accept, which means that the factory's profit is very low, or even no profit, then how does the factory survive?
Therefore, in terms of pricing, they have a very large upward price range to ensure their profit space.
Therefore, most factories recommend hearing protection, rather than earplugs.
There are many factories that you want to advertise every year, and the advertising fees are several hundred million or even several billion. Where is this money from?
Everyone can think and know.
So as society develops, the promotion costs for the market, such as the cost of promotional personnel in the shopping mall, the cost of display in the shopping mall, the cost of gifts for products, and advertising costs, are constantly increasing.
Therefore, each factory is constantly increasing the number of new products, and they are all custom-made. The prices of these new products are also constantly rising, in fact, this is due to the increase in market costs.
The main purpose is to obtain higher profits. In fact, the cost of their raw materials increased by a few cents at most.
There is another part of the brand that, in order to promote their products, will stop at nothing and hook up with doctors in hospitals, relying on them to help promote the products, from taking one pill to earning 30 yuan to 80 yuan or more in profit.
And in China, relevant laws and regulations absolutely prohibit such operation methods, in fact, this kind of behavior is harmful to consumers.
It is recommended to buy powdered milk in bags and store it in containers at home, which can save costs and improve the storage and sealing of the milk powder. It has no impact on children.
Don't think that the shelf life of packaged food is longer than that of unpackaged food just because it's packaged. If the shelf life of packaged food and unpackaged food is the same after opening, it's just that packaged food is more difficult to preserve after opening and is more prone to changes in quality due to moisture.
The food delivery is late, and the food is all cold. After it cools down, it becomes dry and hard, and there is no way to eat it.
And the soup spilled out of the bowl.

Don't push people onto the starting line - Xinhua Net
When browsing bookstores, you often feel the booming fire of success books.
Many successful self-help books today claim to be based on the "best principles" - that is, they first assume or imply that you can "do it" and then tell you what you need to do to achieve success.
Equivalent to saying that one has actually gone beyond the "how to do it" phase, which is actually the most important and fundamental part.
Therefore, these books all have a common characteristic - either they are done to perfection or they are completely worthless; either they are 100, or they are 0; either you climb to the top of the mountain, or you simply wait at the bottom.
This "best principle" makes everyone recognize its "correctness beyond measure", but 99% of people will be knocked down at the starting line.
Because this theory advocates a path of "you need to make a firm decision, undergo a 180-degree transformation, and start over," which is the fatal weakness of many people.
For those who are rigid in adhering to tradition, sticking to the old ways, and resisting change, you insist on shouting "you need to transform" in their ears, which is undoubtedly self-deception and ridiculing oneself.
Most people will be intimidated by the word "transformation" and will not dare to take the first step, or they will make a rash decision based on a temporary impulse and take the first step boldly, but it is difficult to maintain it for a long time.
The famous "From Tomorrow" song by Mr. Ma Sanli, which is widely regarded as a classic that vividly portrays the universal human nature.
The biggest problem with the "best practices" is that the threshold is too high, often exceeding the ability limit of ordinary people, making most people "look at the door in awe."
Perhaps, "the second-best principle" is a path that can lead more ordinary people to a relatively successful life.
The core of the "principle of the second-best" lies in "reducing thresholds" - it encourages a "small victory is better than none" theory, that is, if you can't do 100, doing 1 is okay: because 1 is always greater than 0; if you can't climb Mount Tai, just climb the small sand hill by your house, because that's still better than staying where you started.
In summary, just do something, and it will be better than not doing anything.
Because the threshold has been lowered significantly, it has increased the possibility for ordinary people to persevere, and as long as one perseveres, the success probability will also increase.
The success path that follows the "second-best principle" is slightly longer than that of simply adhering to it.
In summary, although "the best principle" may sound like a flag for everyone to succeed on the surface, it ultimately only motivates a small number of people. On the other hand, "the second-best principle" can effectively motivate more people, making it possible for more people to benefit as much as possible.

The resource reserves of Qinghai Lake have increased by 71,000 tons this year - Xinhua Net
According to a report from Xinhua News Agency in Yining on December 11, a journalist from the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs in Qinghai Province learned that the latest monitoring results show that the resource storage capacity of Qinghai Lake has increased by 0.71 million tons this year, reaching 10.85 million tons. Compared with the initial protection period in 2002, the cumulative increase is more than 40 times.
The Qinghai Lake carp, also known as the "Tibetan carp", is a rare and valuable fish species endemic to Qinghai Lake. It plays a crucial role in maintaining the safety and diversity of the "water-fish-bird" ecological chain in the Qinghai Lake watershed.
In the 20th century, the 60s and 70s, the large-scale killing and overbreeding of Qinghai Lake carp led to the deterioration of the aquatic environment, resulting in a sharp decline in the number of Qinghai Lake carp. In 2002, the resource storage capacity of Qinghai Lake carp was only 2592 tons.
In 2004, the Chinese Species Red List listed the Qinghai Lake bream as an endangered species.
Since 2003, Qinghai Province has implemented a ban on fishing in Qinghai Lake and its main tributaries, prohibiting any unit, collective, or individual from fishing for crucian carp in the lake and its tributaries, and prohibiting the sale of crucian carp and its products.
At the same time, through the artificial breeding and release of fish and the cleaning of the main inlet and outlet rivers of Qinghai Lake, as well as the design of scientific and reasonable "fish passages," measures have been continuously strengthened to protect the resources of Qinghai Lake carp, and the resource storage capacity of Qinghai Lake carp has increased year by year.
The vice director of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs of Qinghai Province, Yang Lin, introduced that as of now, nearly 1.8 billion fingerlings of Qinghai Lake carp have been artificially bred and released into the lake, which has contributed more than 23% to the restoration of Qinghai Lake carp resources.
The Qinghai-Tibet Plateau is an important ecological barrier and water source in China and even Asia, and Qinghai Lake is a natural barrier and ecological function area that controls the expansion of the western desert to the east.
To protect the ecological environment of the Three Rivers Region and the Qinghai Lake watershed, to protect the aquatic wildlife, and to maintain the biodiversity of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, since this year, Qinghai has successively issued notices on the prohibition of fishing in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, the Yellow River, and Qinghai Lake, and has established a comprehensive "one river, one lake, one river" fishing ban management system.

Restaurant only gave me a bag to put the food in, it's cold outside.
May I ask, is the takeout food packed in a bag?
We only see a bag.
"Would you like to know if it was an oversight or if someone took it?" Thanks.
It has been 1 hour already, and I still haven't sent it.
I just saw a long article on how to write a fake example.
Educate men who don't know about it.
Most girls experience their first menstruation between the ages of 13 and 15, and they will experience menopause around the age of 50.
On the premise of maintaining physical health, it will be relatively regular to come once a month.
But it's not a rule that can be precisely predicted. There is generally a week's deviation, and it needs to be prepared in advance. Sometimes the luck is bad and the car will be delayed (suddenly needing to prepare several days in advance).
The duration, blood volume, and severity of menstrual cramps vary from person to person. Some people experience them for three days, while others for a week; some people have little or no bleeding, while others have heavy bleeding; some people have no reaction, while others are in so much pain that they need to be taken to the hospital by ambulance. The severity of menstrual cramps can change over time, and it's not necessarily a sign that you'll never have them again if you don't experience them now.
Menstrual bleeding cannot be controlled, and it lasts for 24 hours a day from the beginning to the end of a few days. The only thing that can be done is to use a sanitary napkin or sanitary towel to absorb the blood and prevent it from soaking into clothing or furniture.
The main cause of menstrual cramps is the secretion of progesterone. During the early stages of menstruation, taking ibuprofen can effectively relieve menstrual pain. However, taking ibuprofen after menstrual cramps have started is not as effective.
Before menstruation, due to uterine bleeding and excessive release of progesterone, it is easy to feel bloated.
If you're around ovulation time, you might feel a strange sensation in your abdomen, and your period should come within two days.
It's best to change the sanitary napkin every 2-3 hours, otherwise it's easy to breed bacteria. If you subtract the time spent sleeping, the worst situation is to change it 6 times a day, which is 7 days a month, that's 42 pieces. If you add the extra ones prepared in advance, there may be 50 pieces. It's not that you use one piece every month.
(Here is a modification, sanitary towels do not need to be changed frequently, about five or six times a day is enough, the longest eight hours)
During menstruation, hormones can cause mood swings, and during ovulation, emotions can become unstable due to changes in hormone levels in the body, making you feel very unstable and causing your body to feel exhausted.
But official crime rate data can show that women have a high ability to control their emotions and will not use emotional issues as an excuse.
The flow is not only blood, but also includes the shedding of the uterine lining.
After menstruation, the endometrium inside the uterus is the thinnest, and it gradually thickens afterwards. It can be understood that the uterus is like a house, and every month, a new house (the endometrium thickens) is prepared to welcome guests. However, the guests do not come, so everything is demolished (menstruation occurs), and the process starts again the next month.
Menstruation is very inconvenient. For several decades, I have had continuous bleeding for 24 hours a day for several days every month, and I also have abdominal and back pain. Who would be willing to do this?
But people can be born because his mother passed the menstruation, menstruation is to prepare for the first time you come to this world for 10 months, everyone should thank their mother for regular menstruation.
Many things for women were suppressed in the past, and society used to brainwash women into thinking that they were dirty and shameful. Everyone thought that was the norm, but times have changed.
If someone thinks menstruation is disgusting and that the female body's preparation behavior for childbirth is disgusting, they should not say it out loud in public. Girls should stand up and not think about it anymore, as they have never experienced it and will never experience it, and they do not understand men either. They should not be so ungrateful and forgetful of their mothers' kindness. How can they face their mothers with such an attitude, and how can they want their own children?
Finally, sisters, try out the hygiene cotton pads, they are really useful.
Today is the Winter Solstice, and sending mistakes is quite disappointing.
Order an extra meal for the little friend to eat.
I hope the store can check the quality of the products in the busy season.
Is the electric leakage from the foot bath basin causing your hair to become discolored?
Choosing the appropriate foot bath can have a good therapeutic effect on foot health. Today, the country's small editor will answer this question and hope to be helpful to friends.
As people's awareness of health care improves, bathtubs are increasingly favored by consumers, and a large number of products with different specifications have emerged on the market, ranging from hundreds of yuan to thousands of yuan, providing consumers with a wide range of choices.
On the relevant data tables, compared with traditional home appliances, health-related home appliances such as bathtubs are selling like hotcakes, but there is no special industry standard for bathtubs, so there is a certain safety hazard.
“It’s too dangerous to soak your feet in electric water!”
Mr. Li told the reporter that he recently bought a foot bath for his father as a birthday gift, but when his father soaked his feet, he felt pain in his foot soles.
At first, Mr. Li thought it was the vibration function of the bathtub that caused it, but he didn't realize that even after turning off the vibration function, his father still felt a tingling sensation in his feet.
Mr. Li tried using an electric pen, and to his surprise, the pen lit up. Mr. Li discovered that the water in the bathtub was also electrified.
Later, he contacted the store, and the store's attitude was not bad, although they returned the bathtub, Mr. Li still felt unhappy.
Because he found that there is no clear and detailed industry regulation on the popular bathtub, such as how to set the highest temperature, which group of people it is suitable for, what materials are guaranteed to be safe, etc.
But in general, bathtubs do not have electrical problems, and it is also possible that some products were not strictly inspected during the manufacturing process.
Therefore, when buying, choose a shower pan with a partition.
Separation of water and electricity has no safety hazards.
You can take the pen test at the same time.

At the opening ceremony, the provincial leaders awarded the fourth batch of enterprises with the right to use the "Lake South Red Tea" trademark, and New Huanxiang held the "Lake Red Source".
In the New Hangzhou Tea Museum, Fujian tea merchants fell in love with a high-mountain tea named "Ice in the Spring" and immediately placed an order.
The secretary-general of the Provincial Tea Industry Association, Wang Jun, said that the epidemic and other factors have had a certain impact on the tea market, but from the tea show on the spot, the highlights are eye-catching.
Newly fermented red tea has a touch of red, injecting the cultural connotation of tea, popularity is booming, transactions are hot, and the Hubei tea industry warmly welcomes the arrival of the new spring.
If these foods are not hot, can they be canceled?
I don't want it anymore, because I can't stop here and he couldn't send it over.
Metaphysics is the study of problems that cannot be answered directly through perception, but require rational reasoning and logic.
Metaphysics is the fundamental principle of philosophy, aimed at explaining the essential properties of existence and the world.
The Chinese translation of "metaphysics" is taken from the "Yijing • Si Zhì Shàng Chū" section of the "Yijing" (Book of Changes), which says, "That which is above is called 'Dao,' that which is below is called 'Jì' (instrument)." This phrase was translated by the Japanese scholar Inoue Tetsujirō (during the Meiji period) from "metaphysics."
The branch of metaphysics includes ontology, natural theology, and related issues.
The theory of reference is "the study of which nouns represent real existing entities, and which nouns only represent a concept."
Metaphysics is naturalism, denying the existence of God.
Its theoretical basis believes that all phenomena can be explained by natural reasons, and it is proposed by philosophers who support scientific and evolutionary theories.
And the method of naturalism refers to the study method that does not acknowledge the existence of God.
Spiritual philosophy is the branch of philosophy that studies the essence of consciousness and its relationship with the body (especially the brain) in a fundamental way.
The two schools of thought, dualism and monism, are the two main schools of thought in discussing the relationship between the soul and the body.

It studies what style of moral behavior standards people should follow), applied ethics (applying ethical theories to real-life situations, including biomedical ethics, political ethics, etc.), and descriptive ethics (collecting information on how people live and summarizing from observed styles).
It is not a view of moral inspection based on anticipated theory, but an investigation of actual moral agents (moral subjects) who make choices and are observed to do so in reality, which promotes all moral factors leading to this choice, and it discusses the moral views held by social groups.
The history of ethics includes Greek and Roman ethics, medieval Christian ethics.
The first part: the ethical thought of humanism, represented by figures such as Voltaire and Montesquieu.
The second part: The ethical thought of the Reformation, represented by Calvin.
The third part is political ethics, represented by figures such as Machiavelli, modern ethics (17-18th century British empiricist ethics, represented by figures such as Hume, 17-18th century continental rationalist ethics, represented by figures such as Spinoza, 18th century French Enlightenment ethics, represented by figures such as Voltaire, 18th century German Enlightenment ethics, represented by figures such as Kant and Hegel, 18-19th century British utilitarian ethics, represented by figures such as Bentham and Mill, 19th century evolutionary ethics, represented by figures such as Spencer and Huxley, 19th century and later, German neo-Kantian ethics, represented by figures such as Laski, 19th century and later, neo-Hegelian ethics, represented by figures such as Green.

Ding Zilin: To my friend.
The writer sincerely thanks all friends who have given humanitarian aid to our family over the past 30-plus years since our parents passed away. In particular, I would like to thank those who have provided continuous aid since I made a personal appeal for help in 1994.
Most of the deceased's parents have already passed away, and their orphans have grown up and started their own families.
It is your generosity that has helped us, the underprivileged families, to overcome the most difficult moments in our lives.
The current COVID-19 pandemic is ravaging the world, and most of the donors are also approaching retirement age.
Therefore, I urgently request that you all stop giving us the hard-to-belong kindness - the donations of the Tiananmen Square mothers' group. This humanitarian aid activity should have ended long ago with a perfect sentence.
I will forever cherish your love and believe that your noble deeds will be remembered in history.
Due to various reasons, I can only express my intentions in this way, and I hope my friends will understand!
Please accept my sincere blessings.
Tao Yi suggests: Please allow me to take this opportunity to introduce the history of 32 years of humanitarian aid by the IFCSS and MCDF in the United States.
In the process of engaging in humanitarian aid, the American Association of Self-Reliance and the Minnesota China Democracy Foundation are parallel organizations, and the implementers of the project often have cross-over.

The relief funds are often unable to be delivered smoothly on June 4th, which is difficult to handle with one's own hands.
In 1994, under the suggestion of Master Ding, the "Tiananmen Mother" specially formed a team to coordinate and handle the collection and distribution of relief funds.
In 1998, MCDF established the "June 4th Orphans Education Fund", which was executed for 11 years. In 2009, after all the June 4th orphans graduated from university, MCDF established the "June 4th Impoverished Elderly Special Assistance Fund" and has been executing it continuously since then.
The funding for these projects mainly comes from donations made on June 4th of that year, as well as from donations from society and individuals. The projects also received support from the Democracy Foundation of Tsinghua University.
Since 2018, we have also received support from the Labor Union Research Fund.
Until last year, it had been 31 years since the June 4th Incident, and the victims' families finally received a portion of the donations collected in Hong Kong the previous year in the name of the June 4th Incident.
During this period, the "China Human Rights" also independently carried out their humanitarian aid projects.
We understand that Mr. Ding called for a halt to the donations for June 4th. This was for the consideration of the donors, and we certainly are all retired seniors with reduced incomes compared to before our retirement. Therefore, we would like to express our gratitude to Mr. Ding for his "thank you" letter to the donors.
We will respect the decision of the hard-to-get-along-with people and stop this project within two years. If necessary, we will immediately restore it.
For those who have persistently practiced benevolence and risked their own safety to deliver humanitarian aid to those in need, I would like to express my gratitude and respect.

Thank you for the review of the rabbit. I originally thought it was not suitable for the ancient style, but I didn't expect the final product to be so beautiful.
Thank you for your recognition, your satisfaction can make us full of energy to continue forward, we will continue to add oil!
This photography studio is really great! I strongly recommend all my little friends to come here!
No matter from reception, makeup, clothing, lighting, photography to post-production, there is no room for compromise.
The makeup artist is particularly delicate, and will match makeup products that are suitable for your style. The makeup products used are all from first-line brands.
Mr. Tian is no longer needed to speak, photography is a relatively professional field.
The whole workspace has an artistic atmosphere, and there are two cute little kittens playing around.
We are working in Beijing. The good movie theaters in Beijing all require advance booking of half a year, and some of my colleagues have been to Beijing and said that the movie they saw was just so-so.
I specially searched for this workspace, a place with a soul and attitude.
Our facial expression control is not very good, and we think this is also a common problem for most people. The photographer Xiaohao will take pictures and record the natural beauty of the moment.
Makeup artist, photographer, post-production design, a luxurious team.
Everyone around us, including ourselves, praises the film to the skies.
I have already recommended the film to my friends, and my friends who have seen the film are also full of praise.
I hope this kind of workspace won't be buried, and more people will discover TA, express their own style, rather than being uniform.
Thank you very much for the five-star review from Cai Ying and Xing Liang. Both of them are very creative and have great ideas. We are the creative workshop, and we will do our best to satisfy our customers. We are grateful for the opportunity to meet each other.
A sweet and caring assistant, as well as a lively and open-minded photographer teacher, every member of our team is super nice and beautiful. It was an amazing shooting experience that was hard to forget, and the results of the shooting were even better than I imagined. Thank you all for your hard work. 😘😘
Thank you for your review, Xiaoyu. Getting to know you is also a matter of fate. From Hohhot to Qinhuangdao, the trust you have placed in us is like a journey of several thousand kilometers. I am very happy to have met you and hope to have the opportunity to come back to Qinhuangdao and play again in the future.

If you plan to enter this industry, you can choose to go to a place for training. However, if you don't have this idea, it's better to self-study, because the cost of training is very high and you need to spend 6 months to learn.
But if you are planning to enter this industry, training is definitely a very good choice, especially for those who lack self-confidence and need to improve their skills.
If you have relatively strong self-discipline, you can choose to self-study, but it will be more tiring.
Of course, choosing a good training institution is a very important thing.
First, we need to look at the teaching staff of this institution. If the teaching staff is not strong enough, then this training institution has no meaning. Of course, some newly established training institutions have not yet built up their teaching staff.
Secondly, before choosing a training institution, it is best to investigate the institution itself and its students, because only the students of the institution know how good or bad the institution is and how good or bad the courses are taught.
Hello, to be honest, I don't know how to answer your question because I haven't made any introduction to your personal situation. And learning this thing has a very big relationship with one's personal situation.
For example, your profession, age, desired language, even the city where you want to study or work, all of these will be related to your field of study or desired industry.
If you are a student and have not yet graduated, or if you are a computer science graduate, then if you have enough time, I personally recommend self-study. This is the most efficient and cost-effective way. Nowadays, many offline and online training institutions are actually very good, but the cost of learning is high and the investment of time is relatively large, and you need to concentrate on training for 3-6 months.
But if it's the situation I said, self-study is very convenient. Now there are many free learning resources on the network, and there are also many training resources on Bilibili. If you don't know where to find them, you can contact me through the introduction and get free resources or detailed consulting.
In addition, there are some classic books that can be combined with videos for comprehensive learning.
If you are not a computer professional but can afford to pay a certain amount of learning cost and time cost, then I suggest you go to a training institution to learn. This way, you can learn without spending too much effort, and the teacher's explanation is also very detailed. If you have any questions, there are people specially assigned to answer them. In addition, there is also help with learning planning or supervision.
Moreover, many training institutions nowadays will sign employment agreements with students, with guaranteed internship positions, and recommend them to companies after they finish their studies. This can save a lot of trouble when it comes to job interviews in the future.
These are some of my thoughts. I didn't understand your situation, so I only roughly introduced it and didn't go into detail. If you have any other questions or want to consult with me, you can contact me at any time for communication and exchange.
I said I arrived 1 point earlier, and I saw it on the App.
What is it called?
What are you doing?
This person accepts various tasks such as installation, cleaning, and maintenance of boilers, washing machines, water heaters, vacuum cleaners, air conditioners, toilets, stoves, oil burners, lighting fixtures, professional sewing, and home cleaning services.
Thank you to those who silently gave me a thumbs up. Life is tough, but we have to keep going.
Life will not be burdensome for those who toil diligently, so please pay attention to me. Thank you to those who silently give me a thumbs up.
Life is like this, others only see the result, I alone support the process, face life, we are not only strong, but also continue, with no other choice, the road can be turned back to see but not to return.
Cleaning is a job, a responsibility, life is beautiful because of service, service is delightful because of dedication.
Although cleaning is the dirtiest job, we will use the most serious attitude to clean every corner of the customer's house. We want to see the satisfied smile on the customer's face and the raised thumb, knowing that all the hard work is worth it and there is a reward for our efforts.
My work is very interesting.
——Your requirements, my services.
Use your heart to serve, use your heart to clean, and leave behind a beautiful memory.
Your concerns are of utmost importance to us, and we strive to provide you with the best service possible. Our goal is to make your life as comfortable and stress-free as possible, so that you can focus on the things that matter most to you and your family.
Keep the houses clean and tidy, carve the family governance tablet, serve until it is in place, and keep it clean until it reaches the house.
Indoor and outdoor cleaning, my daily work.
Although crystal lamps are beautiful, they will become dull and lose their luster if they are not cleaned for a long time. Only after cleaning can they shine brightly, just like life.
Success comes from using one's mind and diligence, and refining one's skills with meticulous attention to detail.
Give me a chance, I will definitely make you satisfied, quality speaks for itself, because professionalism is worth trusting, your recognition is my greatest encouragement!
It seems like everything in every industry is going downhill right now!
"But I always believe that as long as we have a serious attitude, perseverance, and hard work, we will be better than others, at least we won't be sitting around complaining all the time."
The plan for the day begins at dawn, all the beauty starts from the early morning. I hope you bring happiness, luck, health, and success with you, and start a new day with a good mood, maintaining a whole day of good luck. Good morning!
When we were young, happiness was a thing we possessed, and having it made us happy; as we grew older, happiness became a goal we sought, and achieving it made us happy; but as we matured, we discovered that happiness was a state of mind, and understanding it made us truly happy.
Be the best version of yourself, follow your heart, and live without regrets; there is only one path in life, walk your own path; the two greatest treasures in life are a healthy body and a happy heart, live a beautiful life until old age!
Every stage of life will encounter different challenges.
Often, the things that limit you are not your abilities, but your own fears and doubts.
Since we can't avoid it, let's face it head-on.
The more you are afraid, the more you will fall into difficulties; if you face the challenges head-on, the problems will eventually be resolved.
A Chinese curator is collaborating with Saudi Arabia to hold the first contemporary art biennial exhibition in Riyadh - Xinhua Net
Xinhua, Riyadh, December 12 (Reporter Wang Haiqing, Huang Can) The first contemporary art biennial in Saudi Arabia, the Diriyah Biennial of Contemporary Art, officially opened to the public on December 11 in the Diriyah JAX Art Zone in the northwest of the Saudi capital Riyadh. A total of 64 artists from Saudi Arabia, China, and other regions participated in the exhibition.
This year's dual-year exhibition is jointly planned by the Saudi Diryah Dual-Year Exhibition Fund and the UCCA DURIEUX Contemporary Art Center in China. The director of the UCCA DURIEUX Contemporary Art Center, Tian Weiping, serves as the art director.
According to the curatorial team's introduction, the theme of this year's exhibition is "Touching the Stones to Cross the River," which represents the reform strategies adopted during the period of social and economic transformation in Saudi Arabia and reflects the current situation of Saudi cultural development.
This year's dual-year exhibition covers an area of nearly 12,000 square meters. The exhibition hall is composed of six interconnected buildings, presented in six units: "Touching the Stones across the River," "Tradition as Experiment," "Edge Thinking," "Walking towards the Public," "Beautiful New World," and "On the Spirit of Art."
Among the 27 Saudi Arabian artists' works, which account for more than four-fifths of the total number of exhibits, include painting, installation art, and performance art in various forms; 12 Chinese artists' works are also highly regarded, some of whom use innovative ways to recycle materials in their creations, such as Xu Bing, who reconstructed a classic landscape painting using discarded objects in his "Story Behind the Waterfall" series (2014).
According to the CEO of the Diriyah Biennial Foundation, Bakkili, he hopes that this biennial exhibition will establish an international dialogue, allowing audiences around the world to understand the cultural industry and creative community in Saudi Arabia, and strengthen exchanges and interactions.
Tian Wei Yu said: "The goal of the two-year exhibition is double, it can allow Saudi contemporary art to participate in the global conversation and also allow Saudi audiences to immerse themselves in the world of contemporary art."
According to understanding, during the two-year exhibition cycle, a series of lectures will be held, and artists, curators, and leaders in the creative industry will discuss topics such as cross-cultural communication and contemporary art development.

Yunnan: Coordinating and standardizing the management of public welfare positions in rural areas - Xinhua Net
Yunnan Province in China's Yunnan Province has recently taken measures to continuously improve the employment of impoverished populations and consolidate the achievements of poverty alleviation. The local government has implemented policies to promote the development of rural areas and improve the management of public positions in rural areas, in order to assist in the comprehensive promotion of rural revitalization.
The Yunnan Provincial Department of Civil Affairs has introduced that at present, Yunnan has opened up 44.83 million rural public service positions, which are used to employ rural disadvantaged groups such as poverty-stricken laborers, and have played an important role in helping these groups achieve employment growth, consolidate the results of poverty alleviation, and effectively improve the public service capabilities of rural areas.
This new regulation was jointly issued by seven departments including Yunnan Provincial Department of Human Resources and Social Security, Rural Revitalization Office, Ministry of Finance, etc. It mainly regulates the scope of recruitment for rural public welfare positions, the management of funds, the development of positions, and the management of positions at the grassroots level.
In terms of job development, the new regulations are clear, and they are based on the principles of "job-based development, dynamic management, quantity control," "who develops, who uses, who is responsible," and "one person, one job, voluntary disclosure, unified management."
Recruitment programs must follow the steps of advertisement, application, review, announcement, hiring, pre-employment training, and job assignment.
In addition, the new regulations also clearly specify the specific responsibilities of the main departments for developing rural public welfare positions, the standards and methods for subsidizing rural public welfare positions, and require each department responsible for developing rural public welfare positions to purchase commercial insurance for the rural public welfare position holders. It also requires relevant departments to regularly monitor the subsidy disbursement situation of rural public welfare positions.

Hello
Can you cancel the order?
I re-ordered.
Have you canceled it?
Although the rightists have had some shining moments in history, they have not lasted long, so they are short-lived. This is because they are like a spark that glows brightly when it is struck by a little bit of sunlight, but quickly fades away when the sunlight is gone. Similarly, they are like a person who sweats profusely when they drink a little bit of cold water, but quickly cools down when the water is gone. Furthermore, they are like a person who becomes arrogant and boastful when they achieve a little bit of success, but quickly loses their confidence when they are faced with setbacks.
But in reality, the rightists have played an active role in promoting social progress.
From defining the standard of truth at the end of the Cultural Revolution to developing the economy, promoting technological advancement, and advancing political institutionalization and human rights protection, the positive significance of the right-wing cannot be denied.
Three, in my opinion, although I do not fully agree with some of Li Weidong's statements, I am very concerned about his statements and highly respect Li Weidong as a person; because he is sincere, he is sincere about China, and he is sincere in his view of China's social problems.
But I am opposed to his anti-communist theory. I believe that revolution is not necessary, and that it will inevitably lead to social unrest, damage to the people's livelihoods, and the chaos of political parties. It will also provide an opportunity for foreign powers to intervene.
Fourth, to change or improve China, one must have patience and a responsible attitude towards the country and the people. Political opportunities seekers who try to take advantage of the situation, those are not rightists, they are troublemakers.
Let's talk more.
In fact, the Left is a group of abandoned children of history and politics.
If the right has positive significance for society, the Communist Party will listen to some right-wing opinions and analyze their thoughts when needed. However, the left has no need for this, because the left's goal is to get rid of the negative aspects that the Communist Party has thrown away!
5、 Recently, I saw some friends on the left side of the road when they saw a thief on the right side of the road, they all shouted and chased after him. I think it's not necessary to do so.
Don't try to reason with the Han collaborators and the leftists, they are all a bunch of nonsense, with no logic to speak of.
Don't try to prove that we are right, and don't think about making traitors and leftists admit it. Why bother?
I tell my friends: When the villains insult you for five cents, and when the left-handed person insults you for your right dog, it just proves that our middle road is correct!
Many people have ideals when they are young, but as they get older, they forget their ideals or become obsessed with them and end up as fanatics.
Gradually approaching the ideal, even the slaughter of the dragon youth may eventually become a wise dragon.
I think that "left" and "right" generally refer to constraints and freedom, and China's overall tendency should be biased towards the left due to its historical and cultural genetic inheritance.
The right-wing libertarians in China prioritize efficiency and development, while the left-wingers strengthen regulation and prioritize fairness and safety.
In today's society, there is a general desire for greater fairness, while China and the United States are in competition, and it is generally believed that the left is winning, and it is estimated that this will continue for many years to come.
Although I don't understand, just click the like button and it's done.
What's the use of talking about it? Flowers bloom on their own, and that's that.
In the past two years, the US has imposed sanctions and restrictions on Huawei's chips, not only leaving Huawei in an unprecedented predicament, but also causing "American" companies to suffer huge losses.
The US is suppressing China's semiconductor industry, and is demanding that its own companies and allied foreign companies simultaneously impose a blockade on China's semiconductor industry. This directly leads to the impact on the orders and profits of global semiconductor suppliers, resulting in a reduction in research and development investment and a decrease in production capacity of semiconductor manufacturers, causing disorder in the global semiconductor supply chain.
Nowadays, the shortage of chips has affected industries all over the world, such as car manufacturers stopping production and mobile phone price increases. Almost all industries that use chips have been affected.
In order to grasp the "chip" self-sufficiency, more and more countries' technology giants are starting to take the road of "de-Americanization".
To firmly control the global semiconductor industry and suppress the development of China's semiconductor industry, the United States has been taking frequent actions recently. It has even hosted the "Chip Summit" and invited 64 major companies from around the world to form a semiconductor alliance. It has also provided financial support to American domestic technology giants, such as Intel, which is trying to regain its leading position in the semiconductor industry by investing $200 billion in building two wafer fabrication plants in Arizona and opening up semiconductor manufacturing services to overseas customers.
Most people believe that Intel's move will have a certain impact on TSMC and may even steal TSMC's "bowl of rice."
The reason why it is so certain is that Intel, as the flagship technology giant of the United States, has been deeply cultivating in the semiconductor field for several decades, with a large team of talents and abundant technical reserves. It must be able to quickly rise and defeat TSMC in the short term.
However, for Intel's decision, TSMC's founder Chang Zheng-Ming was not impressed.
At the "2021 Master's Think Tank Forum" held in April this year, Zhang Zhongmou made a shocking statement, openly criticizing Intel's decision to invest in building a semiconductor factory. Zhang Zhongmou said without hesitation: Building a semiconductor factory by Intel is a parody.
Zhang Zhongmou was not very enthusiastic about Intel's entry into the memory field because he still harbored resentment towards Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) and Intel from over 30 years ago.
In the 1960s and 1970s, Intel was the shining star in the American manufacturing industry, occupying the pinnacle of the global market, and was the dominant player in the semiconductor field.
In the 1980s, the high-end semiconductor chips were monopolized by a few dominant players in the world.
At that time, the semiconductor industry was characterized by the IDM model, where chips were designed, manufactured, and packaged by a single factory. Intel was the representative of that era.
However, such a pattern makes it difficult for some small enterprises to bear the burden, and many semiconductor entrepreneurs face huge costs for building production lines and can only hesitate.
In response to market demand, after entering the 1980s, the semiconductor industry began to show the phenomenon of division of labor and cooperation, and in 1984, Zhang Zhongming heard that there was a company specializing in chip design, so he thought that since there was a company specializing in design, then he could establish a factory specializing in wafer manufacturing.
Not long after, Zhang Zhongmou's plan became a reality, and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) was born.
TSMC has aimed its main business at "crystal cutting" (晶圆加工), a single link in the semiconductor manufacturing process, without engaging in design and only providing contract manufacturing services for crystal cutting.
At that time, the newly established Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) was just a small player in front of Intel, the giant.
To obtain capital support, Zhang Zhongmou once approached Intel for investment, but when Intel heard that TSMC only does the manufacturing process of semiconductor chips, it was obviously a bit arrogant and looked down on TSMC, and decisively rejected the idea of investing in TSMC.
Zhang Zhuguo also acknowledged that Intel at the time did not take Jingyuan's service seriously.
I didn't expect the company that made jewelry last year to be so big, and now they have to start doing jewelry OEM.
So, Zhang Zhongming thought it was ironic for Intel to enter the wafer fabrication business.
Today, the market value of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) has surpassed that of Intel.
In the face of TSMC's strong offensive, Intel is also unwilling to stand still.
Today, TSMC has been pushing towards 3nm chips, while Intel is still stuck at 14nm from 7 years ago.
"Wanting to surpass others in reality is not an easy task."
Can't wait any longer.
I placed an order at 19:06 and it's been 2 hours already 😅
Today, I'll take a look at some [weird search trends].
What is a normal public opinion?
Randomly select three hot searches: February 2nd Long Live the Dragon, Hua Li You's price increase, and the PLRLA incident. The buzz spreads and forms a peak, then the index drops (smooth curve), and if a secondary buzz occurs, there will be a small peak again.
They look exactly the same as the network sentiment evolution model displayed on the official website of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology.
What is an abnormal public opinion?
Randomly select six keywords from the same event and present them in the form of a peak, a sawtooth, and a cliff.
【Isolated Peak】This refers to the act of heating up by oneself, resulting in rapid climbing of the hot search rankings and attracting public attention; 【Sawtooth】This refers to periodic heating, ensuring that the topic stays on the hot search rankings; 【Cliff】This refers to the collective withdrawal, where the hot search has fulfilled its "function", and it is ready to receive a new task or move on to a new battlefield.
In Figure 9, the heat wave peak of one event coincides with the trough of another event, with time differences of only a few seconds, which must be the moment when the unified water army received the task and launched a new round of attacks.
The professionalization of public relations can be seen in a few spots: several hot searches at the same time, which ones attract attention, which ones are responsible for publicity, which ones provoke war, which ones shift the focus, which ones influence cognition, which ones lead to wrong judgments, which ones incite emotions, which ones wrap up decisions, black PR accounts are divided into batches and fine-tuned at different nodes, almost considering all elements of the spread of public opinion.
Propaganda is a science, discarding all subjective factors such as standpoints and emotions, and only relying on objective data. Even black public relations will have nowhere to hide.
Everyone who passes by must leave a trace, and these traces, we will dig them out together.

Mauritius and other countries have reported the first cases of Omicron variant infection - Xinhua Net
According to a comprehensive report by the Xinhua News Agency, Mauritius, Cyprus, and Malawi have recently reported the first cases of the new coronavirus variant Omicron.
Mauritius reported its first two cases of the Omicron variant of COVID-19 on December 10th.
According to the introduction by Mao Zedong, a visitor from South Africa who arrived in Mauritius on November 27, and another local resident who had contact with a person who recently returned from South Africa, both tested positive for COVID-19 on November 30.
After being isolated and treated at the hospital, the two infected individuals had their nucleic acid test results turn to negative, and they have now returned to their respective places of residence.
The health department of Cyprus announced the first three cases of monkeypox infection in the country.
These 3 people are all students. They have just returned from abroad and have not been hospitalized for treatment due to their mild illnesses.
To prevent the spread of the Omicron variant, the government has been strengthening its epidemic prevention and control measures.
From December 6th to January 10th of next year, all 12-year-old and above travelers who arrive by plane in China will need to pay for a nucleic acid test at the airport upon arrival.
The State Council's Health and Family Planning Commission announced on the 10th that it will start vaccinating children aged 5 to 11 in China against COVID-19.
The Minister of Health and Wellness, Kwame Akufo-Addo, said on Wednesday that Ghana has discovered its first three cases of the Omicron variant of COVID-19.
The health department of this country conducted gene sequencing on 12 samples collected from November 9th to December 2nd, and found these 3 cases of infection.

Received is a belly full of money.
Order is a talon of a bird.
"Good, the phone number is #PHONENUMBER#."
Do I need to stay in the conversation?
I called your staff and explained everything to them.
Your driver told me the address is too far.

Address: South Road of the Ring, No. 156, Happy Family Garden, 12th Floor.
At the beginning, it was introduced by a friend because of trust, so I chose to come and take a look at the initial budget of 70,000 yuan for basic renovation.
As soon as you enter the store, a series of tricks begin.
I went to the store for the first time just to show them my model drawing. They didn't measure the actual house, but they were able to give me a quote saying that my 135 square meter house could be done for 7 million. They basically showed me their materials, but I didn't know what brand of materials they were.
Their second trick is that you'll be dragged to the store and forced to pay the deposit (once you've paid the deposit, you'll never be able to get it back, unless you have enough experience and can handle the theory war with them).
When I was hesitating whether to pay the deposit or not, they would invite their so-called manager to tell you that if you pay the deposit today, we can give you a certain amount of discount.
This is a big pitfall, and I am an example of being cheated alive. When my brain was in a rush, I paid a deposit of over 10,000 yuan.
He gave me a quote with many questions. The price is 7 million without including water and electricity renovation, and it doesn't include any doors or cabinets. The bathroom is also not included in the basic costs.
They charge more for their service points than other companies do.
I lost trust in this company. At the beginning, nothing was clear and they made me sign a contract.
When I went to get my money back from them, they acted like they had a lot of experience and had a special team to deal with me.
No matter what, it will be the customer's problem, and they are completely innocent.
There are various responsibilities, and there are many details. I don't want to say them all, but basically, don't choose them. My friend found their services for renovating a house, and the quality was not good. They will charge you various fees in the later stage.
The scam artist, they were originally the decoration of the scam, now they have become big and beautiful, as if they have collapsed and changed into something else.
So everyone should avoid choosing such a shitty interior design company.
In the future, everyone should pay more attention to these consultations and inquiries when choosing, because renovation is not a small matter.

This is so scary, if it doesn't arrive within 30 minutes, please cancel the order!
Is there no other way? For example, changing the address?
Alright, so you won't cancel this conversation. If I don't get my refund within 5 to 10 days, I'll definitely pursue it.
Can you cancel if it takes less than 15 minutes?
The chicken should be cooked, but the one I received is raw, and I can't eat it.
A great meteor shower of the Draco constellation will fall on the 14th day of the lunar calendar, according to the Chinese lunar calendar. - Xinhua Net
According to the Xinhua News Agency in Tianjin, December 12th, a science popularization expert introduced that as the last large-scale meteor shower of this year, the Geminid meteor shower, one of the three major meteor showers in the northern hemisphere, will reach its peak on December 14th. Fans of meteor showers can observe it after midnight on that day.
The Beijing Astronomical Enthusiasts Association captured the Geminid meteor shower on December 13, 2018, in Qinghai, China.
Most meteor showers come from periodic comets, but the parent body of the Taurid meteor shower is 3200 Phaethon, an Apollo-type asteroid.
The twin star meteor shower is currently the second known meteor shower that is not produced by a comet.
Zhang Xin, a council member of the Astronomical Society of Tianjin and an expert in popularizing astronomy, introduced that just like the festive films at the end of the year, the shower of stars in the constellation of Gemini will also appear around the end of the year, and the "screening period" can last from December 4th to December 17th.
This meteor shower is known for its large and stable flow, and is together with the Orionid meteor shower and the Geminid meteor shower, known as the three major meteor showers in the northern hemisphere.
One of the prominent features of the meteor shower of the Gemini constellation is that the meteoroids have a slower speed, a rich color, and a relatively large number of fireballs, which is suitable for both observation and photography for beginners in astronomy.
Yang Jing, a astronomer from Tianjin, captured the meteor shower of the Geminids on December 13, 2020 in Tianjin, China.
The astronomical forecast shows that this year's Geminid meteor shower will arrive at its peak around December 14th at around 3:00 PM. At its peak, the ZHR (the number of meteors visible per hour under ideal viewing conditions, with the radiant point directly above the observer's head) will be 150.
A recommendation chart for the meteor shower in the constellation of Gemini.
“Last year, the ‘falling stars’ of the twin star meteor shower left a deep impression on people, but this year’s twin star meteor shower will be affected by the moonlight, and the level of excitement will be slightly discounted.”
On the 14th day of the lunar calendar, it is the 11th day of the 11th lunar month, with the moon in the waxing phase. The bright moonlight will interfere with observation, but fortunately, the moon will set in the latter half of the night. At this time, the radiant point of the Draco meteor shower will also rise relatively high.
Friends who like to watch meteor showers can observe them in the latter half of the night after the moon has set. However, they should pay attention to protecting themselves from the cold.
How can I observe as many shooting stars as possible?
“It is not recommended to conduct observations in the city. You can choose a location in the suburbs or countryside with a high altitude, low light pollution, and a view towards the northeast. Then, wait patiently until after the moon has set, and observe with the naked eye.
It is important to note that the flow of stars in the constellation of Gemini is in all directions, so when observing, you do not need to constantly stare at the radiant point of the constellation of Gemini.
Friends who like photography want to take pictures of the beautiful "flower rain" scene, it is best to choose a wide-angle, large aperture lens for shooting, and use high ISO and the maximum aperture when shooting.
Based on stability and continuity considerations, a tripod, spare battery, and shutter cable are also indispensable.

What is the difference in market positioning between laser TV and traditional TV?
In my understanding, the "traditional TV" referred to by the questioner should be understood as LCD TVs. The main differences in market positioning between LCD TVs and laser TVs are as follows:
First, laser TV is more focused on the large screen market.
Compared to the market positioning of liquid crystal televisions, laser televisions are obviously more focused on the market for large screens, or you could say that laser televisions themselves are products specifically designed for large screens.
Currently, the mainstream sizes of liquid crystal televisions are between 55 and 65 inches, while the sizes of laser televisions are generally above 75 inches, with the largest exceeding 100 inches, fully meeting the user's demand for a large screen color TV.
In recent years, the export volume and sales ratio of laser TVs have been increasing globally, accounting for more than 60% of the total TV sales volume of 80 inches and above.
According to the prediction of Jingkang, in 2020, the market sales of laser TVs will increase by more than 140%, continuing to maintain high-speed growth.
The reason why there is such good performance in the market is mainly due to the excellent performance of laser TV in protecting eyes.
The imaging principle of laser TV is based on the reflection of laser light, and the laser source does not directly irradiate the eyeball. Compared with the backlight source of LCD TV, the imaging process is closer to the imaging process of objects under natural conditions, and the stimulation to the eyes is also smaller.
The Chinese Electronic Technology Standardization Research Institute, Xi'an Experimental Station, and the First Hospital of Peking University Ophthalmology Department conducted a strict comparison test under the same conditions for 144 groups of people to watch laser TV and LCD TV, and obtained 144 sets of test data.
Data confirms: Laser TV does indeed have a very strong protective effect on the eyes, and in some respects, it even has a certain improvement effect.
With the increasing attention to visual health in recent times, laser TVs not only attract more and more users with their protective eye advantages, but also open up a new breakthrough in the market for color TVs.
Secondly, laser TV is more focused on the high-end market.
While the price of LCD TVs continues to fall, the current market price of laser TVs is mostly above 10,000 yuan, and with the upgrade of size and light source, the price gradually rises.
What's the reason for the high price of laser TV?
Certainly, there is a reason for it.
With the continuous development of light sources and technology, laser TV has many advantages that cannot be achieved by traditional LCD and projection TVs.
By leveraging super-short focal length projection technology, laser TVs can achieve a shorter projection distance compared to traditional projection devices, allowing for a 100-inch screen experience at a short distance. The required space is relatively small, and the main unit is compact and takes up little space.
In terms of brightness, high-end laser TVs can achieve over 2000 nits.
Moreover, the heat dissipation is lower, which reduces equipment wear and teats, and the service life of the television is also longer.
Apart from that, many high-end laser TV models also come with true 4K ultra-high-definition picture quality, artificial intelligence systems, and biomimetic screens, among other cutting-edge technologies, which can provide users with a more stunning visual and auditory experience.
Instead of discussing false needs, we should focus on the products of fine-grained demand, and analyze the relationship between the quality of the painting and the investment-output ratio. Laser TV is not the dish of choice for audiovisual players who want to enjoy a big screen and a poor viewing environment. If you want to have both, you can try it out. Everything has its advantages and disadvantages, and it is up to you to weigh the pros and cons and make your own judgment. Don't be swayed by one-sided words.
To put it simply, super-wide-angle close-focus projector -- laser TV -- in order to get close to the screen, it must use expensive super-wide-angle lenses and mirrors, which does not conform to the best optical design.
To block some environmental light, use a microstructure Phineas screen, with a high cost, an 80-inch price can basically replace a 65-inch liquid crystal.
There's one more thing I particularly dislike. Some projection factory owners use the fact that the projector's light shines directly on the screen as a selling point, claiming that it's good for the eyes. But in reality, the light shines directly on the screen, and if it's reflected back to the ceiling, the eyes can't see it. If it's a true liquid crystal TV, it also shines directly, and if you open the TV, the ceiling won't be lit up either.
And if the projection screen is not a mirror, it will not be an image at all.
The author seems to have overlooked the hot spot effect of the high-gain barnacle, which is the reflection of light at a certain angle, resulting in a large amount of light being reflected into the eyes, making it difficult to bear.
The Wenxi Visual Arts Photography Studio is a high-quality store that selects excellent works. At present, there are no branches.
After adding the WeChat appointment date, the sister-in-law will arrange the available time for me and reply to my message in a timely manner.
I went to the store before and saw the shooting works, more of them were outdoor wedding photos, which were shot very beautifully and involved many shooting styles.
After that day, I had a simple conversation with Miss Zhang about my thoughts. She was very patient and helped me try on two sets of clothes that I was unsure about. Finally, we decided to start with makeup and hairstyling. Before the photographer takes pictures, he will arrange some props and guide the actions. He pays attention to every detail and is very meticulous.
But it's possible that because we didn't communicate specific shooting ideas, the style of the photos I took may not be what I wanted, but they should be good-looking 🙊🙊
After taking a photo, the photographer will help me choose the photo, communicate about the post-processing style, and I feel like he is very meticulous.
Improving a video takes about half a month, waiting for the effect~
The second time I participated in the banquet of the emperor, which was a shooting type. Almost all the clothes on the scene can be selected for one piece of shooting.
I finally chose a black dress and tried different styles.
The whole shooting process takes about 2 hours, including makeup and shooting. The photographer in charge of shooting is a 95-year-old brother, who feels a bit green and hopes to give more suggestions in the future on how to guide customers during shooting. The shooting process was quite pleasant.
Wenxiang Visual Arts Photography Studio Selected High-Quality Products
The homepage is up, come and take a look at Queenie~
First, fill in your name and phone number when you arrive at the store. Then, you can choose your clothes and wedding dress. I tried on three or four outfits and it was quite tiring, but the service attitude was good. Afterwards, I had my makeup done for a long time, and they taught me how to pose for the photoshoot. I felt like my face was too big in the photos, and the store said it would take about half a month to get the final product. However, I received it in just three or four days, and it felt like there was no difference between it and the original film.
【Environment】Overall good.
There are many optional clothing items.
There are three makeup positions, and there is a photography studio inside.
【Service】I am very enthusiastic and meticulous.
Sculptors have patience.
The photographer will also be very serious about teaching you how to pose.
Disappointed, even photographers will proactively propose re-shooting.
"【Experience】The model may be a bit too large, with the original double eyelid being pasted out with three eyelids."
The eyebrows are also shaved, which is a bit awkward for those who don't draw their eyebrows every day.
I took the photo for more than 10 days, but the P effect is not very satisfactory, and I feel that the double eyelid glue is still very obvious.
Because I'm not quite sure what style I want, I tried two sets and ended up going back and forth between them. In the end, I chose a black formal dress. The salesgirl said that this set was quite old-fashioned and traditional.
After choosing the clothes, it's time to start doing makeup. The hairstylist and makeup artist are very patient in helping me, and the final effect is very satisfying.
After doing my makeup and hairstyle, I started taking pictures. The photographer gave me instructions throughout the process to pose and strike a pose. The whole process was very relaxed and harmonious.
After finishing the photos, I carefully selected four of my favorite ones. The little brother said that the 15-minute film was completed, and the ending was very satisfying.
I haven't received a reply in 3 days... Because your system cannot recognize my credit card, I cannot join the #PRS\_ORG# plus monthly plan!
The most strange thing is that I always use the same credit card when I pay.

Can you exempt me from paying the monthly fee until you finish your investigation? This way, please?
Should I buy an umbrella insurance policy? Is it reliable?
Xiao Yǔ Shà is an internet insurance broker platform.
According to the regulations of "Insurance Agency Institution Supervision Regulations (2015 Revision)", to become an insurance agency company, it must meet three key words: the shareholders, the founders have no major illegal records in the past 3 years, and the minimum capital is 500 million yuan. It must also be approved by the China Insurance Regulatory Commission.
These three actually require quite a bit of strength. In summary, it is necessary to have the power of the national authority, to be approved by the China Insurance Regulatory Commission (which regulates all insurance companies and banks in the country), and the shareholders must have a good reputation. As a small umbrella insurance company, the policyholders do not need to question whether the small umbrella insurance is legitimate or not. After all, there are these three thresholds, and not all insurance companies can meet them.
On this point, it is not bad, it is worth trusting.
From the perspective of insurance products: Small umbrella insurance is like a supermarket of insurance products, with many companies' star illness insurance policies available on this platform. For example, the newly launched HTH Super Masterpiece 5, which is a star illness insurance policy, has both the underwriter and the reinsurer as HTH people, and Small Umbrella Insurance is just a third-party intermediary. There is no need to question its reliability.
From the perspective of payment mode: The products of internet platforms are generally more affordable than those of offline channels because they save on the cost of operating physical stores and the salaries of sales staff. In addition, the payment mode is flexible and supports monthly payments, which reduces the pressure on policyholders to pay premiums, and at the same time maximizes the leveraging effect of insurance.
This is still very good.
Can be considered.
From the perspective of business professionals: This is particularly important because insurance is an industry that requires a very high level of professionalism, and many internet product customers can purchase insurance themselves. This can lead to many misunderstandings, especially in the areas of health and career, where non-insurance professionals often add their subjective opinions when applying for insurance, thinking that they are healthy or meet the requirements. This can result in many hidden risks of claim denial, and there is a risk of being denied coverage.
I myself have worked on the "Tencent Wealth" platform (similar to JD.com, it is an internet insurance brokerage platform) as an insurance salesperson, and I am very responsible in telling everyone.
The insurance of the internet is true and reliable, and unreliable is the person. The internet insurance channel does not have professional service personnel, and there are also many sales misleading.
For example: 1 yuan insurance covers 600,000 yuan, buy insurance and get a mobile phone for free, and receive a cash payout of 600,000 yuan for serious illnesses. These marketing strategies are not wrong, but they are evasive and don't tell the policyholders that the first month is 1 yuan and the second month requires normal payment, which can be several tens to 200 yuan or more. Many customers are unclear about what they have purchased after deducting the premium for a few years.
Assume that you can spend 1 yuan, and the insurance company compensates 600,000 yuan (the whole cake falls).
Free mobile phones are given out as part of special insurance policies, such as those ending in numbers like 6666 or 8888. If you win a short message is sent, but if you don't exchange it, no one will remind you.
For those who buy insurance, it's just another trap. Free coverage of 600,000 yuan for serious illnesses is short-term. If you rely solely on this, without any other commercial insurance, what can 600,000 yuan do if a serious illness occurs? It won't solve the problem, and your future life will be at risk.
Currently, the misleading of internet insurance sales is being severely cracked down on by the state.
So in summary, the platform is fine, the product is fine, but the problem lies with the professionalism and work ethic of the salespeople.
Suggestion: The topic owner should comprehensively consider, in fact, many offline insurance agencies have more diverse products, and there are more opportunities and products for customers to choose from. In addition, some products have a better price-performance ratio than internet products.
I have helped 59 internet customers myself, providing offline products and services, and the insurance premium for each person saves 2000-3000 yuan/year.
If anyone has any questions, please feel free to communicate and exchange with me.
I am a Ping An insurance agent with over 3 years of experience in corporate management training. I have served over 1,000 enterprise users and collaborated with over 100 insurance companies. Before making an insurance purchase, I will start from the customer's needs and tailor-make insurance products for them. During the purchase process, I will strive to obtain the best underwriting results for the customer by comparing quotes from three insurance companies. After the purchase, I will handle the insurance certificate processing and policy management for the customer, allowing them to rest assured and worry-free.
Grow with each customer for a lifetime.
I hope my answer can be helpful to the topic owner!
According to the definition of the insurance regulatory department, internet insurance refers to the insurance business where the policyholder can complete all the insurance procedures independently after clicking the insurance purchase link.
In this process, the policyholder does not need to sign, and the insurance advisor also does not need to sign. All steps can be completed by the policyholder independently.
Although the process of buying insurance online may not have much "ceremony", it may not even have a printed contract, but this does not affect the validity and legal effect of the electronic contract.
This pattern is somewhat similar to the "telephone sales" type of routine work, but the problem with buying insurance is that there may be a fatal flaw in the after-sales service.
Insurance is usually a long-term contract that lasts for several decades. When we buy insurance, shouldn't we seriously consider the "intermediary" we choose, whether it is a "insurance broker" who can accompany us for a long time and provide services to us in many years later?

Just enter the promotional code to redeem it.
No problem, remember not to arrange for re-sending, I have already bought it separately, and I don't want to waste it.
Thank you for helping me.
From before to now, I have always been opposed to any form of defamation and slander, and I cannot accept such personal attacks.
In civilized society, we can tolerate everything, but we must eliminate this kind of scoundrel.
If you don't look at political parties and factions, the first thing you should resist is this kind of uncivilized behavior.
From the moment you started sending me friend requests on WeChat, I have been taking a non-responsive attitude towards you. Then, you tried to publish my so-called "home address" and "father's name" on social media, which prompted me to adopt an even more non-responsive stance.
After you, I will continue to tag you at a higher frequency than just six meals a day. Moreover, I will continue to discuss with you and your so-called friends on some hidden, humiliating remarks about me on Facebook, such as my appearance, figure, upbringing, what kind of fruit I like to eat in bed, whether I should insert or not, and so on. I... I'm also fed up with it.
How can I know that later on, more friends will send me photos and comments with sexual harassment content about you on their WeChat friend circle?
Sorry, as a woman, I can no longer remain silent.
After I reported the news, you didn't calm down at all, but rather became more and more arrogant.
I don't care about your political background or your identity status, in our society, it is necessary to respect both men and women.
Yes, you can continue with this kind of speech that is ironic, ambiguous, humiliating, and insulting. You can continue to say that you only care and pay attention to me, and you can continue to believe that this is not harassment. You can even go so far as to deny that it is not your picture or continue to publish all kinds of attacking remarks.
"That's right, I can't and I don't have the ability to stop you."
I don't know you, and I don't want to know you. My appearance and build don't need your approval.
I don't even believe that there is a woman who would be willing to humiliate herself like this in exchange for fame.
A friend asked me, "How are you?"
I said it, you won't believe it.
I think no woman can be so humiliated and still say she's okay.
Whether in the workplace, society, politics, or business, only those who have no basic moral standards will choose to harm any woman.
I believe that justice is in the hearts of the people.
I have cut off some comments for everyone to evaluate.
Nobody can impersonate you by posting on your own wall, right?
I can only say you are an enemy of civilization.
Laughter is the best medicine.
Vietnam News - Prime Minister Phạm Minh Chính attends the third Vietnam National Digital Technology Enterprise Development Forum
During the third Vietnam Digital Technology Enterprise Development Forum, two main conferences will be held to discuss topics around digital technology enterprises and national digital transformation, digital technology enterprises and the COVID-19 pandemic, and digital technology enterprises and post-pandemic economic recovery and development.
The Minister of Information and Communications Technology, Nguyen Manh Hung, said that in 2021, although the COVID-19 pandemic continued to spread, the number of digital technology companies in Vietnam and their revenue continued to grow, reaching nearly 10%.
In 2021, Vietnam's typical digital products focused on solving various problems faced by the country, and many digital products have left the country. Vietnam's digital technology ranking has also been improved.
The director of the Huang Meng department called on digital technology enterprises to assume the responsibility of developing digital transformation platforms in developing countries, and to take on the mission of these countries' digital platforms as a responsible task.
In the forum, various departments and national government leaders are currently studying, developing, applying, and transferring digital technology enterprises, organizations, and individuals to mobilize and gather all social resources to develop Vietnamese technology enterprises, cooperate in promoting the digital transformation of the country, and propose innovative ideas and solutions for post-pandemic economic recovery, breakthroughs in various fields, and other challenges.
The prime minister emphasized in his speech on the forum that digital transformation is the inevitable path of the world, and it is an objective requirement for development.
Digital transformation has become a global issue, digital transformation services cover all citizens, therefore, it is necessary to mobilize all citizens to participate.
People and enterprises are the core, subject, objective, and driving force of digital transformation.
Therefore, all policies must be for the people and enterprises.
The Premier Wen Jiabao emphasized that digital transformation needs to reflect the national spirit and should be led by internal strength, with strategic, long-term, and decisive factors, while external forces are important and serve as a breakthrough.
He believes that digital transformation needs to drive horizontal development and sustainable development, participate in the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic, promote economic recovery and development, adapt to changes after the epidemic, overcome the phenomenon of resource depletion, assist in green transformation, and promote the development of green energy.
The digital transformation needs to participate in the protection and promotion of related national cultural values, historical traditions, national landscapes, and national customs, and establish databases for these purposes. It should also promote the digital transformation of banks, taxation, land management, and development, as well as logistics.
The ultimate goal of digital transformation is to make people happier, and the country is developing day by day.
The Premier Wen Mingzheng requires that at all levels of government, all departments, and all enterprises, efforts should be increased in guiding and directing the development of digital technology, raising awareness of digital transformation, continuing to formulate and improve the institutional framework for digital transformation, and strengthening the country's governance capacity and driving the development of digital technology enterprises with a spirit of respect, communication, listening, proactivity, and initiative.
During the forum, Prime Minister Phạm Minh Chính attended the 2021 "Vietnamese Manufacturing" Excellent Digital Product Awards Ceremony and the opening ceremony of the "Vietnamese Manufacturing" Digital Product Exhibition.
I have reported it and attached a picture, but there is no reply.
What kind of cow, no cow.
It is chicken soup with fresh meat.
Can't eat it.
Are you sure it's freshly cooked food and not leftovers?
unacceptable
I have already placed an order.
Say it's 7:30 or so.
Why do we need to remake it?
Too far-fetched.

The house is actually 11 floors, from the basement 2 to 9, the basement 1 and basement 2 are both parking spaces, and parking is free during the day!
The surroundings are not very good, there are few restaurants and shops around, and the taste of the food in the restaurants is average.
This elevator is also very quiet, like someone with a serious illness, going up and down two floors, swaying back and forth, never stopping at my floor, from the emergency stairway to the first floor, it's also very quiet, directly leading to a furniture store, the furniture store is closed, and I can't get out of the emergency stairway!

The Yangtze River's mainstream achieves full coverage of green integrated services - Xinhua Net
The Yuzhong Waterway Service Center in Chongqing was officially put into operation on December 11, according to a report by the Xinhua News Agency. This is the second waterway service center in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River after the Yibin Waterway Service Center in Yibin, Sichuan, which was launched on December 8.
From now on, the green comprehensive service area on the water has covered the upper, middle, and lower reaches of the Yangtze River.
The Ministry of Transport and the Yangtze River Administration Bureau's deputy director, Qi Jianhua, introduced that in the past, provinces such as Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, and Jiangsu have built 10 green integrated service areas on the upper and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, which have been well received by the majority of ship crews and have played an important role in promoting the high-quality development of Yangtze River shipping.
The comprehensive service area covering the entire water surface of the Yangtze River is another milestone event in the green navigation construction of the Yangtze River, which marks the significant improvement of the ship pollution treatment and navigation service capabilities of the Yangtze River.
According to the introduction, the water-based green comprehensive service center is an important facility for providing comprehensive production and living services to the vast number of ships and seafarers, and helping seafarers solve the "urgent difficulties and worries" problem.
This is the first time that two water-based green integrated service areas have been built and put into operation on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. They are integrated into one body, covering life services, production services, and public services, with green environmental protection as the main theme and ship repair and emergency rescue services as their specialty. They aim to provide "one-stop docking and multiple services" for ships sailing on the Yangtze River, making the work of sailing on the Yangtze River more efficient and the life of sailors more convenient.
Three US aircraft carriers have gathered in the waters around China, and the most powerful weapon in the US Navy's arsenal is rarely seen visiting the island of Taiwan. According to a report by Chinese media, the latest satellite images show that three US aircraft carriers are gathering in the waters around China. The US media also revealed that the most powerful weapon in the US Navy's arsenal, which is rarely seen visiting the island of Taiwan, has visited the island. This move is seen as releasing an important signal to America's allies and enemies in the Indo-Pacific region.
According to the "South China Sea Strategic Situation Awareness Platform" of a Chinese think tank, on January 9th, a US Navy aircraft carrier, the "Carl Vinson" (USS Carl Vinson), was spotted near the Bab al-Mandeb Strait.
The Bab-el-Mandeb Strait connects the South China Sea and the Gulf of Aden, and is a strategic location on the first island chain of the Western Pacific.
The platform predicts that the "Carl Vinson" will be deployed to the South China Sea.
This is the first deployment of the "Carl Vinson" aircraft carrier with F-35C fighter jets and CMV-22 "Osprey" carrier-based transport aircraft.
The US Navy's aircraft carrier is currently cruising in the Pacific Ocean. In addition to the USS Carl Vinson, which departed on January 3rd, there is also the USS Abraham Lincoln (USS Abraham Lincoln), which departed from the United States on the same day.
The "Lincoln" aircraft carrier also carried the F-35C naval fighter squadron for the first time, and the squadron belongs to the 314th Fighter Attack Squadron of the US Marine Corps.
Apart from the two aircraft carriers mentioned above, the US Navy has also deployed the "Ronald Reagan" (USS Ronald Reagan) aircraft carrier, which is docked in Yokosuka, Japan.
The carrier-based combat group still includes the "Haiphong"-class guided missile destroyer and the "Stockdale"-class guided missile frigate, etc.
Three US aircraft carriers have gathered in the vicinity of China, and the most powerful weapon is rarely seen visiting the island. On January 17, 2022, the "South China Sea Strategic Situation Awareness Platform" released the latest satellite image, showing that three US aircraft carriers are gathering in the vicinity of China.
(Sina Weibo @ South China Sea situation awareness) Three US aircraft carriers have gathered in the vicinity of China, and the most powerful weapon is rarely seen visiting the islands. On January 17, 2022, a US Navy transport aircraft CMV-22B took off.
According to a report by the US cable television news network CNN on January 17, the most powerful weapon in the US Navy's weapons depot, the Tomahawk missile, was rarely seen visiting Guam over the weekend.
The Russian nuclear submarine "Nevada" carrying 20 Trident missiles and dozens of nuclear warheads has docked at the US naval base in Guam.
Three US aircraft carriers have gathered in the waters around China, the most powerful weapon rarely visits the Taiwan Strait. Analysts say this is a signal from allies and enemies in the tense situation in the Indian-Pacific region.
This is the first time since 2016 that an American ballistic missile submarine has visited Hokkaido, and it is the second public visit to Hokkaido since the 1980s.
Three US aircraft carriers have gathered in the waters around China, the most powerful weapon is rarely seen visiting the islands. In recent years, China has been building a large number of military facilities in the South China Sea.
The picture shows China's Yongxing Island in the South China Sea.
The U.S. Navy announced that the Ohio-class nuclear submarine "Nevada" has visited Guam, which has strengthened cooperation between the United States and its allies in the region and demonstrated the United States' capabilities, flexibility, warfighting readiness, and its continuous commitment to security and stability in the Indo-Pacific region.
The term "boomer submarine" usually refers to a ballistic missile submarine.
The whereabouts of 14 submarines in the U.S. Navy fleet are usually strictly confidential.
Around the secret of ballistic missile submarines, the "Thunder Submarine" has become the "most important survival weapon in the nuclear three-body system." This system also includes a launch tube for ballistic missile submarines located in the United States, as well as bombers such as B-2 and B-52 that can carry nuclear bombs.
Talked with friends about the recent Meta (formerly Facebook) crash of 26%, with a market value evaporating of $2510 billion USD. Zuckerberg responded with "faced with unprecedented competition." What's the reason?
Meta（formerly Facebook）is essentially an advertising company, with revenue mainly coming from advertising. It is currently one of the most profitable advertising companies, with its own traffic channels.
Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and so on, no matter what kind of functional orientation, they are all channels for Meta's traffic.
Not only that, Meta is also the largest "advertising alliance", many apps outsource their advertising to Meta through Meta's advertising platform, and achieve monetization.
"But the times have changed."
Firstly, due to the adjustment of Apple's privacy policy, Meta has difficulty obtaining user data information, which affects the efficiency of advertising placement.
Apple's privacy policy for users is currently very friendly, clearly indicating whether an app can access user information. Most people's normal response is definitely not to allow it.
If Google were to strike again, the impact on Meta's revenue would be even greater.
Secondly, the China factor in Meta's revenue growth has weakened (the proportion of this factor is uncertain, but it certainly exists).
Everyone knows that Meta (formerly known as Facebook) has no business in China, but this understanding is not accurate.
At least 10% of Meta's revenue comes from China, mainly contributed by Chinese companies doing business overseas.
Meta has a few hundred employees in their Hong Kong office, and several large agencies on the mainland.
Chinese companies want to expand their overseas markets, and Meta is an advertising channel that they cannot bypass. Most of the money they burn is given to Meta.
What's interesting is that ByteDance, the parent company of TikTok, is one of the main competitors of Meta, but in the past two years, Meta has made a lot of money from ByteDance.
The domestic agents are all helping Byte to advertise on Meta, and Meta's business performance in the Greater China region is also quite good.
I haven't specifically gone to learn recently, but it definitely won't be better than before.
The stage of large-scale burning of money by Chinese companies overseas has passed.
Third, the expansion of new traffic channels is not smooth.
Facebook is getting older and older, and new platforms such as TT are not under Meta's control.
The biggest problem is not just a decline in income, but a lack of growth expectations.
Capital markets are not just about current income, but also about expectations for the future.
It is obvious that Meta's expectations are not enough.
To tell a new story to the market, Zuckerberg spoke of "the metaverse".
The yuan universe is undoubtedly one of the directions of the future, but the implementation period of the yuan universe is relatively long. This story should not be able to support Meta's market value in the next two to three years.
Therefore, the next two years should be a difficult period for Meta.
Don't look at the current situation of Douyin (TikTok) now, which has a very good scenery, with an annual revenue of 1 trillion to 2 trillion US dollars. In fact, Douyin now has a strong sense of crisis, and there is no safe moat compared to other internet companies and high-tech companies.
Although his several social software brands have relatively high daily activities now, they are also mainstream social software, such as Facebook and WhatsApp, etc., but in front of the rapid development of TikTok, Facebook also lacks confidence, and the only way to compete is to rely on their own strengths.
So, the concept of "yuan universe" which is expected but not yet realized, has no hope of success in the short term. Therefore, Facebook is very dangerous, which is why Zuckerberg keeps changing his company's name and is constantly looking for new tracks. However, I think his track selection is wrong, it is a dead-end road. These are some of my thoughts, for reference.
Article 17: The State implements a registration system for the qualifications of fire protection engineers.

On December 12, 2021, the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) successfully completed the "Peaceful Relief-2021" joint drill with the Vietnamese military. All members of the Chinese participating team safely returned to China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, marking the successful completion of the 7-day training mission.
This joint performance focused on the topic of humanitarian medical rescue, with both Chinese and Vietnamese troops tightly adhering to the mission of saving lives and alleviating injuries. By following realistic standards, they completed joint command and control, joint on-site rescue, and large-scale treatment of wounded personnel, effectively enhancing the capabilities of both armies in providing emergency medical support.
The exercise results have been recognized by the Chinese and Vietnamese militaries.
The chairman of the rehearsal guidance committee and the deputy chief of the logistics department of the Vietnamese People's Army, Hoang Xuan Son, said at the conclusion of the rehearsal that the Vietnamese military doctors had learned about the organization and professional activities of the rehearsal from the Chinese military doctors, and had also seen the medical and protective equipment used by the Chinese.
The results achieved in the exercises proved the professional capabilities of the military medical forces of the two countries in the fields of medical assistance and epidemic prevention and control.
The head of the guidance and coordination group of the Chinese side and the deputy director of the Logistics Department of the Central Military Commission, Chen Chunming, said that this exercise is another innovative practice based on the successful holding of a joint triage activity in 2018, with very important milestone significance.
During the training period, the Chinese People's Liberation Army donated medical protective masks, medical protective clothing, and rapid nucleic acid detection instruments to the Vietnamese People's Army for health and epidemic prevention purposes.
