The protagonist of the University of Zhejiang's graduation ceremony was a student who presented their research findings, causing people's minds to be opened wide.
Yesterday evening, at the opening ceremony of the 2016 Academic Conference of Zhejiang University, a series of groundbreaking scientific achievements were presented.
These researchers are all students, covering various fields such as environment, machinery, energy, medicine, social science, and education. Students began from a curious point, and created many inventions with practical value, some of which have already won domestic and international awards.
Biomedical sensor: Your family doctor.
A group of biomedical engineering doctoral students demonstrated a smartphone-sized biometric sensor, half the size of a regular smartphone.
You only need to take a few breaths, and this device can detect your body's health status from the components of the breath you exhale.
Zhāng Dìmíng xuè shuō, zhè táo chuǎn xìng mièr, hǔo chú gài tǐ hěn, jìnquè bié xiàn shìjiào huì zhè xìng mièr.
Smart rings can detect health conditions on the market, usually detecting temperature, heart rate and other physical parameters.
This biometric sensor uses this new material, which is sensitive to chemical elements, allowing it to detect body health conditions more deeply and accurately.
Smart Surgery Light: Doctors' Highly Sensitive Eye.
Besides smartphones, the surgery room also uses smart surgical lamps.
This invention won a gold medal at the 44th Swiss International Invention Exhibition.
Zhulin Cheng and Junfei Wang from the School of Optoelectronics and Engineering of China University of Mining and Technology invented a Smart LED Surgical Light that does not require shadows.
Many illnesses can be detected in the early stages, and the light used in the doctor's office is related to this.
When diagnosing cancer in its early stages, doctors must examine all organs to ensure that no tumors are missed. If they fail to do so, the cancer cells will spread.
This smart surgical lamp has four lightbulbs, which can be adjusted to enhance the contrast between different organs under the light.
During the surgical process, the doctor can adjust the size, brightness, spectrum, color uniformity and transparency of the light according to the patient's needs and habits.
This kind of intelligent light has been used in the affiliated hospitals of Zhejiang University, such as Zhejiang University Hospital and Children's Hospital, and has received good feedback.
In October last year, this invention won the national challenge cup.
Use air to wash hands: Save water and heat up.
A normal person washes their hands with water, scrub their face and body with soap, and then rinse with water. Li Quizheng and his colleagues invented a "air washing device".
As soon as we stand in front of the washing machine, our weight will be able to compress the air out.
He was blowing a whistle.
The compressed air formed a fluid with the water and combined with it.
That's great, we can finally get our hands clean!
The results of the experiment proved that the effect of this method of washing is the same as that of a normal washing method.
This device requires only our own gravity as a source of power, able to ensure cleanliness and save up to 90% of water, while consuming no energy and protecting the environment.
Last year, this invention shone brightly at the Second Global Challenge Cup and won the only gold prize at many prestigious universities around the world.
Please quickly arrange a refund and thank you.
Please cancel the order and return the money, don't accumulate points, or else you won't be able to use #PRS_ORG# again!

It is of great significance to have a valid document——an urgent rescue.
This is one of the important skills certificates I obtained apart from my driver's license!
Extending a helping hand is actually done during emergency rescue operations, i.e. when rescuing people from the scene of an emergency.
It is well known that in the process of rescuing a car after an accident, the most important time is the time taken.
This is the time we need to rescue.
If I really had a heart attack, stroke, or difficulty breathing or coughing, then our life window would be four minutes, golden four minutes!
Why is it so important to have people nearby who can help in an emergency?
When there is someone threatening us, we can use professional knowledge to rescue him instead of standing still and doing nothing, which is too scary and helpless.
In China, there are approximately 300,000 unexpected deaths per year, the most dangerous of which are sudden cardiac arrests.
In the United States, 15% of people are able to be rescued.
At the casino in Las Vegas, 78% of the people who gambled were able to save money, while those in Shanghai and Beijing were below 1%.
This is what the founder of the company, Lu Le, said.
If a person experiences cardiac arrest, respiration stops, heartbeat stops, and breathing stops, there is no effect on the person.
It is necessary to perform artificial respiration, abdominal compression, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation in order to possibly save a person's life.
I discovered that few people have this kind of awareness to learn quickly in emergency situations, but when the time comes, it's too late. So I urge everyone to take the time to learn this skill, so that we can respond appropriately in unexpected circumstances.
It is impossible to save one person's life!
You can register for first aid training at your local Red Cross center, and I am registering at the Red Cross center in Zhuzhou. Students also get discounts.
The last picture is a record of the goals I set for myself 25 years ago, adding them to the list was something I did a few months ago, but I actually accomplished it!
Immediately after seeing the drowning certification in the little red book, I also saw another drowning certification. It seems that in order to take the drowning certification, it is necessary to have a rescue certification as well, so it is useful to have both!
I ordered #NUMBER#.
There are 13 shrimp dumplings!
I haven't tried it.

Yesterday #PRS_ORG# spilled food, so I got a shrimp dumpling to eat!
Because I saw that the code I input was valid.
I personally believe 'The Four Seasons' is a comprehensive film, from various perspectives.
But this movie is not a highlight, nor is it at least enjoyable.
The movie 'Four Waves' is like a monkey on the mountain, it can use countless ways to fan your anger.
On this point, Han Cang really is a true gentleman.
The most painful part of the film is the creature's resemblance to the creatures in the novel, which is hard to describe and has many holes like the clothes on the little brother's body.
After you finish watching it, you will be suspicious that there is a hidden meaning behind it, but when you think about it carefully, it is just a joke.
I find it difficult to understand some situations.
The man's hometown should be located on a certain small island to the south, and he should live in harmony with his mother-in-law.
She wishes to watch the snow and then arrange for a taxi to take her to the northeast to see the snow.
Old people sitting in a car from the south to the east to see snow?
He and his brother were very relaxed about it.
Then this old man just left without any text.
How did the female captain of the abandoned boat obtain a business license?
Why did the pigeon fly to the island, lightly tapping its feet as it walked along the path?
The taxi stopped at the side of the road and the four drivers got out to look for it.
That's too obvious.
Why would the illegal and suspicious party become a police officer?
What difficulties did the police face in the movie?
A grown adult knows how to use a smartphone, but they don't know how to use a hotel room key, so they forcefully look for the hotel staff and sleep outside the room.
This mysterious plot twists can be found throughout the entire film, making it so emotionally taxing that even when I revisit them, I still feel pain.
Besides the plot, the movie's purpose was also unclear, or it was just a shallow and confusing mix of genres.
The beginning of the movie you thought it was going to be a comedy, but 20 minutes in you were not sure if it was a drama, and by the end you were left with a deep suspicion of yourself - why did you go to the movie theater to enjoy yourself?
For most people, it is quite familiar with various movie genres, such as you want to make a car chase, then tell the audience a funny bird is how to take one step at a time towards success.
If you want to make a romantic movie, then you will have to portray the grudge between the young cowboy and the waitress.
If you want to reflect reality, you cannot include abnormal things from the normal world.
The character in the play who was burned was still able to sing, yet he couldn't go to some places due to the incurable brain disease.
As to why actress Fan Bingbing can portray a 5-year-old in some aspects, I don't know if it is due to her acting skills or the director's requirements.
He is so passionate about adding car chase scenes to his own movies that he even doesn't understand why Koreans do it.
That kind of movie arrangement in the Spring Festival, is it to give the audience a surprise?

Chengdu Vocational School Entrance Exam: Upon graduation, students will become full-time employees of the company.
Yesterday, the reporter found out from the city education committee that our city will start a "modern apprenticeship" education model in 60 public schools this year. At the same time, the students accepted into the program will be granted apprenticeship status and will be pre-enrolled as employees of the trial companies.
The school board requires that all prospective students and employees adhere to the regulations set forth by the Ministry of Education. Students must be at least 16 years old and not yet 18 years old. Parents, guardians, schools, and employers must all sign a contract outlining the rights and responsibilities of each party. This includes determining the specific duties of the student, the supervising adult, the school, and the employer, as well as the rights and responsibilities regarding the student's education, supervision, and benefits.
Schools should adopt a modern apprenticeship system and collaborate with businesses to provide employees with pre-employment and on-the-job training.
Schools should reform their talent cultivation models.
The school and the company jointly design a talent cultivation plan, jointly formulate professional teaching standards, course standards, qualification standards, enterprise teacher standards, quality control standards and relevant implementation plans.
The goal of the internship is to provide students with practical experience in their chosen field, and the length of the internship should be determined by the student's talent and the profession's training plan. A typical internship lasts 6 months.
In practice, the enterprise class management mode should be implemented according to the characteristics of different professional, one teacher can take 2 to 5 disciples as a group, to ensure that students are familiar with and practice the skills needed for each lesson.
According to the plan, from 2016 to 2019, our city will determine 60 city-level modern vocational schools, with each school enrolling around 50 students. In total, this will involve training 3,000 students (apprentices).
Following the point-by-point principle, exploring the establishment of a unified recruitment and training mechanism, enhancing students' skills and improving their employment rate and employment quality.

The China Children's Center will be holding a series of activities to let children experience "high technology" and pass the "sixth grade" - China News Service.
On May 20th, the reporter from Xinhua News Agency, Wang Xi and Shan Shan, learned from the China Children's Center that a series of activities will be held after the "Children's Day" on May 28th, such as a children's experience, children's visual art, and a children's book fair. These activities will allow children to explore the charm of science and technology.

South African doctors: The power of Mandela's message is strong, but it is not enough to treat light illnesses.
South African medical and health experts believe that the new Coronavirus strain is less severe than the Delta variant, although the transmission rate is faster.
According to Reuters, with the spread of Ebola in South Africa, a group of over 5,000 medical professionals in the province of KwaZulu-Natal have reported that the symptoms of the new cases are relatively mild, such as body aches, fever and coughing.
The doctor in charge, Unben Pillay, said that he has to see around ten patients a day, but there are still no patients requiring hospitalization.
They can usually recover within 10 to 14 days if they stay at home.
He said, "This includes elderly patients and those with health problems, who are more likely to fall ill easily due to coronavirus infection."
He said, compared to the previous outbreak of COVID-19, the patients he treated had difficulty breathing and had low blood oxygen levels.
Many people need to stay in the hospital for several days.
In the two weeks following the first case of pneumonic plague in southern Africa, other doctors also shared similar experiences.
Although enough data has been collected, it will still take a few weeks for the doctor to observe and provide early evidence.
According to the South African National Institute of Communicable Diseases, only 30% of the hospitalized COVID-19 patients are in critical condition, which is half of the severity of the first wave of the pandemic. The average hospital stay has shortened from 8 days to 2.8 days and the mortality rate among recent cases is 3%, whereas in the early cases in South Africa, the mortality rate was 20%.
Willem Hanekom, the director of the Africa Health Research Institute, cited data from the National Institute of Communicable Diseases and other reports to state that "the evidence suggests that it is a mild illness."
He said: "Now is not the time to obtain the data, we need to wait for later."
Under normal circumstances, the time it takes for hospitalization and death to occur is much later than the time it takes for us to enter this wave of the flu.
While scientists around the world are observing the number of cases and hospital rates, they are also testing current vaccines and treatments.
Despite being the world's most prevalent novel coronavirus strain, the outbreak is currently present in over ten countries, with South Africa as the epicenter.
According to the health official, the number of new cases in December in Guangdong Province increased by 400%, and the test showed that the proportion of opioid variant cases is over 90%.
Thank you to all of our supporters! 80 boxes have been sent out.

What should we do to save the children in need?
If the famous proverb "If you don't buy, you don't sell; if you don't sell, you don't buy" does not exist, in a good environment with no demand for bribery and extortion, the risky and costly behavior of bribery and extortion will not occur.
Yesterday, the Public Security Ministry's Investigation Bureau announced the launch of a platform for urgently disseminating information about missing children.
This is the authoritative channel, as well as the timely creation of an internet platform to search for and rescue lost children.
Listen to this App named "Duanwu" and you will be satisfied.
New techniques such as "cultural creativity" and emotional abundance, as well as information utilization, are practical and effective.
Search for the lost child and ensure their safety and freedom.
Then comes the trial and punishment of the suspect.
The meaning of punishment, from individual punishment, social prevention to legal education, can list many "big words".
Before attending to the sales matter, one should prioritize the safety of the victim.
It is difficult and urgent to find a solution to the problem, such as whether or not children should be subject to capital punishment. Although it is cautious to discuss, it is still necessary to help the children in need.
According to the experience of handling such cases, people tend to leave the scene as soon as they get their hands on the money.
The child may take a few steps away from the parent, and the difficulty of the case may increase by one step.
In this case, taking the platform "团圆" directly helps to crack cases, search for missing children, and it is effective action.
Finally, "打拐" is a task that requires the entire legal system to be prepared for.
To protect children and family interests, from perfecting the law to ensure justice, and from secrecy to efficiency, there is no need to cling to "protect the weak".
In addition, prevention of child abuse can be improved from the family level to the societal level.
For example, a common scenario, a family was resting at a train station, the father was sleeping, and when he woke up, he realized that his child was missing.
As parents of a two-year-old, we cannot expect them to have sufficient self-protection skills, but as caregivers, we should at least have some protective awareness.
Both parents took a break and put their child in a secure place, which is one of the preventive measures against child abduction.
From the police cracking down on criminal activities, both buying and selling children should be monitored and disciplined.
A single act is like a link in a chain, often repeated many times.
According to China's Criminal Law, the punishment for selling children is fixed at five years; for especially serious cases, the punishment can be death, and confiscation of property is also possible.
At a time when lighter punishments are trending, selling children is clearly a more serious crime than before.
There are still many shoplifting cases occurring even today.
As people's ideas about raising children become more and more relaxed, the legal awareness becomes vague.
The education system should be synchronized with the legal system.
It is not enough to simply enforce strict regulations; effective control of crime requires a multi-faceted approach.
When there is a wide presence of the market, sellers are always looking for ways to innovate their sales methods and form alliances with buyers in order to gain an advantage in the market. However, this can lead to low-effectiveness due to the ever-changing nature of the market.
Therefore, the abandonment of bad habits, together with the spread of legal knowledge, can also help to prevent and punish child crime.
Yang Hongdong was addressing the 19th Party Congress of the Chinese Communist Party and the Provincial Party Congress Spirit.
The Party draws strength from its century-long struggle.
According to the instructions of the Hunan Provincial Committee, on December 10th at 9:00 am, the Standing Committee of the Hunan Provincial Party Committee, the Provincial Propaganda Department, and the Chairman of the Provincial People's Congress, Yu Hangdong, visited the Ma Bancang Video Creation Base to learn the spirit of the 19th National Congress of the CPC and study the important instructions of General Secretary Xi Jinping. They also studied the spirit of the 12th Provincial Party Congress.
Yang Hongdong spoke about the three aspects of idealism, enthusiasm, and youthfulness of the party, as well as the leadership of the party and its principles, drawing on his own experience and insights to explain the core meaning and requirements of the spirit of the whole party.
He pointed out that we should combine the spirit of the important speeches of Xi Jinping and the spirit of the provincial party congresses into one, so as to strengthen the unity of thought, action and defense. We should adhere to the guidance of Xi Jinping and steadily move forward.
In the interactive dialogue, the representatives of the base, enterprises and youth discussed the historical significance of the three major decisions, how to understand the decisive meaning of the "two establishes", how to grasp the direction of the cultural enterprise, and how the new generation can draw power from the century-long history of the party. Yu Hongdong used everyday language and vivid examples to answer the questions, and stressed that the youth should draw power from the party's century-long struggle, tightly unite with the central leadership, and remain loyal to the party.
Approximately 26.8 million students are expected to graduate from high schools in the Beijing area in 2022.
On December 11, 20
The person in charge of the Beijing Human Resources and Social Security Bureau stated that they will strengthen demand matching, widen policy support, expand employment channels, provide assistance to struggling graduates, and boost innovation and entrepreneurship, as well as improve service efficiency in these areas.
The Beijing Human Resources and Social Security Bureau will set up an experimental platform to increase job opportunities, actively contact 40 universities and colleges to offer internships to graduating students, visit enterprises and recruit multiple batches, focus on "six-pack" recruitment, i.e. recruiting one batch of private enterprises, recruiting one batch of state-owned enterprises, recruiting one batch of projects, recruiting one batch of interns, and providing multiple job opportunities for graduating students. The dynamic management of "one life, one plan" will ensure that each graduating student has at least 5 job opportunities recommended, and will

The International Olive Council divides olive oil into two categories: Virgin Olive Oil and Refined Olive Oil, with five grades.
Virgin coconut oil, also known as natural coconut oil, is extracted from fresh coconuts, filtered, and processed to remove impurities.
According to the different levels of acidity, it can be divided into three levels: mild, medium, and strong.
Extra Virgin Olive Oil is the highest grade and quality of olive oil, it is a pure natural product.
The fragrance is exquisite, with a gentle sweetness that is irresistible. The acidity is no more than 1%.
Excellent quality virgin olive oil: slightly acidic, but no more than 2%, pure and aromatic.
The ordinary virgin olive oil has a mild taste and acidity level of no more than 3.3%.
The fatty acid content of the palm oil that has been refined and bleached exceeds 3.3%, or it becomes "secondary palm oil".
The oil can be divided into two levels: refined and unrefined.

The People's Congress adjourned, the flame of freedom never dies.
The online "People's Summit for Democracy" was attended by over 110 government and civil society leaders from around the world, including the United States. It was held on Friday, December 10th.
At the closing of the curtain, freedom's flame burns in the hearts of every person, and authoritarianism can never extinguish it.
He also indicated that he plans to convene the second Global People's Congress in 2021.
The Taiwan government representative, Tang Feng, and Hong Kong pro-democracy activist Joshua Wong also spoke at the second day of the summit.
We know that the work in front of us is immense.
We also know that we can face challenges, because I have said before that democracy is nowhere to be found.
The flame of freedom, which the totalitarian state can never extinguish, is burning in the hearts of people all over the world and everywhere.
Protecting democracy requires the collective effort of the entire society.
He said: "As the leaders of the government, we have the responsibility to listen to our citizens, to strengthen democracy, to push for reform, to make the system more transparent, to resist authoritarianism, and to pursue power for the sake of the public interest.
The second day of the People's Congress was dedicated to defending human rights, protecting democracy, and opposing authoritarianism and digital totalitarianism.
This day is International Human Rights Day.
The Secretary-General of the United Nations, António Guterres, also stated in his speech on that day that democracy is facing a challenge on a global scale, particularly the challenge brought by new digital technologies.
He said, "Now is the time to share common values and perspectives as well as democratic spirit."
This requires deepening social dialogue, addressing inequalities, fighting corruption, revising social contracts, investing in quality education, and expanding women's and girls' opportunities.
This also requires self-determination in all its forms, including the use of technology revolution to provide all the tools.
Hong Kong democracy activist Joshua Wong delivered a speech via pre-recorded video at the conference, reminding the audience to continue to pay attention to the human rights situation in Hong Kong and Tibetan and Uyghur minorities in China.
He said: "For a long time, the world has been influenced by China's rise, but without establishing any mechanism to hold it accountable."
This is why political figures and social leaders must cooperate.
We must utilize all of our resources to ensure that the reconstruction of democracy is our primary task.
Robert Mugabe is warning the world to unite against the threat of communism.
He said: "Some people in your country may be scared of Xi Jinping, some people may be worried about losing the Chinese market, and some people may not be aware of the Communist Party's threat to our democratic values.
This is the reason for our failure.
This is the reason we must change.
At the roundtable discussion on "Fighting Digital Totalitarianism and Defending Democracy Values", Taiwan's Vice President Chen Chien-fu released a video statement, emphasizing Taiwan's stance as the frontline against authoritarianism and repression.
He also shared his experience of using transparency and collaboration to combat the novel coronavirus crisis.
He said: "At the crossroads of democracy in Taiwan, we have always stood firm against authoritarianism and worked to promote global freedom, democracy and human rights, playing a leading role.
During the pandemic, governments around the world demonstrated their commitment to public health and collective benefit by reasonably regulating infringement of citizens' rights and showing a retreat of global democracy.
However, in Taiwan, we do not need to close the borders or fight fake information.
During the second day of the democracy forum, the U.S. Treasury Department announced sanctions against 15 individuals and 10 entities from China, North Korea, and other countries for serious violations of human rights. At the same time, the Treasury also imposed investment restrictions on a Chinese company that had allegedly used surveillance technology to help other countries violate human rights.

In terms of clothing and accessories for petite girls, there is much to consider.
The skirt cannot be too short or too long, just enough to cover the buttocks, which is the perfect fit.
If the skirt is short, it will expose the fat on the thighs.
The longer you are, the more people will think you are fat.
If you put on the three-piece suit, it will make you look taller, with different colors for the jacket, trousers and tie, which will give a sense of sophistication when you look at it.
Actually, many plus-sized clothing items are tailored for young girls, something the author is well aware of. Plus-sized black dresses and skirts are also a popular choice for petite girls.
Wearing dark-colored clothing, especially black pants, will make you appear slimmer.
If your legs are fat, your pants and shoes should not be too noticeable.
As the population increases, the colors should not become too dazzling.
When people pay attention to your legs and feet, you will feel plump.
For the petite girl, it is important to learn how to dress and accessorize properly.
Do not wear tight clothes that reveal too much of your body, and make sure your legs are not too short or too long. Instead, opt for a black, long-legged trouser or a net-like one (with small squares) that is comfortable and soft to the touch. Pair it with a loosely-fitting top and a stylish heel to cover up any insecurities.
Of course, the little girl wearing a short skirt is also worthy of consideration.
The fat girl should choose a color that matches the short skirt, so that the fat girl's figure will have a greater effect.
Wearing shorts with high heels allows your legs to look longer and your feet to look slimmer, which is the perfect combination for a stylish summer look!
If you are plus-sized but have thin legs, we recommend selecting a beautiful sensation dress.
However, it can also hide your flaws and show your advantages.
The dress is very slim-fitting, which is suitable for plus-sized girls. To create an illusion of slimness, layering is recommended.
A simple white dress with a short skirt, plus-sized models can also try.
The petite girl can also pull off fashionable looks.
As long as they can master the art of dressing up and pairing clothes, even the smallest girls will be the center of attention.
After making changes to one's wardrobe, one must also strive to be active in life and compete to break away from the label of being a "petite woman" 😄

A young girl was standing in front of a large wooden plank. The plank had the words "human target" and "10 arrows" written on it in Chinese characters.
Yesterday morning, a photo of a young girl holding a banner that read "Donate Now" went viral on social media.
A picture shows a young girl standing in front of a tall wooden plank with the words "human target" and "10 arrows" written on it. This indicates that the person who pays the fee can use a bow and arrow to shoot at the human target.
This behavior caused a stir among netizens.
Yesterday, the Public Security Bureau of Hangzhou confirmed to the Xinhua News Agency that the girl who made the donation was her elder sister. The police warned that such behavior is not worthy of emulation, and she had already left the local police station after being admonished.
The English translation for this sentence is "Girl Street Corner "Arrow" Donation Collection".
A woman with long hair was standing in front of a wooden plank. The plank was painted with black ink and it had the words "human flesh doll" and "ten yuan one arrow" written in the style of Chinese calligraphy. Additionally, there was her bank account and WeChat/PayPal information written on another plank in front of her.
This picture caused controversy.
Some people believe that this behavior is "shopping with a magnifying glass", and there are also many people who share the same opinion.
When we arrived at the square at around 10am, we found that the crowd had already dispersed.
The police officers who accepted the local media's interview at the scene were two young girls, both around 20 years old, dressed beautifully.
One girl is crying while playing the game, while another girl is standing next to her, helping her drink and telling her that her auntie has leukemia and needs urgent medical help. Please help.
We contacted the local police and found out that the girl is being treated for leukemia.
Yesterday, the Public Security Bureau of Hangzhou City's Xiangshan Sub-Bureau informed the Xinhua News Agency that the girl's name is JiJiaLing and she is collecting donations for her sister, JiJiaYan.
Although the treatment cost 30 million yuan, he had no idea how to raise the money and was forced to come up with this desperate measure.
He said, during the whole process, two girls acted as lookouts, one of them handling the camera and taking pictures, but neither of them was involved in the actual shooting, only observing and photographing.
The police department identified the bow and arrow used in the crime and it does not fall within the regulations.
The person in charge stated that they do not support this type of fundraising method.
After the police officer gave the warning, she had already left the police station.

The article was very popular, with mentions of project managers being able to take the lead on many projects, without any competition. Saving time, money, and effort is what project managers do best, such as rearranging tasks, delegating work, and resolving conflicts.
Reading this article reminded me of the daily struggles of project managers, which is represented by the bitterness behind their backs.
Employees who are managing projects also gradually choose to escape their work environment by taking various actions.
As the number of PMP-certified international project management professionals applying for projects increases, more and more project managers are improving their capabilities through learning.
According to the report 'China Project Management Development Report (1999-2019)', from September 2019, the total number of people who have taken the Project Management Professional (PMP) exam is nearly 60 million, with the number of people who have been certified at around 42 million, and the number of active holders at around 30 million, accounting for 31.2% of the global total.
In the past 10 years, the number of PMP certified project managers has been increasing, which indicates that more and more project managers are aware that relying on past experiences is no longer enough and that the ever-changing work environment requires us to learn and explore new paths.
However, after obtaining the PMP certification, can project management work become easier?
Many beginner project managers expressed that by taking PMP/IPMP related courses, they were able to gain a systematic understanding of project management through knowledge of the ten domains and five processes. However, when it comes to actual project management, it's still a lot of fog.
Many project managers often feedback the following issues: lack of project management knowledge, relying solely on personal experience, lack of a systematic project management process, unable to keep track of progress, unable to accurately predict outcomes, and difficulty in managing team members and communication across departments.
Therefore, by focusing on product innovation and development, we have helped numerous excellent companies to nurture and grow their product management and project management personnel, and have earned the "China Corporate R&D Talent Training Base" and "Summer Camp" honorary titles.
This is an online course that teaches project management skills by combining real-world case studies, tools, and methods to help you acquire the necessary knowledge and standards of action to progress up the project management ladder.
This is an opportunity to reduce costs and investment while training project managers, which will bring efficiency results to the company.
What other students think about this course: This course is not only taught by the Central China Star Team (the original Huawei R&D team) which combines international advanced project management theories and numerous renowned business scenarios, but also provides in-depth and comprehensive professional explanations.
It will provide scientifically useful management tools and methods, as well as abundant template forms to help students translate their learning into practical work.

Advocating for consumer rights before dinner - Economic Observer - Professional Financial News Website
This year's "Double Eleven" online business transaction amount reached 1.77 billion yuan, exceeding last year's record high.
The abundance of red packets filled with goodies, coupled with the livestreaming phenomenon, has reinvigorated consumerism in China. On the one hand, it has strengthened the sense of patriotism and boosted consumer confidence. On the other hand, it has also made us reflect on the impact of consumerism on society and the contemporary mainstream consumer groups.
Before dinner, Jing Credit Financial Company (shortened to "Jing Credit") issued a rational consumption advocacy, reminding the public, especially young people, to establish good consumption habits and reject blind consumption and excessive consumption.
According to the People's Bank of China's 20
In general, the performance of Chinese citizens in terms of financial consumption is better, but there is a large difference in terms of financial behavior and skills, and further improvement is needed in terms of financial knowledge.
Older people and young people have relatively low financial literacy, but the focus on financial education will continue to be an important objective; the report published by Nielsen and CBN's 2019-2020 China Youth Consumption Report shows that the young generation has a huge consumption potential, credit consumption becomes an important consumption upgrade path, 86.6% of young people use credit products, nearly half of them do not have debt accumulation, although the overall rational consumption trend is displayed, some young people's excessive consumption and frivolous consumption behavior, as well as the "over-consumption" label attached to them by the outside world, have led to excessive
As a trusted financial institution, Weicheng has always been dedicated to providing quality and compassionate services to help ordinary people build a happy life, advocating for consumer rights and responsibilities, and actively responding to regulatory calls to raise the rational consumption awareness of young people in particular.
In the past few years, Xin Credit has been actively promoting financial literacy among young people through various forms of activities, such as cooperating with top-tier universities to launch innovative contests and workshops, in order to guide young consumers to form rational consumption habits, plan their consumption in a rational way, and accumulate wealth for their future.
As consumers become more and more aware of the need to establish rational consumption habits and correct spending practices, it is important to resist impulse buying and excessive spending, in order to avoid debt and maintain a healthy financial future.
You have to plan ahead for consumption and pay on time according to your ability.
If the credit report is overdue, it may have a negative impact on future economic activities such as buying a car or buying a house.
At the same time, when enjoying financial products and services, you should also select legitimate institutions and channels, and check if relevant institutions are licensed and qualified to operate.
In the future, the trustworthy and reliable consumption finance system and iterative updates of financial products will bring more customization and diversification of services to consumers, helping them to cultivate rational consumption habits and moderate borrowing concepts, so that consumers can have a reliable and trustworthy financial partner for life.
I will not go.

The South China Sea Cooperation Committee is responding to the common challenge together.
The rest stop includes the countries of Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, and Cyprus.
It is worth noting that, since 2017, Saudi Arabia and its allies have imposed a blockade on Qatar, leading to a worsening of the maritime crisis, and King Mohammed bin Salman visited Qatar for the first time since then.
At this critical moment, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Bahrain, and Egypt completely broke off their diplomatic relations with Qatar, and imposed a full embargo on its transportation, accusing Qatar of supporting terrorism and having a close relationship with Iran. Meanwhile, it has a close relationship with Turkey.
The strained international relations had a negative impact on the economy of the region.
Four Arab countries have blocked the maritime route to Tarshish.
The crisis was only resolved at the January 2021 Shanghai Cooperation Organization Summit, when the member states signed an agreement initiated by the US and Russia to move towards "cooperation and stability".
Saudi Arabia reopened the border with Kuwait.
Saudi Arabia and Egypt are actively trying to restore relations with Turkey.
The countries of the Baltic Sea region must unite in order to benefit from each other's strengths and to ensure regional stability, in order to face common challenges together.
During the visit of the Saudi King to Aqaba, the two sides agreed to open two direct land corridors between the two countries.
A 725-mile-long channel connecting two countries will provide convenient conditions for travel and integration of the supply chain for the citizens of both countries.
The Saudi Arabia Public Investment Fund (PIF) will inject $50 billion into the project, and the two companies have signed a memorandum of understanding worth $300 billion.
The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) is an agreement between Iran and the world's major powers to resolve the Iranian nuclear issue, which was initiated by the Iranian government due to its inability to resolve the missile issue with the United States.
Each country in the Persian Gulf views Iran as a long-term competitor and views Iran's nuclear program as a threat to regional security.
Each country considers the Iranian nuclear issue to be unresolved and believes that Iran's activities in the region pose a threat.
Despite the differing objectives of the countries in the Persian Gulf region, Saudi Arabia and Iran have been engaging in direct talks.
The goal is to control the tense situation in the area.
This is one of the factors contributing to the growth of the Sanya Bay Economic Cooperation Committee countries' economy.
The upcoming Summit of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) will be the first ever gathering of its member countries since the conclusion of the long-running dispute between some of them and Cambodia.

This car that our team brought for everyone is a dream come true for many men!
It is the flagship model of Lamborghini, the Aventador LP700-4!
The price of the car is near two hundred thousand yuan, and the annual road tax is ten thousand yuan, why is it called LP700?
Because you have 700 horses, can you imagine how fast you could go?
It took the editor only 2.9 seconds to accelerate from 0 to 100 km/h, which is roughly equivalent to myvi reaching 30 km/h.
The low-slung sports car, the sleekly-sheathed scimitar-shaped door, the all-encompassing powerful aura emanating from the 6.5-liter twin-turbo V12 engine, perfectly interpreted the style of Lamborghini.
For the description of the car, you don't need to say too much, just Google it and the editors have prepared a few explanations that Google may not give!
Everyone is watching it, it's so exciting! (It's really cool!)
A car owner does not care about 1km of oil costing RM1.
Practicing the posture of getting in and out of the car is important, otherwise it will be awkward (because it will be difficult to get out of the car halfway).
The sound of the engine was too loud; it made my ears ring after I got out of the car. (But it was still pretty cool.)
The car is too big to park in a regular parking spot, and I'm afraid it will hit the wall when the driver opens the door!
A bit lonely because there was no one on the road (I was talking to the driver, nothing to do with the car).
Everyone should be careful, this video is not for sale, sorry!
You are welcome to contact us if you are interested in taking pictures of our cars!

Let university spirit and era spirit resonate together - New China
The spirit of a university is the accumulation of ideas and values ​​over a long period of time during the university's development, which is the soul of the university.
Throughout history, the spirit of universities has been instrumental in the development of politics, economics, culture, technology, and society, as well as the progress of a nation.
From the first modern university to be born, the mission of a university is different from other social organizations. For Chinese universities, it was founded in a period of difficulty and has been influenced by both traditional culture and the changes of time. It advocates the values of "seeking truth from facts" and "strengthening the nation" and takes on the patriotism of "loving the country and striving for progress".
Currently, the trend of higher education informationization and internationalization is becoming more and more obvious, with global education competition, technology competition, and talent competition reaching a fever pitch. This presents an unprecedented opportunity and challenge for the higher education industry.
The proposal of the overall plan for building world-class universities and world-class disciplines highlighted the Chinese government's determination to make progress in higher education and strengthened the requirements for university development.
How to quickly climb to the top of the world rankings while maintaining a certain distance from each other and accelerate the construction of several world-class universities and world-class disciplines to achieve "supercar" ?
In addition to stable objectives, clear paths, and strong capabilities, universities should also fully utilize three advantages:   First, by continuously attracting world-renowned scholars and learning from the advanced experience of top-tier universities around the world, Chinese universities can significantly enhance their academic level and quality assurance.  Second, by inheriting the wisdom of the Chinese civilization that has been cultivated for over 5,000 years, universities can promote the development of excellent traditional culture, thus strengthening their brand and enhancing their image.  Third, by leveraging the advantages of a socialist country, universities can optimize their driving forces, cons
It is impossible to build a world-class university with a thousand campuses, but each school must highlight its uniqueness and features at the same time.
China's special features include its shared characteristics as well as its unique objectives, traditions and resources.
At Zhejiang University, we emphasize three distinct features:   First, we focus on nurturing innovative and entrepreneurial talents by integrating school-enterprise collaboration and creating an all-encompassing entrepreneurial education ecosystem.  Second, we strive to optimize academic disciplines by encouraging adjustments to the curriculum and creating an appropriate institutional environment for inter-disciplinary research.  Third, we prioritize the development of international exchanges and social services. We actively promote comprehensive international cooperation and accelerate the formation of a trans-university research and service alliance.
During this process, it is especially important to remain true to the university spirit, so that the university spirit can harmonize with the spirit of the times.
For Zhejiang University, the values of creativity, hard work, clarity, and realism, as well as the spirit of Hangzhou, Zhejiang, and China, jointly constitute the university's latest description system.
This school has been steadily progressing in the right direction, accumulating cultural depth and spiritual strength, becoming increasingly rich and meaningful.
The phrase "海纳江河" emphasizes an open-minded spirit, manifesting a pursuit of excellence and integrity. The phrase "启真厚德" emphasizes a quest for truth and virtue. The phrase "开物前民" manifests a spirit of innovation, containing elements of knowledge, research, and reform. The phrase "树我邦国" emphasizes a patriotic spirit of service and sacrifice.
This series of spirits and values pursued by Zhejiang University students over the past 120 years is the soul of the school.
The sage hears the sound of silence and the seer sees the formless.
China's colleges and universities should continue to play a leading role in advancing China's unique socialist cause, and hasten the historical mission of building world-class universities.
At the same time, safeguard humanistic values and independence, let the spirit of the university and the spirit of the times intertwine, thus achieving national prosperity and ethnic revitalization, providing an inexhaustible driving force for the realization of the common ideal of humanity.

The maximum duration of entrepreneurial leave for university students in Guangxi is five years.
New China News reported on May 19th that the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Education Department revealed that all Guangxi schools will adopt a flexible education system, allowing universities to suspend classes and extend the holidays for students, while allowing students to take up to 2-5 years to complete their studies. This is seen as an effort to promote experiential education.
To promote the creativity and entrepreneurial skills of university students, the education, social and entrepreneurship departments of Guangxi should jointly build an entrepreneurial platform, and create more opportunities for university students to practice outside of the campus, university technology park, university student entrepreneurial park, and incubation base, providing students with external guarantees for their entrepreneurship.
According to the requirements, by 2020, each college and university should have an innovation and entrepreneurship practice base of over 300 square meters for undergraduate schools, and over 200 square meters for graduate schools.
The government encourages universities to establish innovation and entrepreneurship courses, prioritizing the display of excellence by students in innovation and entrepreneurship.
School teachers must spend at least two months per year engaging in industry internships in order to enhance their creativity and entrepreneurial education.
The autonomous region requires that all universities in Guangxi deeply implement the college student innovation and entrepreneurship training plan, striving to make each student participate in at least one innovation and entrepreneurship training program during their schooling.
Schools should organize students to participate in various levels and categories of creative and entrepreneurial competitions, and provide financial support.

A group of overseas Chinese students from the University of California, Berkeley filed a lawsuit against Harvard University for racial discrimination.
A coalition of 130 Asian-American organizations submitted a complaint to the U.S. Department of Education and Justice on May 23rd, alleging that University of California, Berkeley, Brown University, and Dartmouth College discriminated against Asian-American applicants during the admissions process.
The All-Asian Education Union held a news conference in Washington D.C. today.
The number of Asian American applicants to U.S. universities meeting admission requirements has grown significantly over the past 10 years, but the proportion of Asian Americans at three U.S. universities has remained roughly the same.
Studies have shown that in the college admissions process known as holistic review, "long-term consistency and systematic bias against Asian-American applicants" exist.
According to the research conducted by Zhao et al. in 2014, among the three universities, the admission rate for Asian applicants was the lowest.
The US Department of Education's data shows that both Harvard and Dartmouth universities have the lowest admissions rate for Asian students, with the University of California, Berkeley and Brown University implementing race-based admissions policies for over 20 years.
Zhao Yuguang told Xinhua reporters that they hoped the U.S. Education and Justice Departments would launch an investigation and take necessary measures to stop these universities from discriminating against Asians after the facts were established.
They also hope that the school will actively address this issue and change its recruitment policies towards minorities.
Currently, none of the three schools involved in the lawsuit have responded.
The Alliance for Equal Education was established in 2015 to challenge Harvard University's discriminatory admissions process, but the US Department of Education has yet to approve the program.
This includes other minority groups in the United States such as Indian, Pakistani, Korean, and Hispanic/Latino education groups.

In December, Mr. Land and his family members negotiated the details of the house purchase with the seller and transferred 20,000 yuan as a down payment by bank transfer.
The English translation for this sentence is: "As Lin signed as the collector on the 'Factory Buy and Sell Agreement', it states that if the buyer does not want to buy the factory, the deposit will be returned to the seller, and if the seller does not want to sell the factory, the deposit will be doubled and both parties must sign the agreement within one week."
However, after considering the scope of the sale, the payment method, and other major contract terms, the two sides could not reach an agreement, resulting in the contract being unable to be signed.
After considering that the two sides could not reach an agreement on the content, Lin gave back 200,000 RMB to Mr. Lu.
It was difficult to view the house, the deposit was ready, the contract was almost signed, but the buyer backed out at the last minute, leaving the seller feeling frustrated.
For this, Mr. Lu filed a lawsuit against the People's Court of Yucheng City.
The court ruled that since the parties were unable to sign a formal contract, it cannot be solely attributed to the plaintiff, and it is unreasonable to impose liquidated damages. Therefore, the case does not apply to the defendant's breach of contract and the plaintiff is not required to pay double damages.
After the trial, the plaintiff initiated an appeal.
Yesterday, the Second Circuit maintained the original judgment.
Attorneys should exercise due diligence during the transaction process.
When signing a contract, as the buyer, you should pay attention to details such as verifying the ownership information of the property, whether the property is being occupied by people, and the specific time and place of delivery agreed upon in the contract to prevent any misunderstandings between both parties.
Following the conclusion of the German People's Congress on Friday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Geng Shuang stated in an interview on Saturday, December 11th that the United States had organized the "Leaders' Summit" which was "aimed to instrumentalize, weaponize, and brandish the concept of democracy" in order to provoke a schism within the country and transfer the domestic tension abroad.
The Chinese government believes that over the long term, the United States has been strengthening its political system and values, promoting "democratic reform", pursuing one-party rule, and instigating the "color revolution", resulting in disastrous consequences.
Democracy has already become a major weapon of mass destruction in the United States.
This meeting is to present the commitment made during the election campaign.
The meeting was to be held for two days and invitations were sent to 111 world leaders, including the Taiwanese and Russian leaders, but China and Russia did not receive an invitation.
Before the summit, China and Russia accused the United States of interfering in their internal affairs and questioned the United States's credentials to host the summit.
There are suspicions that some of the leaders invited to the summit, such as those from authoritarian countries like Phalanstin, Poland and Brazil, have ulterior motives other than promoting democracy.
The German Chancellor Angela Merkel also attended the video-taped presidential debate.
The statement from the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Saturday, "Today's manifestations of American democracy, such as money politics, personal politics, extreme polarization, social fracture, racial tension, and economic inequality, are all based on the capitalist foundation of the "rich man's game" in the United States.
The President expressed in his speech that as the leaders of the government, we have the responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen democracy, promote reform, resist authoritarianism and counterbalance the force of special interests, as well as those who pursue power selfishly for their own gain.
He emphasized that democracy is not something that is taken for granted, "We must constantly update it in each generation and, in my opinion, this is our decisive challenge for this era."
Despite the daunting challenges ahead, democracy needs warriors to protect it.
The United States has pledged to open up to a year of action, including a proposal of 4.244 billion US dollars to strengthen democracy around the world, and provide support to independent news media.
The United States hopes that by the end of 2022, concrete commitments will have been made to improve democracy in the country.
Let us all countries fulfill our promise and report our progress next year.
He was afraid he had sent the wrong address.

The popularity of Kweichow Moutai, a type of Chinese liquor, has been steadily increasing domestically and internationally due to its adaptability to local tastes and its unique flavor.
These sweet-tasting drinks, in addition to being able to harmonize with sour flavors, can also bring visual pleasure when added to drinks, and can change the flavor of the drinks visually.
The most authentic and traditional way to drink is to mix red wine, cinnamon, and sugar (or honey).
The addition of sugar can harmonize the bitterness of the true Chinese herbal medicine, giving it a fresh and sweet flavor. Of course, the sweetness can be adjusted according to one's personal taste.
The three best ways to drink sake are described below, and we hope this introduction from the editors will be helpful to everyone.
Education Reflection: How to Let "Excellence" and "Average" Get Their Respective Places in University Examinations - New China
Three students from Lanzhou University wrote a letter to the school administration expressing their frustration with the difficulty of university entrance exams and proposing solutions such as changing the test format, so that the exams can truly reflect the students' capabilities.
For a long time, university exams have been a "hot topic".
At the university campus, students from the five lakes and four seas have different abilities, but their learning levels and learning situations vary greatly.
For groups with such diverse characteristics, there will be different reactions, making it difficult to avoid.
If the test is too simple and the rate of repetition is high, it will definitely lead to a different feeling.
Students who are not focused on studying hard before the exam may be able to achieve good results if they try other methods.
Even if you don't put in effort during class, you can still get good grades; you don't have to study or take notes, and you can still do well on tests.
It appears that the students at Lanzhou University reflect the same issues present in college entrance exams, and this is not limited to Lanzhou University.
From this perspective, three students should be praised for their effort.
In reality, many university students are clearly aware of the strategies to prepare for exams, such as studying hard and trying various approaches from teachers to obtain the best possible score. Furthermore, the phenomenon of students seeking help from teachers both before and after the exam is not uncommon, nor is the case of wealthy students bribing their way to better scores.
As seen by the writer, the evaluation of teaching quality is oriented towards measuring the success of university exams, as well as the comprehensive grasp of teachers on both teaching and learning, and based on this scientific topic.
At the undergraduate level, specialization begins, with many courses being based on fundamental knowledge.
Do you fully comprehend the basic knowledge points of a particular science, which is to be tested in a university exam?
Basic knowledge is mainly composed of scientific theories and basic principles, and the space of change is not large, fundamentally it is fixed.
As the teacher said, "20 years ago, I learned the basic knowledge of mathematics, and now I am still studying, and it is still a focus."
Although the knowledge points may not change, it does not mean that the exam questions and answers will be the same.
At many universities, exams are usually composed of several topics and are then reviewed and marked by a panel of experienced professors. This ensures that, to some extent, the problem of exam repetition can be overcome.
The task should be tailored to the actual learning situation, taking into account the difficulty level of the students and the overall assessment of their learning progress. It should also analyze the dynamic changes of the test items and highlight the basic knowledge through creative design.
Examinations are the truncheon of university education, what kind of examinations students will have corresponding preparation plans in the future, will affect the effectiveness of university education.
For the student's suggestion, Lanzhou University highly values it and has already implemented an improvement plan across the whole campus.
The instruction requires each teaching unit to organize teacher-student discussions, formulate test items and related systems, strengthen the supervision and evaluation of test items and examination processes, and refine the grading of results.
From a systematic perspective, resolving issues such as single-choice questions, repeated questions, and teacher-student interaction is essential for university examinations. Teachers should have a comprehensive understanding of the learning environment and be able to strike a balance between eating the content and eating the student's learning. This will foster a healthy interaction between teacher and student, resulting in exams that are more in line with the actual situation. In this way, "academic excellence" and "educational excellence" can be achieved.

That is my first time officially dressing up, I'm not sure if I will ever look that good, haha.
Sorry, I can't remember her name. She was very kind and the makeover was very natural.
The weather was very good the day we went to take pictures at the lake. It wasn't too cold, and the makeup artist paid attention to our clothes, headwear, and makeup. However, there was one thing that wasn't quite right, so they quickly helped us to fix it.
The photographer was very quiet, and after one day of shooting, everyone felt very happy.
When selecting photos, we didn't want to delete too many since we had seen many examples online, but in the end, we only chose 24 photos out of the 7,000+ in the package. We were shocked and scared that we might have chosen too many.
I have finished editing the photos, and Lan Lan has sent them to me. I looked at them and they were not very good, so he immediately helped me to re-edit them.
Compared to the photos that my sister took before, I am much happier with our photos. They are crisp and clear, exactly what I wanted.

The Registration Office of the Tibet Autonomous Region said that since October, they have been unable to distribute birth registration forms to newborns due to the shortage of special paper, and the number of affected people has reached 3200.

He said that the same problem appeared two months ago and Sandra also faced the same issue.
One of the reasons was that the production of counterfeit paper in China was affected by the COVID-19 crisis, leading to a delay in shipments to our country.
He explained that the use of counterfeit paper and other regional differences make it impossible to borrow from other provinces' storage.
The latest batch of counterfeit papers was delivered to our printing company on the 6th of this month and some of the printing work has already been completed.

Education News: Beijing Compresses 2016 Primary School Entrance Ratio - China News
On the 21st and 22nd of June, the Beijing Municipal Education Commission will unify the implementation of the entrance exam for middle school students in each district.
This year, the rate of growth in each district of Beijing has been reduced, and the competition for talents has become more intense.
In the example of the East District, this year's kindergarten and primary school enrollment rate does not exceed the overall enrollment plan by more than 5%, with a plan enrollment of 380 people, which does not exceed the school's enrollment plan by more than 10%.
Students who possess any of the following qualities: athleticism, artistry, and technological proficiency, and who have registered online for the specialized school entrance exam, are eligible to apply.
To facilitate student participation in the exam, the exam arrangement in the East District last year was to set up 1-2 exam locations in each school area, totaling 13 exam locations.
Students will be divided into different exam areas according to the exam schedule, and will be assessed by time periods. On the day of the exam, students will enter the exam area according to the time period and be assessed.

The President of the International Ski Federation (FIS) Gian-Franco Kasper believes that China has the potential to organize a successful Winter Olympic Games in a special period.
Chairman Xi Jinping recently expressed his expectations for the upcoming Beijing Winter Olympics, expressing confidence that China has the capability to organize a successful Winter Olympics in a special period of time.
Yesterday, Chinese Ambassador to Kazakhstan Qin Qihao visited the Palace of Peace and Reconciliation in Astana to attend the meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) Council of Heads of State.
When he met with the Chinese delegation in 2008 in Beijing, he was highly impressed with their organizational work and believed that China has the potential to put on a successful Winter Olympics. He is now actively organizing for the Beijing Winter Olympics and hopes that this will be a stepping stone for further cooperation between the two countries in the sports field.
Quiping indicated that the two countries have a special "Olympic Torch" .
The 1984 Sarajevo Winter Olympics was a success, and two months later, the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics will open the curtain and present a brief, safe, and colorful spectacle to the world.
The two countries should deepen their cooperation in the preparation for winter sports competitions, training of athletes, and other related activities. The Chinese Embassy in Beijing wishes to continue playing the bridge role, and hopes to use the Beijing Winter Olympics as a platform to promote people-to-people exchanges between the two countries, so that the two countries can keep progressing towards the future together, and let the athletes from both countries do their best in Beijing.
Prior to the ceremony, the Beijing Organizing Committee for the 2020 Olympic and Paralympic Games held the "2020 Olympic and Paralympic Games Best Athlete Award" presentation, with Qui Ping as a special guest presenting the Best Young Athlete Award to the Beijing Olympic and Paralympic Games.

The video of the military parade marking the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China was extremely bloody and realistic.

The United States has killed millions of Afghan civilians over the last 20 years.

The more human wrongdoings arouse the hatred of the Afghans.
As the video said, the American-led "anti-terror" war has become "ever more terrifying".
The war has brought nothing but misery and destruction to the people of Afghanistan, a country overwhelmed by poverty and violence.

Why would a customer want a logistics company to pack their goods even though packing belongs to the deep processing industry and is not part of the logistics company's scope of operation? This article may provide an explanation.
I have visited many milk powder factories and have come into contact with many milk powder production lines.
Their material is the same, there is no difference between them.
Why is the warranty period for a suitcase one year, but the warranty period for a pair of headphones is two years or longer?
Why is the price of listening and packing so much different?
In fact, many consumers, or grandmothers think that because the material is not the same, the quality will be much better.
In reality, the material is the same, but people think that what is expensive is good.
Consumers react differently after eating or tasting the same thing!
Now, let's talk about the reasons why it's expensive, where the expense is coming from?
What is the difference in price between their materials so great?
Because most factories consider that if the retail price is too high, consumers will find it difficult to accept, which means that the factory's profits will be low, or there will be no profit at all. So, what will the factory do to survive?
Therefore, on the pricing side, they have a very high ceiling to ensure their profitability.
Most manufacturers prefer to package their products in boxes rather than bags.
The cost of advertising per year can range from a few million to several billion dollars, where does this money come from?
Everyone can understand.
As society develops, marketing costs, such as those for store promoters, product samples, and advertising, are constantly increasing.
Manufacturers are constantly introducing new products, and their prices are constantly increasing. This is due to the rise in market costs.
Their actual material cost will not exceed 3-4 yuan.
There is still some brand recognition left, in order to promote their own product, without resorting to any means, and with the help of the hospital's doctor, from 30 yuan to 80 yuan profit.
China's related laws absolutely prohibit such operating methods, in fact, this kind of doing is to cheat consumers.
It is suggested to buy and store milk powder in a can instead of a bag, which can save money, increase the storage and sealing properties, and have no effect on children.
There are some people who think that the quality of listening is better than packing, but if you open the package afterward, the quality of listening and packing is the same, but it is easy to be damaged by the weather.

Do not tease or provoke people while they are running - China Daily
Whenever I read successful books, I can feel the explosion of inspiration.
Today's successful books, many of which are praised, are "the best principles" — that is, they assume you can "do" something and then tell you what needs to be done.
Explaining how to achieve the most important and fundamental cycles.
These books all have a common trait — either they are fervently worked on until they are done to the best of one's ability, or they are done half-heartedly with no effort put forth; either they achieve 100%, or they achieve 0%; either you climb to the summit of Mt. Everest, or you lollygag around at home.
This "best practice" will make everyone admit that it is correct, but 99% of people will be fooled by it at the starting line.
Because this path of thought blowing is a path of "you have to suffer to remake yourself and make a 180-degree turn", which is a critical weakness for many people.
For those who adhere to the old rules, refuse to change, and reject transformation, you can be sure that they are either trying to take advantage of you or are stubbornly sticking to their guns.
Most people will hesitate before making a major change in their lives, weighing the pros and cons. Sometimes the motivation to make the change comes from a strong emotion, such as fear or determination, but it is often short-lived and difficult to maintain.
Mr. Ma's iconic performance in the film 'From Tomorrow' perfectly embodied the "universal humanity" of the classic.
The greatest challenge with the "golden rule" is that it often exceeds the average person's capacity, leaving most people feeling frustrated and defeated.
Maybe, "following the rules" is a path that can allow more people to find success.
The core of the principle is to "lower the threshold" — — it is a kind of "small wins lead to big wins" theory, i.e. if you do not reach 100%, it is still better than 0%; if you do not climb to the summit of Mount Everest, you can still be proud of yourself for climbing up to your own doorstep — — it is still better than nothing.
No matter what you do, it will always be better than nothing.
Since the difficulty of the task decreased, it became easier for ordinary people to persevere, and the probability of success increases as long as perseverance is maintained.
Although following the "success principle" may lead to longer paths, the journey is still worthwhile.
At first glance, the "Best Principle" appears to be successful in motivating everyone, but in reality it is able to inspire a few while "Second Best Principle" can effectively motivate more people.

The amount of resources stored in the Qinghai Lake increased by 0.71 million tons this year, an increase of 0.71 million tons.
The Xinhua News Agency reported on December 11th that journalist Liu Xiaofei and Zhang Hongxiang from the Agriculture and Rural Affairs Bureau in Qinghai Province revealed that the latest monitoring results show that Qinghai Lake's aquatic resources have increased by 0.71 million tons this year, reaching a total of 10.85 million tons, which is 40 times more than the level in 2002.
The Baiji, or Yangtze finless porpoise, is a rare species of aquatic mammal native to the Yangtze River and its tributaries in China. It plays an important role in maintaining the ecological balance and biodiversity of the river system.
During the 1960s and 1970s, overfishing, water pollution, and other factors led to a decrease in the number of fish in the Qinghai Lake. In 2002, the amount of fish stored in Qinghai Lake was only 2592 tons.
In 2004, the red-crowned crane was listed as an endangered species in the Chinese Red List.
From 2003 onwards, the Qinghai Province implemented a ban on fishing in the major rivers and tributaries of Qinghai Lake and its surrounding areas, as well as the sale of fish and their products.
At the same time, through the introduction of artificial breeding and the cleaning of Qinghai Lake's main inlet and outlet rivers, as well as the design of reasonable "fish passages" and the continuous enhancement of protection efforts, the resources of Qinghai Lake have been increasing year by year.
The Vice-director of the Agriculture and Rural Affairs Bureau of Qinghai Province, Mr. Yang Lin, introduced the progress of the artificial breeding and seeding of Qinghai Lake, which has accumulated over 1.8 billion fry released into the lake since the beginning of the project, exceeding the contribution rate of 23%.
The Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau and the Qinghai Lake are important ecological barriers and water sources in China, controlling the westward expansion of the desert and providing an ecological function.
To protect the Three Gorges region and Qinghai Lake ecological environment, protect the aquatic wildlife, conserve the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau biodiversity, and since last year, the Yangtze, Yellow and Qinghai Lakes have all been subject to a complete ban on fishing and hunting. This has resulted in the construction of a comprehensive fishing and hunting ban management system.

The restaurant gave me a bag, and I put it in my bag, but it's still cold outside.
Do you have the item packed in a bag?
We only saw a bag.
I don't know whether someone took it or we lost it, thanks.
It has been one hour and they still haven't left.
I just read an article that was too long.
Explain to the unknown male stranger.
Most girls experience their first period between the ages of 13 and 15, and it usually happens around the age of 50.
After ensuring your physical health, you should visit a doctor once a month.
However, it is not possible to accurately predict the exact timing, but it is generally necessary to prepare in advance and sometimes the mood can change suddenly (suddenly prepare a few days in advance).
The severity of pain varies from person to person; some people may only experience mild discomfort for a few days, while others may suffer from intense agony for a week; some may have minimal bleeding, while others may experience massive hemorrhaging; some may have no reaction at all, while others may require medical attention as the pain worsens over time.
For the next few days, the moon was unable to control the flow of blood. The only thing that could be done was to use a health towel or health cloth to absorb the blood and prevent it from reaching the furniture.
Pain is mainly caused by the breakdown of proteins in the front of the ovary, which can be relieved by eating burdock root at the beginning of the menstrual cycle. There is no use eating anything after the onset of pain.
Due to high levels of estrogen and progesterone before menstruation, it is easy to get pregnant.
If you reach the period, it's impossible to hide your belly, so you'd better come to the clinic within two days.
It is best to change the sanitary napkin every three hours, otherwise it is easy to get a bacterial infection, excluding sleep time. The worst case is to change it once a day, which is 42 pieces per month. If you add the pre-prepared pieces, it may be up to 50 pieces per month.
This should be changed every six hours, but no more than eight hours.
The moon period may be chaotic and violent, but the ovulation period is unpredictable due to hormone fluctuations and mood swings, making it very uncomfortable.
Although official crime rate data can reveal a woman's control ability is very high, it will not solve the emotional problem by asking for help.
The menstrual blood is not only composed of blood, but also contains endometrial tissue.
The walls of the uterus become thicker after the menstrual cycle ends, gradually getting thicker until it is ready to receive guests. If there are no guests, the uterus is completely destroyed and a new one is built the next month.
It is very inconvenient, and has lasted for several decades, with each month having 24 hours of bleeding and pain, who would want to go through this?
Although people are born due to their mother's hard work and dedication, it was all for preparing you for your first time coming to this world and staying in a house for 10 months. We should all thank our mothers for their hard work and dedication.
In the past, many things were done to women, society told them it was disgusting and humiliating, but times have changed.
If anyone finds the thought of women preparing for pregnancy and childbirth distressing, they should not say it out loud in public. Girls should stand up, they have never experienced it before, and these men will never understand. It is incomprehensible how they could have such an attitude towards themselves and their children.
At the end, sisters-in-law, give it a try, it's really useful.
Today is the Winter Solstice, and people are disappointed.
We also need to order food for the children to eat.
I hope the store is busy checking products.
Is your electricity leaking from your feet bath?
Choosing a suitable foot bath can have very beneficial health effects, and the US editors have provided an answer to this issue, hoping to be of help to friends.
As people's health awareness increases, more and more varieties of bath tubs are being presented in the market, ranging from a hundred yuan to thousands of yuan. This gives consumers a great selection space.
In comparison to traditional home appliances, the sale of health-oriented home appliances such as saunas and hot tubs has grown rapidly, but these products lack industry standards, resulting in a certain safety risk.
In the electric boat, it is really dangerous!
Mr. Li told the reporter that he had recently bought a bath tub as a gift for his father, but his father felt embarrassed when he tried to put it together.
When Mr. Li began to use the vibrating function of the massage chair, he was surprised. His father felt the vibrations in his feet and legs.
Mr. Li was surprised to find that the water in the bathtub was electric.
After he contacted the merchant, the merchant's attitude was still good, even though he had canceled the swimming pool, Mr. Li still felt uneasy.
Because this vintage hot tub is now set to the highest temperature, suitable for all types of people and materials, there is no clear industry specification.
However, in general, bath tubs will not have electrical problems, but some products may have loose wiring at the factory.
Therefore, when purchasing a swimming pool, choose a above-ground pool.
Separating water and electricity is dangerous.
You can take a pencil test at the same time.

Ding Zilin: To Friend.
I would like to express my sincere gratitude to all my friends who have provided assistance over the past 30 years, especially to those who have helped me personally since 1994 when I appealed for help both domestically and internationally. This assistance has never been interrupted.
Most of the elderly who face hardship have already passed away, leaving their children to fend for themselves.
You have been through the most difficult times with us.
Currently, the novel coronavirus pandemic is wreaking havoc globally, with most donors having already retired.
Therefore, I sincerely request that you kindly stop giving us trouble——the Taiping Motherland People's donation activity has already been perfected.
I will always remember your love and loyalty, and your deeds will be forever engraved in history.
Due to various reasons, I can only express my wishes in this way, please forgive me!
Please accept my sincere blessing.

In 1998, MCDF established the "Six Four Orphans Education Fund" and has been executing it for 11 years. In 2009, MCDF then established the "Six Four Hardship Elderly Assistance Fund" and has been carrying it out until now.
These funds are mainly from the donations from the 1989 student movement and the public, as well as from individuals' compassionate donations, and were supported by the Democratic Progressive Party's Fund.
From 2018 onwards, I have received the support of the National Natural Science Foundation of China.
After 31 years, the victims of the June 4th incident finally received a donation from Hong Kong in commemoration of the event.
During this period, 'China Rights' also carried out their humanitarian projects independently.
We understand that Mr. Ding is calling for donations, considering the donors, and we are indeed some retired people with limited income. We would like to express our gratitude to Mr. Ding for his kindness.
We will respect their decision to terminate the project within two years, and if necessary, we will immediately resume it.
For those who have been steadfast in their compassion and bravery in delivering aid to those in need for many years, we express our gratitude and respect.

How should I give money?
The food has already been sent.
No one has received a horse.
The waiter just called me on the phone.
I want to share my programming experiences.
If you are planning to enter this industry, you can choose to look for a place to receive training, but if you don't have the notion of this, it's better to learn on your own, since the cost of training is very high and it will take 6 months to study.
However, if you are planning to enter this industry, training is the right choice, especially for those with low self-confidence and weak strength. Training is a very good choice.
If you have the self-discipline, you can choose to study on your own, but it will be tiring.
Choosing a good training institution is a very important thing.
First, we need to look at the teacher's qualifications, if the teacher's qualifications are not strong enough, then the training institution has no meaning, of course, some newly established training institutions' teacher qualifications are not particularly strong.
Before selecting this institution, it is best to investigate the students who come from this institution. After all, only the students from this institution know how the courses are like, whether they are good or bad.
Hello, I don't know how to answer your question because I don't know enough about your situation and the relationship between learning this thing and personal circumstances is very big.
Like profession, age, language you are studying, even which city you are in, these all have something to do with the industry you are interested in.
If you are a student and don't have a degree, or you have a degree in computer science, then if you have the time and resources, self-study is the most efficient and cost-effective option. Many online training institutions are available, but they require a high investment of time and money, and usually require a commitment of 3-6 months.
However, if I were to describe these circumstances, it would be very convenient, as there are many free learning resources available online, as well as many training resources available on b站. If you are unable to find resources, you can contact me and I will provide you with free resources or detailed guidance.
There are also some classic books that can be combined with video learning.
If you are not a computer professional, but are willing to invest both time and money in learning, then attending a training institution might be a good option. The instructors explain things in great detail and are available to answer any questions. Additionally, there is help available in planning and supervising your learning.
In addition, many training institutions will sign employment agreements, with stipulated salaries, to recommend students to companies after their studies, thus shortening the job-hunting process.
That is my opinion, and I gave a brief overview because I didn't understand your situation. If you have any other questions, you can contact me for further communication.
I arrived one minute before I saw the app.
What is it called?
I haven't finished yet, what are you doing?
This person will install, clean, repair, and maintain various appliances such as washing machines, dryers, refrigerators, air conditioners, barbecues, garbage cans, furnaces, and light fixtures, as well as provide professional upholstery and housekeeping services.
Thank you to those who have given me encouragement, for working hard and being tired but need to continue living.
Life will never be easy for those who strive, but those who love me will pay attention and thank those who remain silent.
Life is like this: others only see the results, but we alone experience the process, facing life, we are either strong or weak, but we must continue, there is no choice, we can only look back but cannot turn back...
Cleaning is work, but it is also a responsibility, and life is made beautiful through service, which is made interesting through the heart.
We may have done the dirtiest job, but we approached it with the most honest attitude and saw the customer's satisfied smiles and raised thumbs at the end of it all. It was worth it!
My daily work.
Your request, my service.
Service with heart, cleanliness with heart, keep beauty.
You took care of all the details, and your service was excellent. I am very grateful.
Keep the house clean, arrange the furniture, put things in their place, and clean up after yourself.
Cleaning both inside and outside, my daily work.
The crystal-clear water is beautiful, but over a long period of time it will become murky and lose its luster, only to shine brightly again after being cleaned, just like life.
When we put our heart and soul into something, we can create something perfect and beautiful.
Give me the opportunity, and I will make sure you are satisfied with the quality, since it is worth trusting, and your recognition will be my greatest motivation!
Everyone and everything is in disarray!
However, I remain confident that as long as I maintain a positive attitude, persevere, and put in effort, I will be better than most, at least in the end.
At dawn, all good things begin. May you start the day with joy, luck, health, and happiness, and keep a positive attitude throughout the day. Good night.
When young, happiness is something to be possessed; when grown up, happiness is a goal to be achieved; when mature, one discovers that happiness is a state of mind, and wisdom leads to happiness.
Strive to be the best version of yourself, walk the path with a heart, and enjoy life; life is a journey, walk your own path; life has two treasures, a healthy body and a peaceful mind, shining and bright until old age!
At every stage of life, we will encounter different challenges.
Many times, what holds you back is not your ability, but rather your willingness to face challenges courageously.
Since you cannot avoid it, it is better to face it.
The harder the challenge, the more difficult it is to overcome; the sooner you face the challenge, the easier it will be to solve.
The 1st Shanghai Contemporary Art Biennale - New China
The first Dali International Art Biennale, held in Dili, Timor-Leste, on December 12, 20
This exhibition is co-organized by the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Bi-City Biennale and the Ullens Contemporary Art Center, with Ullens Contemporary Art Center curator Wang Chunchen as the chief curator.
The theme of this year's exhibition is "Walking over Stones Across the River", which reflects the reform strategies adopted during the period of social and economic transformation in Xinjiang, as well as the cultural development of the region.
This year's art exhibition occupies around 12,000 square meters of space, showcasing six themed sections: "Walking over Stones by the River", "Transmitting as Experiments", "Borders and Reflections", "Going to the Public", "Beautiful New Worlds", and "The Spirit of Art".
Among the 27 participating artists, 40% of the works are paintings, 30% are sculptures and installations, and 20% are performances and other forms of art. 12 Chinese artists also received considerable attention, with some of them using recycled materials to create their works, such as Xu Bing in his series of "Stories from the Mountains" (2014), which reconstructs a classic mountain-and-water painting using discarded objects.
Director Bakri stated that he hopes the exhibition will create an international dialogue and provide the global audience with an opportunity to learn about the cultural and creative industries and community of Saudi Arabia. He also hopes it will strengthen collaboration and exchange between countries.
The goal of the Shenzhen & Hong Kong Bi-City Biennale is to allow contemporary art to participate in global conversations while also allowing viewers to immerse themselves in the contemporary art world.
During the Double Ninth Festival period, a series of lectures will be held by artists, curators, and industry leaders to discuss topics such as cross-cultural exchange, contemporary art development, and more.

The People's Government of Yunnan has been actively promoting the development of 44.83 million poverty-alleviation jobs in rural areas, providing employment opportunities for impoverished populations and helping them to realize income growth and improve public services.
This regulation is jointly issued by the People's Government of Yunnan Province, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, the Ministry of Finance, the Human Resources and Social Security Department, the Organization Department of the Communist Party of China, the Personnel Office of the State Council, and the General Office of the State Council. It is to unify the standards for recruiting and managing village-level personnel, fund management, post development, and post management.
In terms of development, it is clear that the principles of "division of labor, assignment of personnel, dynamic management, and total control" should be followed. Responsibility for development, use, and management should be clearly defined, with "one person one job, self-disclosure, and unified management" being observed.
The recruitment process must follow the announcement, application, review, notification, hiring, training and scheduling of posts.
In addition, the new regulation clearly defines the specific responsibilities of the village-level departments in charge of village-level positions, specifies the standards and methods for supplementing village-level positions, and requires relevant departments to periodically supervise and inspect the situation of supplementing village-level positions.

Hello
Can I cancel the order?
I re-ordered.
Did you cancel it?
Although the Rightists had a brief moment of glory in history, it was short-lived due to the intense heat of the sun and the fact that drinking water was scarce. Moreover, they were eventually crushed by the powerful forces of the state.
However, the right-wing has made significant contributions to society's progress.
From the end of the Cultural Revolution, the definition of true reality, economic development, technological progress, and the promotion of political systems and human rights should not be denied by the right-wing.
Although I don't completely agree with some of Li Weidong's views, I highly respect him as a person. This is because he is sincere, sincere in his views on China, and sincere in his views on China's social issues.
But I oppose his revolutionary views, I believe revolution is necessary, which will inevitably lead to social upheaval, disruption of people's lives, and political turmoil, resulting in foreign intervention.
Changing or improving China requires a compassionate attitude towards the people and a responsible attitude towards the nation, not a right-wing, opportunist approach.
Chatting again.
Left, it is a relic of the era and politics.
If the right has meaningful social significance, the Communist Party will listen to and analyze right-wing ideas at times when they are needed, so the left has not yet been created, because the only thing the left wants to do is to throw away the rubbish that the Communist Party has accumulated!
I recently saw some of my friends cheating and being dishonest, and it made me very angry. I felt that it was not necessary.
Don't try to reason with them, it's all just a bunch of nonsense.
Don't try to prove that we are right, and don't want to let the thief and the left-handed person admit their guilt, why?
I will tell my friends: When thieves curse you and dogs bark at you, it proves that our middle path is correct!
Many people have dreams when they are young, but as they grow older, they forget their dreams or pursue them haphazardly.
As one dreams, one walks slowly but surely, eventually becoming a dragon.
I think China is generally left-leaning due to its historical and cultural roots.
The right-wing emphasizes efficiency and development, while the left-wing emphasizes control, equity and security.
At present, society as a whole is placing greater emphasis on fairness, while the US-China rivalry is likely to continue for many years.
Although I don't understand, I'll give it a try.
What did you say? Flowers are just like that.
For the past two years, the U.S. has locked and blocked Huawei's technology, not only putting Huawei into a difficult situation it had never been in before, but also causing huge losses for "American" companies.
The U.S. has pressured China's semiconductor industry by requiring domestic companies and allied governments to restrict the sale of components to my country's semiconductor industry, resulting in a decrease in research and development investment, reduced production, and disruption of the global chip supply chain.
Now "shanzhai" has spread to all major industries, such as car manufacturing, mobile pricing, and almost every industry that uses chips has been affected.
In order to grasp the chip self-ownership, more and more countries' technology giants are walking down the path of "going global".
In order to gain control of the global semiconductor industry, the United States has been actively suppressing the development of China's semiconductor industry. Recently, it has been hosting the "Chip Summit" and inviting 64 countries to establish the Semiconductor Alliance. It has also been offering subsidies to maintain its domestic technology giants, such as Intel, which has invested 200 million US dollars in the United States to build two wafer fabs and open up foundry services.
When most people turn on the TV, it will cause a certain amount of electrical shock, and it is likely to steal the electricity from the "bowl".
That's why it's certain, because Intel has been a major player in the semiconductor industry for decades, with a wealth of talent and technological resources, they will surely rise quickly and defeat TAIwan Semiconductor.
However, the founder of Intel, Robert Noyce, didn't care much about it.
At the "2021 Teacher's Wisdom Summit" held in April, Zhang Chuangtuo's words shocked the audience. Zhang Chuangtuo was unapologetic when he spoke about Intel's involvement in the construction of the factory: "Intel is responsible for the assembly of the components, so it's not a big deal."
Zhang Chuangtuo's motive for invading the Crystal Sphere was due to his long-standing grudge against 30 years ago when he and Intel had a falling out.
In the 1960s and 1970s, Intel was the undisputed leader of the semiconductor industry and the pinnacle of global success.
In the 1980s, the semiconductor industry was dominated by a few powerful players.
At that time, the semiconductor industry was characterized by IDM (integrated device manufacturing), with chip design, manufacturing, and packaging all completed by a single factory. Intel was the representative of that era.
However, this model allows some small businesses to avoid heavy burdens, and many semiconductor entrepreneurs can only dream of affordable production costs.
In response to market demand, the chip industry began to appear in the 1980s, with companies such as Zhang Chung-t'o listening to specialize in chip design. Since they had specialized in design, they could then establish a factory for manufacturing crystals.
Shortly afterwards, Zhang Chuang's dream became reality; the accumulation of electricity generated by the Taishan Power Station was born.
This company specializes in the production of glass circles, without any design, only providing glass circle manufacturing services.
When Intel was founded, it was a small start-up facing a giant competitor.
To obtain capital support, Zhang Chuangtou had once sought out Intel for investment, but Intel only seemed interested in the manufacturing process of the chip industry, which was too self-centered and refused to invest in Taiwan.
Zhang Chuangtuo also recognized that Intel was not providing good customer service at that time.
I didn't expect to be manufacturing crystal balls this year, but now I have to start making them as well.
So, Zhang Chunguang felt very proud when he entered the crystal palace.
Today, the GDP of Taiwan has exceeded Intel.
Faced with the overwhelming power of electricity, even Intel is afraid to tangle with it.
Now Intel is attacking 3nm chips with its 14nm process, which it has been using for the past 7 years.
Wanting to achieve the impossible is not easy.
It's done.
It was 19:06 when I placed the order for two hours ago.
Today I'm going to watch some [weird] searches.
What is the normal emotion?
Randomly select three hot topics: the February 2nd dragon's head, the good price increase, and the car event, leading to a wave peak and then [smoothly decline](https://www.investing.com/terms/s/smooth-curve.html) (a curved line). If the mood is generated again, it will produce a small hump.
They look very different from the network behavior model displayed by the website.
What is the exceptional emotion?
Randomly selecting six events from the same category will result in a peak, spike, and cliff-like shapes.
The first type, 【孤峰状】, is like an individual heating up quickly, leading to public attention; the second type, 【锯齿状】, is periodic heating to ensure the topic remains hot on the list; the third type, 【断崖状】, is a collective withdrawal from the hot topic, leaving room for new tasks and battles.
In Figure 9, the peak of one event is the trough of another, and the time difference is negligible, so the forces must unite and launch a new offensive.
The professionalization of black accounts can be seen in several aspects: a few dozen hot searches at the same time, which attracts eyeballs, responsibilities, triggers competitive forces, shifts viewpoints, misleads judgments, arouses emotions, and fine-tunes strategies. Almost all the elements of public opinion propagation and diffusion are considered.
Spread is a science, throwing away all subjective factors, only visible data, even the black box will be unpredictable.
Whatever path we take, we will leave a mark, a trace, of our journey.

I chose to look at it because I trusted him and the initial budget was 700,000 to do basic renovations.
As soon as you enter the store, a series of scams begin.
When I first went to the store, I only showed them my floor plan. They didn't go to the site to measure the house, but they still gave me an offer of $135,000 for my 7-million-dollar house. They didn't know what brand of materials I was using.
Their second scam is that as soon as you enter the store, they will drag you away and take your money (unless you have enough experience and knowledge to outsmart them).
When negotiating the price of a car, they will invite their manager to tell you how much discount you can get if you have already paid the deposit.
This is an example of being hoodwinked, where I lost a million dollars in the blink of an eye while my head was spinning.
The price includes many issues, such as water and electricity renovation, as well as any doors and wardrobes, which are all additional costs.
They charge less for their services than other companies.
I lost trust in this company, and I don't understand why I was allowed to sign the contract.
When I went to look for them to pay them, they displayed a very experienced attitude, with a special team ready to face you.
Regardless of how they bite their death is the customer's problem and they are entirely responsible.
There are various responsibilities, as well as many details, that I don't want to get into. It's not worth choosing them because my friend's house that they are fixing is of poor quality and the costs are too high.
They are just the disguised dragon costumes that were originally used to deceive people. Now they have closed up and changed into something else.
Therefore, everyone should choose such a reliable construction company.
Later, everyone will check these options carefully because the cost of renovation is not small money.
You need to login or register to ask the merchant a question.
No promotion or criticism of any kind of businesses is allowed, please see the merchant's declaration for details.
We provide you with the latest information on the address, telephone number, business hours, and other updates of the shop, as well as a list of nearby shops. You can find the best shop for your needs by comparing them.
That's scary! If you haven't arrived within 30 minutes, please cancel the order!
Is there no other way? For example, changing the address?
If you don't pay me within 5 to 10 days, I will pursue the matter.
I asked 15 minutes is it possible to cancel.
The food I received was supposed to be cooked, but it was raw. I couldn't eat it.
The sky is filled with stars, the constellation of Taurus is coming on the 14th, bringing a great downpour.
A renowned astronomer from the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Dr. Zhou Rucheng, introduced the last major meteor shower of the year, the Geminid meteor shower, which will be visible on December 14th. Meteor enthusiasts can observe the shower after dark on that day.
On December 13th, 2018, astronomy enthusiasts in Beijing captured a double-star rainbow meteor shower in Qinghai Province.
Most of the planetary systems with raining stars are spiral galaxies, but the mother of the double-star raining stars is the 3200th member of the Hubble sequence, which is a Palomar-type dwarf galaxy.
The second known meteor shower is not from the Zodiac constellation.
The president of the Tianjin Astronomical Society, Dr. Peng Zhao, said that the meteor shower is similar to the one seen in the constellation of Gemini, and it will be visible from December 4th to 17th.
This meteor shower is known for its large quantity and stability, together with the Geminid and Ursid meteor showers, they are referred to as the three great meteor showers of the Northern Hemisphere.
The prominent feature of the Double Star Rainbow is its slow speed, vivid colors, and plenty of fireballs, making it suitable for both amateur astronomers and photographers.
On December 13th, 20
The meteor shower will peak on December 14th or 15th, depending on the conditions, with ZHR (under ideal viewing conditions, the number of meteors visible per hour) being 150.
Recommended Star Chart.
Last year, the twin star rain left a deep impression on people, but this year's twin star rain will be affected by moonlight interference, resulting in a slightly reduced level of brilliance.
On the 14th day of the 11th lunar month, the bright moonlight will cause disturbance to observing, but it will get better after midnight. At this time, the dual-tailed comet's radiation point will also be higher than before.
Friends who enjoy watching the stars can observe the meteor shower after the full moon rises, but should be aware of the cold and take measures to stay warm.
How can I observe more stars?
It is not advisable to observe the stars in the city, but you can choose a spot in the countryside or a suburban area facing east, be patient and wait for the moon to descend, and then you can observe the stars.
It is important to note that the amount of rainfall from the Double Star Rainstorm varies in different directions and should not be constantly focused on the Double Star Rainstorm's radiation point when observing it.
Friends who love photography want to take pictures of a beautiful rainbow after the storm, so they should choose a wide angle and bright lens, and use a high ISO and maximum aperture when shooting.
Based on considerations of stability and durability, three-legged frames, backup batteries, and quick-opening doors must not be omitted.
Peter reminded me.
What differences exist between laser TV and traditional TV on the market?
In my understanding, the traditional television referred to by the topic speaker is a liquid crystal television, and the difference between plasma and liquid crystal televisions lies in their market positioning, which mainly consists of two points: price and image quality.
The first one is to focus on the large screen market.
Compared to the fully open market position of liquid crystal televisions, the focus of the light television is much larger, or light television itself is a product specially designed for the large-screen market.
Currently, the size of mainstream liquid crystal televisions ranges from 55 to 65 inches, while the size of laser televisions typically ranges from 75 to 100 inches, fully satisfying user demands.
In recent years, the global shipment and sales of LED TVs have been increasing continuously, accounting for over 60% of the total TV market.
According to CK's prediction, the growth of the sparkling TV market in 20
The reason why the Shanghai market is so successful is due to the excellent performance of the bright television in the protection of eyes.
Based on the principle of laser television reflection, the light emitted by the laser source is not directly focused into the eye, compared to the backlight source of a liquid crystal television, the imaging process is closer to natural conditions, and the stimulation to the eye is smaller.
The China Electronics Standardization Institute and Beijing Eye Hospital ophthalmologists conducted a strict comparison test of laser TV and liquid crystal TV under the same conditions, resulting in 144 data sets.
Data verifies that the flashlight has very strong protective features, even in certain aspects having certain improvement effects.
As the importance of eye health is increasingly recognized, laser TV has been drawing more and more users, opening up a new breakthrough in the colorful market.
Second, the focus of the high-end market has been enhanced by laser TV.
The price of LED televisions has been constantly exploring the opposite direction, currently ranging from a few thousand yuan to tens of thousands of yuan, as the size and brightness of the screen improve with each upgrade.
What is so expensive this laser TV?
It is rational.
As technology continues to develop, there are many advantages that can be achieved from laser TVs, such as improved picture quality and a wider viewing angle, that were previously impossible to achieve with liquid crystal TVs and projection.
By leveraging short-throw projection technology, you can achieve a 100-inch screen experience from a short distance, with a small space requirement, a small host computer, and a minimal footprint.
In terms of brightness, premium brand LED televisions can reach up to 2000 lumens or more.
Lower the temperature, reduce equipment wear, and extend the lifespan of the television.
In addition, many high-end LED televisions also come with 4K ultra-high resolution, artificial intelligence systems, and immersive sound experiences, providing users with an even more exhilarating visual and audio experience.
Talking about real needs instead of fake demands, focusing on quality and investment, sparkling TV is not for video gamers, considering the big screen and viewing environment, you can try, whatever benefits, weigh the pros and cons afterwards and make your own judgement.
It is not economical to use expensive wide-angle lenses and reflectors to get close to the screen, which does not conform to the best optical design.
To shield part of the environment from light, use Phifertex fabric, which is expensive, but 80 inches wide can be exchanged for 65 inches of glass.
There is still one more thing I don't understand. How can the light reflected from the screen be visible to the eyes when the eyes can't see the light coming from the projector? How can the light reflected from the screen be visible to the eyes when the eyes can't see the light coming from the projector? How can the light reflected from the screen be visible to the eyes when the eyes can't see the light coming from the projector? How can the light reflected from the screen be visible to the eyes when the eyes can't see the light coming from the projector? How can the light reflected from the screen be visible to the eyes when the eyes can't see the light coming from the project
Moreover, if the projection screen is not mirrored, it will not look like the original.
The brightness effect of the reflective material was ignored, and a lot of light was reflected to the eyes from that angle, making it difficult to bear.
The camera store is excellent in terms of quality and selection, but it doesn't have any branches yet.
When she added a date to her calendar, she quickly organized the available time and replied to me promptly.
I watched the artwork in the store before leaving, and there were more outdoor wedding photos, which were very beautiful. The photography style involved was diverse.
After we had discussed our ideas and she was very patient in helping me find the right style of clothing, she finally started to get ready for the photoshoot. The photographer gave some directions and guided the action, paying attention to every detail.
Although I didn't have a specific shooting idea in mind, the result was not what I wanted, but it still looks good.
After the photographer has finished taking the picture, they will select the best shots, have a friendly conversation with the subject, and pay close attention to detail.
It takes about half a month to finish the task, and it has the same effect.
The royal court's photography activity was a great success! Everyone was able to choose a piece of clothing to be photographed in.
He chose a black suit, experiencing a different style.
The whole shooting process takes about two hours, including makeup and shooting. The photographer is my brother, who is 25 years old. He seems a bit inexperienced, so I hope I can give him more advice in the future and make the shooting process more enjoyable.
The English translation for this sentence is: "The photography gallery offers superior quality products and services."
He went to the home page and also checked out Queenie~
You went to the store and filled out your name and phone number before selecting clothing. You tried on several outfits and were very patient, and the service was great. Afterward, you got your makeup and hair done, and it felt like you were posing for a photo. It took about a month to receive the photos, and they seemed identical to the original.
The environment is still good.
There are many choices of clothing.
The difference between makeup positions is not much, there is a photography table nearby.
Service is very warm and attentive.
The teacher is very patient.
The photographer will be very attentive in teaching you the moves.
The photographer will also suggest retouching.
Experience has changed somewhat, the original double eyelid has been replaced with three.
Eyebrows were also shaved, which made everyday life a bit inconvenient.
The photo gave me ten likes, but the P picture effect was not satisfactory; it felt like there was too much makeup on.
Because it was not clear what style to choose, she tried two options and finally chose the black ceremonial robe. The little girl said that this one was more classic and elegant.
After selecting clothing, the stylist and makeup artist worked hard to perfect the look. I was very satisfied with the outcome.
After getting dressed, the photographer directed me to pose in different ways and the whole process was very smooth and harmonious.
After he finished watching the 15th episode, his brother said he was very satisfied.
You have not replied for 3 days due to your system being unable to recognize my credit card, so I cannot add #PRS_ORG# to my monthly fee!
The strangest thing is that I always use the same credit card when I pay.
I have to pay shipping every time.
Can you first pay me back the money you owe me and then investigate the matter afterwards?
Are you buying an umbrella?
A web-based insurance brokerage platform.
According to the Insurance Regulatory Guidelines of 2015 (revised), in order to become an insurance company, the following criteria must be met: the shareholders must have no major violations within the past three years, the minimum capital is 5 million yuan, and the company must be approved by the China Insurance Regulatory Commission.
This is very difficult, the conclusion is that it requires strength, going through the approval of the national authorities, the shareholders must have a good wind, as a small umbrella insurance, the insured is not suspicious, and the insurance company can reach this.
On this point, there is nothing wrong, it is worth believing in.
From insurance products: Small umbrella insurance is a insurance marketplace, where many companies' celebrities sell their super risks, such as the newly released and luxurious Maybach 5 super risks, with both the insured and the guarantor being Thai people. Small umbrella insurance is just an intermediary, without any suspicion of its own.
From the fee-based model perspective, internet products, due to the absence of brick-and-mortar store costs and labor expenses, tend to have higher prices than traditional products, while the fee-based model is flexible and supports various payment options, such as monthly payments and reduced insurance premiums, thus maximizing the potential of insurance products.
That's not bad.
You can consider it.
From an insurance professional's perspective, this is very important because the insurance industry requires a high degree of professionalism. Many online product customers can self-insure, which can lead to a lot of misinformation and misrepresentation, especially in the health and professional fields. Insurance professionals often add their own subjective judgement when assessing risks, which can easily lead to disputes and even rejection of claims.
I have done insurance sales over the phone, just like with Alibaba, which is an online insurance platform. I am very responsible for telling everyone this.
The insurance offered by the internet is real, but it is unreliable, as it is operated by non-professionals and there is a lot of misleading information.
For example, if you buy a policy with a premium of 1 million yuan, you can get a free phone worth 600,000 yuan and a discount of up to 6 million yuan in medical expenses. These marketing strategies may not be wrong, but they are too good to be true. You only need to pay 1 million yuan upfront and the rest can be paid monthly with no extra cost. However, it is unclear how long the customer will have to pay for the phone and how much they will have to pay for the medical expenses.
It is possible to earn one block of gold, and the insurance company will pay 600 million (the whole world is gone).
Free mobile phones are sent out with special numbers such as 6666 and 8888, and if you win the lottery, you will not exchange it and no one will notify you.
For the insured, it is just another hole in the ground. It is a short-term solution if there are no other business risks, but 6 million can't possibly solve the problem and will only postpone the inevitable running away from life.
Incorrect information about online insurance sales is being aggressively combatted by the government.
Therefore, looking at the platform, there is no problem, neither is there a problem with the product, the issue is with the professionalism and work ethic of the staff.
It is advisable to weigh the risks carefully, as there are many insurance companies offering a wide range of products with more opportunities and choices for customers, as well as competitive pricing.
I have helped 59 online customers, guaranteeing the product and charging fees of 2000-3000 yuan per year.
If you have any questions, please feel free to communicate and exchange with me.
I am an insurance broker with three years of business management training and experience servicing over a thousand companies. I have collaborated with over 100 insurance companies and always start from the customer's needs when designing insurance products, strive to get the best coverage during the bidding process, and meticulously handle paperwork and follow up with customers after the sale.
Grow together with each customer for life.
I hope my answer can be of help to the topic owner!
According to the definition of the Insurance Supervision Department, online insurance is a self-service process that can be completed by clicking on the insurance link after providing personal information.
In this process, neither the insured nor the insurance advisor needs to sign any documents, and all steps can be completed by the insured person themselves.
Although there is no "ceremony feeling" in online insurance, it does not affect the validity and legal force of electronic contracts.
This mode is similar to a typical telephone sales job, but buying insurance has a potentially fatal problem—the subsequent service may not live up to expectations.
Insurance is usually a binding contract lasting several decades, so when buying insurance, we should carefully consider the "intermediary" we choose, as this could be a long-term companion and provide services over many years.
How can I contact the restaurant staff?
It's already 3 o'clock.
That is not supposed to be given to me compensation.
I want to open the door and send something.
But the rider dismounted at the door and people walked away.
He still owes me money.
Your horse has already taken my item from #NUMBER#, but it is still in the waiting queue.
My buyer received my item at 19:25, but they still haven't shipped it.

How do I do that?
Your horse has gone where?
Do I have to wait?
I am sending a package.
Good, you don't cancel, I will report.

Thank you for your help.
From the past to the present, I have always opposed any form of defamation and verbal abuse, and I cannot accept such behavior.
In a civilized society, we can accept anything, but we must eliminate this kind of evil.
If you don't support the party or faction, you will be suppressed, which is inhumane.
From the moment you sent the friend request, you have been trying to charm me with your posts, and then you tried to publish my home address and father's name on social media. I have not responded to your attitude.
You kept talking about me behind my back even after I had already forgiven you. You discussed my private matters such as my sleeping habits, physical appearance, diet, hygiene, and so on. You even talked about planting grass on my bed and whether or not I should be allowed to have a pet. All of this was inexcusable.
I was surprised to receive so many messages from my friends after I posted a picture of my face on social media.
Sorry, as a woman, I couldn't continue to be silent.
After I reported the news, you became more and more excited.
I don't care what your political background is or what your identity is, in our society, we need to show respect to both genders.
You can continue to use derogatory language, insults, humiliation, and criticism. You can also continue to believe that it is not disturbing, that it is not you who has made the picture or continue to post attacking speech.
No, I can't, and I don't have the ability to stop you.
I don't recognize you and I don't want to recognize you, and my appearance and body do not need your opinion.
I don't think any girl would be willing to be humiliated like that just to get a new name.
My friend asked me, "Are you doing well?"
I said hello, but you didn't believe me.
I think no one can replace her and still be as good.
Regardless of work, society, or politics, only those who lack basic human decency will choose to harm any woman in such a way.
I believe, goodness lies in the heart of every person.
I have edited and approved the comments for everyone.
Nobody can benefit from your response.
I can only say that you are my enemy.
He/She is smiling.

Recently, the value of Meta has plummeted by 26%, and its market capitalization is 2510 million US dollars. Why did this happen?
Facebook is essentially an advertising company, which earns most of its revenue from advertising. It is today's most profitable advertising company, with its own traffic channels.
No matter what kind of function it is, Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp, etc., are all Meta's traffic channels.
Not only is it the largest advertising alliance, but many apps rely on Meta's advertising platform to appear.
However, times have changed.
Because of the adjustments to Apple's privacy policy, Meta finds it difficult to obtain user data, which has affected the efficiency of advertising.
Apple's privacy policy is very user-friendly and will clearly indicate whether users allow the app to access their information. Most people's normal reaction is to not allow it.
If Google slices again, the impact on Meta's income will be even greater.
Second, the growth of China's income has weakened (the weight of this factor is uncertain, but it definitely exists).
Everyone knows that Meta is not doing business in China, but this understanding is not accurate.
At least 10% of a company's income comes from China, mainly from Chinese companies involved in maritime activities.
There are about a hundred people in the Hong Kong office, and there are several dozen agents on the mainland.
China Company Wants to Expand Overseas, Advertising is the Key, Spent a Lot of Money on It.
It is clear that TT is one of the major competitors of Meta, but in the past two years, Meta has made a lot of money from TT.
Agents from all over China are going to Meta to post ads, and the performance of the Chinese region of Meta is not bad.
I haven't studied recently, but I'm sure it will be better than before.
The stage of Chinese companies investing large sums of money overseas has already passed.
The third reason is that the new channel expansion is not going smoothly.
Facebook is getting older, but the new platforms such as TT included in it are not in Meta's hands.
The biggest problem is not only a decrease in income, but also a lack of growth expectation.
The stock market is not only about looking at past earnings, but also about anticipating the future.
It is evident that Meta's expectations were not met.
In order to tell the market a new story, Zuckerberg told the audience "The Universe".
The universe should be one of the directions of the future, but its realization cycle is comparatively long. This story should not be able to support the value of Meta in three years.
It will be more difficult in the future compared to the present.
Don't look now, but the winds of change are blowing, with an estimated $1,000 to $2,000 million in annual income. In comparison to other internet companies and high-tech firms, it lacks any real security measures.
Although there are many popular social media platforms now, such as Facebook and WhatsApp, TikTok's rapid growth has made them feel insecure, and they are resorting to underhanded tactics to stay afloat.
This concept, which is impossible to achieve in a short period of time, is extremely risky, and this is why Kepler changed his name and was constantly searching for new paths, but I believe his choice was wrong, as it was a wrong turn. These are my thoughts, for reference.
