Is there any way to punish him?
To prevent this from happening again.
Can you tell me how long it will take for the restaurant to be ready?
Students singing lead roles at the university's Annual Meeting, research results are mind-blowing - Xinhua News Agency
Last night, at the opening ceremony of Zhejiang University's 2016 academic year, a series of brilliant academic achievements were recognized.
The main authors of these results are students, whose research covers a wide range of fields such as environment, mechanics, energy, health, life sciences, humanities and education. The students started with a curious idea and created many high-end inventions with applied value, some of which have won national and international awards.
Biosensors: your family doctor
A team of PhD students from the Faculty of Biomedical Engineering, Zhang Diyuan, demonstrated a bio-sensor for a smartphone, half the size of a smartphone.
All you have to do is take a breath, and this instrument will give you a preliminary reading of your health from the composition of the gases you exhale.
According to Zhang, the sensor is connected to a smartphone, and when the gas is exhaled, the health report is displayed on the phone.
Smart wristbands on the market are able to detect health status, usually by detecting physical parameters such as temperature, pulse, etc.
The bio-sensor uses a new material, graphene, to target chemical elements, and its acute sense of smell gives it a deeper and more accurate picture of a person's health.
Smart surgical lights: the high-energy eyes of doctors
In addition to smartphones, the operating room is equipped with smart surgical lights.
The invention won a silver award at the 44th International Exhibition of Inventions in Geneva, Switzerland this year.
The team of Ph.D. students Julin Jing and Shen Junfei from the Faculty of Photonics and Electrical Science and Engineering has opened a new way of thinking about the shortcomings of traditional surgical lights, inventing a smart LED surgical light without shadows.
Many diseases are not detected and eliminated early, and are related to the lights used in the doctor's operating room.
Shen Junfei said that if the doctor does not see all the tumor tissue in time, for example, when the cancer is examined early, then the cancer cells will spread afterwards.
This smart surgical light has four discs that enhance the differentiation of different tissues under the light by adjusting the spectrum.
During surgery, the doctor can adjust the size, brightness, spectrum, color uniformity, and shadowlessness of the spot at any time, depending on the needs of the surgery and personal habits.
The smart surgical light has been tested in Zhejiang University Medical School-affiliated Liu Yifu Hospital, Zhejiang University Medical School-affiliated Children's Hospital and other hospitals, and has received good feedback.
In October last year, the invention was awarded first prize in the National Challenge Cup.
Washing Hands with Air: Saving Water and Cooling
Ordinary people wash their hands by rinsing with water, scrubbing with soap as much as possible, and squeezing with hand washing liquid, while Li and his classmates invented a set of vacuum air hand washing devices.
As soon as we stand on the device's sink, our weight can compress the air and let it out.
It's like a breathing tube.
Compressed air forms a liquid at the faucet and combines with the water.
That way we can wash our hands clean!
Chromatography and bacterial residue experiments demonstrated that this method of washing hands is as effective as the usual method of washing hands.
This device relies only on our own gravity for propulsion, ensures cleanliness and saves 90% of water, the whole process is completely energy-efficient and environmentally friendly.
Last year, at the second Global Major Challenges Summit, the invention stood out among many of the world's top universities, winning the only gold prize.
Please arrange a replacement for me as soon as possible, thx
Please cancel your order and get your cash back, no credit, no more #PRS_ORG#!
It's not good for children to eat spinach with bones.
If so, please order as soon as possible.
No, thank you.
He asked me to tell you where he is. #PRS_ORG
I can't wait to cancel my order.
I bought #PRS_ORG#, but I wrote the wrong address
Can it be changed?
Or cancel the order.
Okay, that's enough of that.
A certificate that makes a lot of sense is called an E.R. card.
This is one of the skills I consider important besides my driver's license!
Let's generalize it: first aid measures are actually emergency rescues in the event of an emergency, that is, rescues before the arrival of an ambulance.
As we all know, there is a period of time between the arrival of the ambulance and the accident, and this period is the most crucial.
This is the time when emergency services are needed.
If I do have a heart attack, cerebral hemorrhage, respiratory arrest, then our life window is four minutes, golden four minutes!
So the people around you know how important first aid is!
When someone around us falls, we can use our expertise to rescue them, instead of standing there and doing nothing, the feeling of helplessness is too frightening.
In China, according to our official data, there are three million accidental deaths every year, the most dangerous of which is a cardiac arrest.
In the United States, the average survival rate is 15 percent.
At casinos in Las Vegas, the survival rate is 780 percent, and in Shanghai and Beijing it is less than 1 percent.
This is the first reaction from the founder Lu Lu.
If a person has a cardiac arrest, no more breathing, no more heartbeat, there is no effect on you.
It is necessary to perform artificial respiration and chest compressions in order to be able to save the person.
I noticed that very few of us today have the awareness to learn first aid, but we don't have the time when things happen, so I urge everyone to learn this skill so that we can react in a timely manner in the face of emergencies.
It may save one person's life!
You can apply at your local Red Cross training center, I applied at the Red Cross training center in Zhuhai, and there are discounts for students.
PS: The last picture is a list of my goals to accomplish before I'm 25, and adding a first aid kit to the list of goals was a few months ago, but it's done!
Then I went to the other certificates I wanted to take, I was going to take a diving certificate, before I saw a diving first aid certificate in the little red book, this certificate seemed to have to have a first aid certificate before I could take the exam, so in fact, the first aid certificate is very useful!
I ordered ##NUMBER#
One of them cost 13 yuan?!
I haven't tried it yet.
Why isn't #NAME# written clearly?
Do they cost $13 each?
Yesterday #PRS_ORG# dropped food, this time I got a chicken to eat!?
Because knowing that I've seen it before when I've typed in the code has worked.
To conclude, I personally think that The Four Seasons is an all-round mess, in every sense of the word.
But if you're going to say that this movie is not a highlight, it's not even a good soundtrack.
There are many kinds of bad movies, one that makes you fall asleep in the theater, another that makes you feel angry after watching it, and another that makes you feel like a rabbit on your eyebrow, which can ignite your anger in countless ways.
Han Kang really is a genius at insulting the audience.
The most painful thing about this film is that it is like a creation from a K-pop novel, it is difficult to name, it is full of holes, like the robe on Little Marco.
Even after watching it, you might wonder if there is a director's metaphor in it, but when you think about it, it's just a joke.
Let me start by briefly describing some of the things that are difficult for me to understand.
The man's residence is supposed to be on a small island in the far south, and his grandmother is dependent on him for his livelihood.
Her grandmother had a desire to see the snow, so the show arranged for a neighbor to drive her to the northeast to see the snow in a small van.
Elderly people in vans watching snow from south to northeast
He and his mother are very reassured about this.
Then the old man disappeared.
How did the owner's brother get a business license to open a hotel on an abandoned ship?
Why is it so easy for the island's flying car party to block a section of the mountain road?
Then the truck that was delivering the steel bar in the middle of the road stopped on the side of the road, and not even the truck driver could be found around.
It's too obvious that this is a prop, isn't it?
Why would a small, shoddy motorcycle gang with no credentials and suspicions of wrongdoing become an auxiliary police officer?
In the film, the policeman specifically asks if there is any difficulty in not calling the police when faced with a high-risk loan.
An adult who knows how to use a smartphone, but doesn't know how to use a keycard to open a door in a hotel, then forcibly arranges to sleep outside the door of the hotel without finding the owner?
The film is full of such bizarre scenes that it pains me to recall them because they are so bizarre.
Aside from the plot, what's worse is that the film's theme, or no theme at all, is a hideous monstrosity.
At the beginning of the film, you think he wants to make a comedy film, after 20 minutes you guess it might be an inspirational film, after half of the movie you think it might be a drama about small-town youths struggling to survive, and after watching it you don't even know if you've seen a joke, followed by deep doubts about yourself, why run to the cinema to enjoy the urine at the end of the year.
For most people, the plot of the movie is very familiar, for example, if you want to shoot a motorcyclist, then inspire + comedy and then tell the audience how a talented rookie gets to success step by step.
If you want to make a romance movie, you should tell the truth about the animosity between a small town boy who likes to ride motorcycles and a waitress's sister.
If you want to reflect reality, then at least your story can't be something that contradicts the normal world.
(For example, the new motorcycle that Yang Zheng plays has just been burned, and the role of the singer) can't open some brain holes that even Kennedy didn't see.
I don't know if it's because of the acting or because of the director's request.
There's something else I don't understand, why is Han Kang as a racing driver so keen on adding a crash scene to his own film?
Is this kind of film in the Spring Festival line-up to add to the audience's enthusiasm?

Chongqing's secondary vocational schools pilot modern apprenticeship system, enrolled as employees of enterprises - Xinhua News Agency
Yesterday, reporters learned from the city's education committee that starting this year, the city will pilot a modern apprenticeship-based talent development model in 60 secondary schools. Students who participate in the pilot training will also have the status of apprentices, and after enrollment, they will be pre-recruited by the pilot enterprises as employees of the unit.
The Municipal Teaching Committee required to regulate the admission and employment procedures of secondary vocational schools, clarify the dual status of secondary school students and enterprise employees of apprentices, in accordance with the two-way selection principle, apprentices, schools and enterprises sign a tripartite agreement, for apprentices aged 16 years and under 18 years of age, an agreement must be signed by apprentices, guardians, schools and enterprises, to determine the rights and interests of all parties and the specific positions, teaching content, rights and interests of apprentices in the nursery.
The pilot schools are encouraged to conduct pre-retrenchment and transfer training for employees of enterprises in collaboration with the cooperating enterprises in the form of modern apprenticeships.
The pilot school aims to reform the model of talent development.
Schools and enterprises jointly design talent development programs and jointly develop professional teaching standards, curriculum standards, job standards, entrepreneurship standards, quality monitoring standards and corresponding implementation programs.
The pilot program is based on the training curriculum as a pilot cycle, the student's internship time in the company is determined according to the professional talent training program, and the maximum internship is usually 6 months.
In corporate practice, the corporate group management model should be implemented. Depending on the characteristics of different professions, one teacher can take 2 to 5 apprentices to form study groups to ensure that students master the skills required for each round of training.
According to the arrangement, from 2016 to August 2019, our city has identified 60 city-level intermediate-level modern apprenticeship pilot centers in three batches, each with about 50 people, training about 3,000 students in total.

South African doctor: Omicron is highly contagious, but mostly mild
Many doctors and medical experts in South Africa believe that the Omicron variant of the coronavirus is less pathogenic than the Delta variant, although it spreads faster.
According to the Associated Press, as the Omicron variant spreads in South Africa, a group of more than 5,000 doctors in the Haudenosaunee Province of South Africa reports that the new coronavirus patients they are currently treating are experiencing relatively mild symptoms, such as body aches and coughing and flu-like symptoms.
The group's director, Dr. Unben Pillay, says he sees dozens of patients every day, but none of them require hospitalization.
They were able to control the disease at home, and most people recovered within 10 to 14 days of being quarantined.
This includes elderly patients and those with health problems, who are more likely to become seriously ill due to coronavirus infection, he said.
In comparison, he said, during the last wave of the Delta outbreak, the new coronavirus patients he treated had breathing difficulties and low blood oxygen levels.
Many of them will be hospitalized in a few days.
Within two weeks of the first report of the Omicron variant in southern Africa, other doctors shared similar experiences.
While it will take weeks to gather enough data, doctors' observations and early evidence provide some clues.
According to South Africa's National Institute of Infectious Diseases, only 30% of new coronavirus patients hospitalized in recent weeks had severe illness, half the rate of severe illness in the previous wave of the epidemic; the average length of hospitalization was reduced from 8 days to 2.8 days; only 3% of recent coronavirus patients died, compared to 20% in the earlier outbreaks in South Africa.
Citing data from the National Institute of Infectious Diseases and other reports, Willem Hanekom, director of the African Health Institute, said: "At the moment, almost all indications are that it is a mild disease".
He added: "It's still early days and we need to have the latest data".
Usually, hospitalizations and deaths occur later, and we're only two weeks into this wave of the epidemic.
At the same time, scientists around the world are observing the number of cases and hospitalizations, as well as testing the effectiveness of current vaccines and treatments.
Although Delta remains the world's leading strain of coronavirus, cases of mumps are emerging in dozens of countries, with South Africa being the epicentre of the outbreak.
According to health officials, there was a 400% increase in new cases detected in Haudenosaunee during the first week of December, with tests showing that the Omicron variant accounted for more than 90% of cases.
Thanks to our supporters today, all 80 boxes have been distributed!

Comments Off on Education: What to do to save kidnapped children?
If, as the well-known public service announcement says, there is no such thing as a mercenary without a mercenary, there is no such thing as a mercenary without a mercenary, then there is no such thing as a mercenary without a mercenary without a mercenary without a mercenary, and in a good environment where there is no such thing as a mercenary without a mercenary, there is no such thing as a mercenary without a mercenary without a mercenary, there is no such thing as a mercenary without a mercenary without a mercenary without a mercenary without a mercenary without a mercenary without a mercenary without a mercenary without a mercenary without a mercenary without a mercenary without a mercenary without a mercenary without a mercenary without a mercenary without a mercenary without a mercenary without a mercenary without a mercenary without a mercenary without a mercenary without a mercenary without a mercenary without a mercenary without a mercenary without a mercenary without a mercenary without a mercenary without a mercenary without a mercenary without a mercenary
Recently, the Ministry of Public Security's Criminal Investigation Bureau developed an emergency platform to release information on missing children.
This is an Internet information platform created to establish an authoritative channel for the publication of information about missing children and the timely recovery of abducted children.
When I heard the name of the app, it was heartwarming.
The new technological means are not only the name, but also the literature, and the emotions, and the information is used correctly, practically, and effectively.
The primary goal of law enforcement is to recover the kidnapped children and protect their personal safety and freedom.
The second is the trial and punishment of the suspects.
The meaning of criminal punishment, from individual punishment to social prevention to legal education, can be summed up in many big words.
However, prioritizing the personal safety of the victims should be a priority until the trafficking case is solved.
It is a matter of urgency, and the more controversial subjects, such as whether the death penalty should always be imposed for the trafficking of children, can be discontinued and discussed with caution, but not the rescue of kidnapped children.
According to the experience of investigating such cases, traffickers tend to move away from the crime scene as soon as they are caught.
Every minute that the search is delayed, the child may be further away from the family, and the case will be more difficult to solve.
In this case, it's really pragmatic to come up with a platform like the Oval Office, which directly helps to solve cases and find effective ways to get the child back.
After all, kidnapping is a big job that requires the entire legal system to function properly.
Combating crime, safeguarding the rights of children and parents, from the integrity of legislation, to the protection of justice, and the secrecy of law enforcement, there is no need to implement care for children and vulnerable mothers.
Moreover, the prevention of child trafficking, from the family to the society, can be done better.
For example, in one common case, a family of three was resting at a train station, and the parents fell asleep, only to wake up to find that their children were missing.
You can't expect a two-year-old to have adequate self-protection skills, but as a parent of a young child, you should at least have adequate protection awareness.
Parents taking turns resting their children, or placing them under proper protection, is the least we can do to prevent child abduction.
From the other side of the police's crackdown on trafficking, buyers of kidnapped children should also be considered and punished.
Individual wrongdoing is often just one link in a long chain.
According to China's Penal Code, child trafficking is punishable by up to five years in prison; in particularly serious cases, it is punishable by death and confiscation of property.
Child trafficking is clearly one of the most severely punished crimes in the world, with a growing trend towards lightening the penalty for child trafficking.
However, there are still many cases of trafficking every year.
It is clear that some people are lagging behind in their conception of child rearing, and their legal awareness is weak.
The legal education of this group should be synchronized.
To effectively control human trafficking, it is not enough to rely on strict official enforcement.
If the market for kidnapping is widespread, and the traffickers are greedy and constantly innovating their methods of trafficking, creating a situation where they struggle with law enforcement, the kidnapping operation will inevitably fall into an inefficient quagmire.
Therefore, breaking the backward mentality and spreading the common sense of the law can also help to eradicate the crime of child trafficking and buying and selling.

The restaurant kept saying it was in the process.
We waited for hours.
The International Olive Oil Association divides olive oil into two broad categories, namely Virgin Olive Oil and Refined Olive Oil.
Extra virgin olive oil, also known as natural olive oil, is olive oil obtained directly from fresh olives by mechanical freezing, filtering, and removal of foreign matter.
The difference in acidity can be divided into three levels:
Extra virgin olive oil is the highest grade, highest quality olive oil and is a pure natural product.
It tastes great, has a sweet and tangy plant fragrance, with an acidity of no more than 1%.
Extra virgin olive oil (Fine Virgin): slightly higher in acidity, but not more than 2%, pure in taste, aromatic.
Ordinary Virgin Olive Oil: delicious in taste and flavor, with an acidity of no more than 3.3%
Refined olive oil refers to olive oil obtained after refining primary olive oil to more than 3.3% acidity, or as a secondary oil.
Refined olive oil can be divided into two levels:
Common olive oil (Olive Oil): Refined olive oil mixed with a proportion of virgin olive oil to harmonize flavor and color, with an acidity of less than 1.5% and a transparent pale golden yellow.
Refined Olive-Pomace Oil is an olive oil obtained by solvent extraction and refining of olive-pomace oil.
You may have noticed that the acidity of olive oil is a very important indicator.
Remember, olives are like grapes pressed into wine, olives from different regions, different varieties of olives, produce different quality of oil.
The best places to grow olive oil:
The Mediterranean coast has the most suitable soil and climatic conditions, such as temperature, sunlight, air humidity and precipitation, required for the growth of oil olives.
Except for the Mediterranean coast, only sporadic cultivation is permitted in suitable habitats.
Main areas of production (Mediterranean):
Italy, Spain, Greece, Turkey, Portugal, Morocco, Syria, Israel, Tunisia, Algeria, Egypt, Pakistan, Lebanon, etc., have climates similar to those of Argentina, Peru, South Africa, etc., which are farther south in latitude.
Months in which olive oil is harvested:
Every year, from March to June, the oil olives bloom and bear fruit, and from July to October, the fruit begins to develop and mature, changing from green to red, purple, and finally black.
From November to February is the fruit harvesting season (but the freshness of the olive oil is very important).
The nutritional content of olive oil:
Olive oil is rich in monounsaturated fatty acids, namely oleic and sub-oleic acids, linoleic acid, as well as vitamin A, vitamin B, vitamin D, vitamin E, vitamin K and antioxidants.
Olive oil is considered to be the most nutritious oil ever discovered.
At the end of the Democracy Summit, Biden says the flame of freedom will never be extinguished
The Summit for Democracy, an online summit convened by US President Biden and attended by leaders of governments, civil society and the private sector from 110 countries around the world, ended on Friday (December 10).
In his closing remarks, Biden said that the fire of freedom burns in the hearts of everyone in the world, and that authoritarian regimes will never be able to extinguish it.
He also said that there are plans to hold the second Global Summit on Democracy next year.
Representatives of the Taiwanese government, State Councillor Tang Yi and Hong Kong's democracy and human rights activist Luo Chunsheng, who is currently in exile in the UK, also spoke at the summit on the second day.
Biden said: "Well, we know how hard the job is before us".
But we also know that we can rise to the challenge, because as I have said before, as this summit has shown, the democratic world is everywhere.
Authoritarian regimes will never be able to extinguish the flame of freedom that burns in the hearts and minds of people all over the world.
Biden also said that the defense of democracy requires the joint efforts of the whole society.
He said:  As leaders of the government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, to strengthen the shields of democracy, to promote reforms, to achieve transparent and accountable governance, to be more resistant to the buffers and shock forces of authoritarianism, and to those who want to pursue power nakedly before the public good.
On the second day of the Democracy Summit, the topics were defending human rights, consolidating democracy and countering authoritarianism, and countering digital authoritarianism and affirming democratic values.
The day coincides with International Human Rights Day.
In his opening remarks on the day, UN Secretary-General António Guterres also said that the cause of democracy faces challenges around the world, especially those posed by emerging digital technologies.
He said: "Now is the time to reaffirm the common values and positions and the resilience of democracy".
This requires deepening social dialogue, addressing inequality, fighting corruption, renewing the social contract, investing in quality education, and expanding opportunities for women and girls.
This also requires a firm condemnation of all forms of populism, nationalism and extremism, including the use of all the tools provided by the technological revolution.
Hong Kong's democracy and human rights activist Lo Chun-song addressed the summit via a pre-recorded video, reminding attendees of the ongoing human rights situation in Hong Kong and among China's minority ethnic groups such as Uighurs and Tibetans.
"For a long time, the world has been directly affected by the rise of China without establishing a mechanism to hold it accountable", he said.
This is why politicians and civil society leaders must work together.
We must use all the resources we have to ensure that the restoration of democracy is our first priority.
He also called on the free world to unite against the threat of the Chinese Communist Party.
"Maybe some of you are afraid of offending General Secretary Xi Jinping, maybe some of you don't want to lose the Chinese market, maybe some of you don't recognize the threat to our democratic values".
And that's why we failed.
That's why we have to change.
During a roundtable discussion on the fight against digital dictatorship and affirming the value of democracy, Taiwan's Executive Council Affairs Commissioner Tang Yi released a statement via video, emphasizing that Taiwan is at the forefront of the fight against tyranny and authoritarianism.
He also shared his experience of fighting the coronavirus pandemic through information transparency and building trust.
As Taiwan's democracy is on the rise, we are determined to be at the forefront of the global fight against authoritarianism and to play a leading role in promoting freedom, democracy and human rights globally.
During the pandemic, authoritarian governments around the world justified human rights violations in the name of public health and collective interests, and global democracy showed signs of backsliding.
However, in Taiwan, we can control the epidemic without shutting down the city, and we can defeat fake news without getting out of the way.
The U.S. Treasury Department announced legal sanctions on 15 individuals and 10 entities in several countries, including China and North Korea, for serious human rights violations, as well as investment restrictions on a Chinese company for allegedly using surveillance technology to facilitate human rights abuses.

I know.
But the restaurant doesn't know why it keeps delaying the delivery.
It turned out to be #NUMBER#
Then I won't call.
Don't eat it.
I will complain.
If you can't send it, why didn't you say so earlier?
I've waited so long for you.
No, I didn't get the call.

Hi, the mouthwash from the restaurant is genuine.
If you want to try tennis, but you're afraid you won't be able to stick to it, you'll want to find a similarly priced trainer first.
Unfriendly, in fact, the price tends to be proportional to the friendliness, and if you can't tell the difference, then the expensive ones will normally be friendlier than the cheap ones, which are actually industrial garbage.
They are very low in strength, the ball hits the beat, the vibration is very high, the hard top is not held, and it is difficult for the expert to handle.
The logic and the subtext of their existence is that playing tennis is so difficult, knowing that you won't learn it, and knowing that you can't afford to buy expensive, cheap stuff to confuse you, you play it twice, you won't play it again, so the beat is cheap, you don't feel bad.
So that you may be able to discern between good and evil, that your progress may be manifest. Then when you return, I will give you money back.
It is recommended to spend a similar price, buy a second-hand ball racket that is a little better, choose Prince or Pompe, these two brands are not well-known enough, so the good ball racket does not sell for a higher price, 500 or 600 new rackets are good, 200 second-hand ones, is it bad to have a thousand yuan racket?
They are friendly to newcomers, but after the newcomer stage, they become shy, but most people, especially girls, can't get past the newcomer stage.
The order has been delayed several times.
Can you please help follow up?
Delayed
Thank you.
I mean, do I actually have credit?
Do I need to re-order it? Does the original order no longer count?
Hi, I ordered food from this restaurant, but there was a lot of food missing, and the mouthwash was raw.
#PRS_ORG # No reason to ask me to take it, please cancel
My order was for delivery and I didn't take any responsibility for it.

In fact, there's a lot to be said for a girl who's underweight.
Fat girls shouldn't wear skirts that are too short or too long, they should be at least knee-length, just enough to cover the fat areas of the thighs.
A short neck reveals the fatness of the legs.
Too tall can make you feel short and fat.
If you wear it in the upper, middle and lower three sections, it will appear that you have grown naturally, that is, the upper body, elbows and long sleeves are painted in different colors, and it seems to create a sense of improvement.
In fact, a lot of dark-colored clothes are the norm for skinny girls (the author knows this well), dark colors are also a good way to hide your body fat, and elegant black shorts are the first choice for skinny girls.
Wearing dark-colored clothes, especially black shorts, can make you look thin.
If your calves are fat, don't wear trousers or shoes that attract too much attention.
The more popular the better, and the less colorful.
Don't make people feel fat when they pay attention to your legs and feet.
For girls who are slightly overweight, it's a must to talk about well-dressed and well-matched chicks.
Don't wear tight shorts, don't wear shorts that are too short, don't wear shorts that are too tight, don't wear shorts that are too tight, don't wear shorts that are too tight, don't wear shorts that are too tight, don't wear shorts that are too tight, don't wear shorts that are too tight, don't wear shorts that are too tight, don't wear shorts that are too tight, don't wear shorts that are too tight, don't wear shorts that are too tight, don't wear shorts that are too tight, don't wear shorts that are too tight, don't wear shorts that are too tight, don't wear shorts that are too tight, don't wear shorts that are too tight, don't wear shorts that are too tight, don't wear shorts that are too tight, don't wear shorts that are too tight, don't wear shorts that are too tight, don't wear shorts that are too tight, don't wear shorts that are too tight, don't wear shorts that are too tight, don't wear shorts that are too tight, don't wear shorts that are too tight, don't wear shorts that are too tight, don's too tight, don's too tight, don't wear shorts that's too tight, don's too tight, don's too tight, don's too tight, don's too tight, don's too tight, don's too tight, don's too tight
Of course, skinny girls should also wear shorts.
Fat girls who wear shorts should choose tops that match the color of the shorts, this will give you the effect of increasing the height of your fat body.
Shorts paired with high heels make your legs look longer, and this is the most IN pair of shorts in the summer!
If you are a fat but thin-legged MM, it is recommended that you choose dress shorts that are stylish.
It's not just about covering your belly, it's about showing your strengths.
A-shorts will be slim, more suitable for fat girls, and top dresses should be chosen to be more tight, forming a layered feeling of being slimmer.
Simple, plain white T-shirt with shorts, fat MM can also try.
I don't think it's a good idea for a girl to be thin, but it's also a good idea for a girl to be fashionable.
As long as they have mastered the rules of dress and fit, skinny girls will also be in the spotlight.
After a change in the way you dress, you should also exercise more in your life, and fight to get rid of the label of a thin and fat girl sooner.

Girl collects arrow for her sister: "It's good to think it's a skin wound"
A girl stands in front of a large wooden board in Hangzhou's Wulin Square, with the words "Hong Kong Meat Pork, Ten Yuan One Arrow" written on it.
Yesterday morning, a photo of a young girl in Hangzhou donating chickens to her sister went viral on social media.
The photo shows a girl standing in front of a slightly taller wooden board in Hangzhou's Wulin Square, with the words "Hungarian meat chopsticks" and "Ten yuan one arrow" written on the board, indicating that passers-by can use archery after paying.
The incident sparked outrage among netizens.
Last night, the head of the publicity department of the Lower City Branch of the Hangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau confirmed to Xinhua that the police confirmed that the girl had done such an exaggerated act to raise money for her sister, but this behavior was not to be encouraged, and the girl had left the local police station yesterday after being warned.
Girls in the streets are urged to raise money for arrowheads
In the viral image, a long-haired girl is standing in front of a large wooden board with black ink on which is written the name of a monkey, the name of a 10 yuan arrow, and her bank account number and WeChat, Alipay, etc. on the other board in front of her.
The picture sparked controversy after it was posted online.
Some netizens thought that this was a begging game of eyeballs, while others expressed sympathy.
This is what we found when we were patrolling the square at around 10 am on the 23rd, when the crowd had already gathered around the square.
In an interview with local media, police from the Tianyu police station near the scene said that there were two girls, both in their 20s, dressed in youthful outfits.
In one of them, a girl who plays the role of a monkey keeps crying, begging passersby to play the game; another girl is on the side helping the monkey drink, saying that her friend's sister has leukemia and now needs urgent surgery, please help.
We contacted the local police in Guizhou and learned that the girl was raising money for her sister's treatment for leukemia.
Last night, the head of publicity for the Lower City Branch of the Hangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau told Xinhua that the girl's name is Jijalie, and that she was collecting donations for her sister Jijalie.
But since the treatment still cost more than $300,000, I couldn't think of a good way to raise money, so I did it.
He said that during the whole process, two girls were killed, one was responsible for the shooting, but did not participate in it, no arrows were fired during the whole process, only someone looked around and took a photo and posted it on Weibo.
The archery used was not controlled by the police after it was identified by the security services.
The person in charge said that Liu did not advocate this kind of eyeball fundraising.
After being warned by the delegation, she left the delegation.

What's hot in 2021?
It's definitely the Olympics in Tokyo.
Do you think only gymnasts can win medals at the Olympics?
Project managers can hit gold medals at the Olympic Games, the article is very hot, it mentions that project managers can be the first on many projects, absolutely, no one can match: moving a car, going on business trips, staying overnight is the daily routine of project managers, firefighting, backpacking, apologizing is not even mentioned.
The article, which seems to be a joke, also reveals the daily bitterness of the project managers, which is represented by the lack of dedication to the current project management work.
And people who work in project management are gradually choosing to take some action to get themselves out of the predicament of their jobs.
Judging by the number of applicants for the PMP (International Certified Project Management Professional) which is rising every year, more and more project management practitioners are learning to improve their project management skills.
As of September 2019, the cumulative number of PMP® applicants in the country is nearly 600,000, the number of PMP® certified applicants is about 420,000, and the number of effective certificate holders is about 300,000, accounting for 31.2% of the total number of PMP® certificate holders worldwide.
Over the past 10 years, the number of PMP holders has increased year by year, indicating that more and more project managers are realizing that it is no longer advisable to do things simply by carrying on with the experience of the past, and the rapidly changing work environment tells us that we need to learn and stand on the shoulders of scientific giants to explore the way forward.
However, does the PMP guarantee the smooth running of the project?
Many project management beginners say that by studying related courses such as PMP / IPMP, they can systematically master the top ten areas of project management and the top five process groups, but it is still a fog when it comes to actually working in project management.
Many project managers often feedback on the following issues: lack of project management knowledge, relying solely on personal experience, empty project management theory, do not know how to practice; lack of systematic project management process system support, can not land in the work, project forecasts are not accurate, the control sensitivity is poor, the project is dragged back and forth; the division of labor of the members is unclear, the old oil barrier in the team does not know how to deal with the communication between departments is not smooth, the project is difficult to move forward...
Therefore, focusing on product innovation and R&D management for more than ten years, we have helped many excellent enterprises to train a large number of product managers, project managers and other key R&D talents, and received the honorary title of "China Enterprise R&D Manager Training Demonstration Base" and "China China Summer Consulting" with "R&D Project Manager Training Camp" online courses.

On the eve of the 22nd anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China (PRC), JCCI advocates rational consumption to consumers - Economic Observer Network - Professional Financial News Website
This year, the national online payment business transaction volume reached 1.77 trillion yuan, which is more innovative than in previous years.
Once again, consumers have benefited from the abundance of red-packed, eye-catching, and live-streamed merchandise, which on the one hand makes people lament the growing strength of national consumption, but on the other hand, it is necessary to calm down and think about the impact of consumerism on society and contemporary mainstream consumer groups.
On the eve of the arrival of the 12th Anniversary, JCFC Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as JCFC Ltd.) issued a rational consumption advocacy, reminding the general public, especially young people, to establish good consumer awareness and consumption habits, and to reject blind consumption and excessive consumption.
According to the People's Bank of China's Consumer Financial Literacy Survey Analysis Report released this year, the country's Consumer Financial Literacy Index stands at 66.81, an increase of 2.04 compared to 2019.
Overall, Chinese residents are performing well in terms of financial consumption, but there are significant differences in different aspects of financial behavior and skills, and there is a need to further improve the level of basic financial knowledge.
The financial literacy level of the elderly and young people is relatively low, and the elderly and young people will continue to be the focus of financial education; the report on the debt situation of China's young people released by Nielsen and the 2019-2020 China Youth Consumption Report released by CCTV Finance show that the young generation has a huge consumption potential, and credit consumption has become an important way to upgrade consumption. 86.6% of young people are using credit products, and nearly half of them do not have debt accumulation.
As a licensed consumer financial institution, Jetsin has been committed to helping people build their own happy lives with quality and attentive services, advocating for consumers to establish a good and correct consumer attitude, and actively responding to regulatory calls to promote rational consumer awareness, especially among young people, through practical actions.
Over the past several years, JSC has been conducting comprehensive and diversified financial awareness campaigns for young people, including university students, and by cooperating with the country's top universities to launch innovative practice competitions and other forms of subtle silencing of the consumption needs of young people, to help them establish rational consumption concepts, rationally plan consumption needs, and thus accumulate wealth for their life.
On the occasion of the arrival of Gemini 12, JSC reminds all consumer friends to establish reasonable consumer awareness and the right view of money, resist blind consumption and excessive consumption, avoid consumer borrowing mistakes, so as not to affect personal credit and future economic life.
It's important to plan your spending in advance and pay it off on time.
If overdue, the overdue record will be recorded in the personal credit report, which may have a negative impact on the future financial life such as buying a car, buying a house.
At the same time, when enjoying financial products and services, one should also choose formal institutions and channels, and pay attention to checking whether the relevant institutions are qualified to operate.
With its mature and reliable consumer finance system and continuously updated financial products, JSC will continue to bring more tailored and diversified services to consumers, continuously help the public to improve the level of financial knowledge, help consumers cultivate the concept of rational consumption and moderate borrowing, and be a reliable consumer finance partner for consumers for life.

Vietnam People's Daily - The Gulf Cooperation Council responds to common challenges
Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's stops include Oman, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, Bahrain and Kuwait.
Notably, this is the first visit by Crown Prince Mohammed to Qatar since Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies imposed an embargo on Qatar in mid-2017 that led to the Gulf diplomatic crisis.
In the midst of the crisis, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt severed diplomatic relations with Qatar and imposed a total embargo on the country, accusing it of supporting terrorist groups and maintaining close ties with Iran.
The diplomatic tensions have severely affected the internal unity of the Hague Conference and have had a negative impact on the economies of the countries in the region.
Four Arab countries have blocked land, sea and air routes to Qatar.
The crisis was only resolved at the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) summit in January 2021, when the Gulf states signed an agreement brokered by the United States and Kuwait to move toward greater solidarity and stability.
Saudi Arabia has reopened its border with Qatar.
Saudi Arabia and Egypt are spearheading efforts to restore relations with Qatar through the appointment of new ambassadors in Qatar.
The Gulf Arab States resolve their differences in order to restore relations with Qatar, a requirement that stems from the need to unite for the interests of the countries and regional stability, with the aim of addressing common challenges.
During the visit of the Saudi Crown Prince to Oman, the two sides agreed to open the first direct land corridor between the two Gulf neighbors.
The 725-kilometer corridor connecting the two countries will facilitate travel and supply chain integration for citizens of both countries.
Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) is investing $5 billion in Oman, and the two companies have signed 13 memorandums of understanding (MoUs) for cooperation worth $30 billion.
The Saudi Crown Prince's visit to the Gulf coincides with Iran's negotiations with world powers to save the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), an agreement condemned by a Gulf Arab state for failing to resolve its missile problem with Iran.
The Gulf states have long viewed Iran as a long-term rival and its nuclear program as a major threat to regional security.
The Gulf states consider it flawed not to address the Iranian missile issue and not to take action to curb Iran's activities in the region.
In the context of the failure of the major powers to meet the aspirations of the Gulf states in the nuclear negotiations with Iran, Saudi Arabia held direct talks with Iran.
The aim is to contain the escalation of tensions in the region.
This is one of the factors slowing down economic growth in the GCC countries.
The upcoming GCC summit will be the first GCC summit since the end of the dispute between some member states and Qatar.
This is an opportunity for the Gulf Cooperation Council to reassess the diplomatic achievements that have contributed to promoting the restoration of Gulf unity, while proposing measures to enable its Member States to cooperate fully in order to address common challenges and contribute to the stability and development of the Gulf States.

That's good.
It's called the New Mountains Extreme Run, and it's the loudest!
The car that our team has brought to you this time is the dream of many men!
It is Lamborghini's flagship supercar, the replacement for the Murcielago, the Aventador LP700-4!
Why is it called LP700 if it costs almost two million horsepower, the road tax is tens of thousands of horsepower a year, and it has four-wheel drive?
Can you imagine how fast it is because it has 700 horsepower?
I don't know, the data says it takes only 2.9 seconds to accelerate from 0 to 100 km/h, it's probably myvi's myvi to reach 30 km/h by the time people reach 100 km/h.
The low-slung body, the sweeping scissor doors, the huge air intakes all around the body and the 6.5 v12 engine with a glass back, perfectly convey the style of the Lamborghini.
There's not much to say about the description of the car, just Google it yourself, and I've compiled some of the explanations that Google doesn't necessarily give!
It's too much of a publicity stunt, it's embarrassing wherever you go, it's kind of cool.
Fuel costs around RM1 per km (owners don't care at all)
Practice getting in and out of the car, otherwise it will be a bit awkward (because you won't be able to climb out of the car and you'll be stuck halfway)
The engine is so loud, I'll be deaf when I get out of the car.
It's too big, it's too narrow to park in a normal parking lot, it's too scary to be knocked out by a neighbor's car when it opens the door!
It's a bit lonely because there are no rivals on the road (that's what he said, nothing to do with the owner, haha)
Don't get me wrong, this video is not for sale, sorry!
Friends who want to make a video for your car are welcome to contact us!
For more information on cars you didn't know about, see The Car Guide / People's Automotive Initiative
This is the first time that a car has been involved in an accident worth tens of millions of rupees!
The Bugatti Chiron is one of the most expensive supercars in the world, and the Porsche 911 is worth millions!
The day before that, a million 911 sports cars and tens of millions of Chiron supercars were crushed in just a few minutes abroad!

Let the spirit of the university resonate with the spirit of the times - Xinhua Network
The university spirit refers to a set of operating philosophies and value pursuits that a university has accumulated over a long period of time during its development. It is the soul of the university.
Throughout history, the university spirit has been essential for political, economic, cultural, technological and social development, as well as for the progress of a nation.
From the birth of the world's first university in the modern sense, the university shoulders a unique mission different from other social organizations. For our universities, rising in the autumn of national crisis, its spirit is more deeply influenced by traditional culture and the changes of the times, advocating the values of Liu Mingzhi, Zhizhi Ping'an's philosophy and the patriotism of the Qing Dynasty.
At present, the trend of informatization and internationalization of higher education is increasingly evident, the global educational competition, technological competition and talent competition are increasing, the cause of higher education as an important supply side, its structural reform is facing unprecedented opportunities and challenges.
In particular, Xi Jinping's overall plan to promote world-class universities and first-class disciplines, while demonstrating the confidence and determination of our country to move from a major country in higher education to a major country in higher education, has put forward even higher and more updated requirements for the development of universities.
How can we work to become one of the world's leading universities in a shorter period of time, accelerate the construction of several world-class universities and a number of world-class disciplines on the basis that there is still a gap, and achieve tunnel overpass?
In addition to the firm goal of self-confidence, self-confidence in the path and self-confidence in the ability, universities should make full use of three advantages: first, the advantages of backwardness, through the continuous introduction of outstanding academic talents from abroad, learning from the advanced experience of the world's top universities, to achieve significant improvement in academic level and quality of teaching; second, the advantages of culture, inheriting the wisdom of Chinese civilization accumulated in five thousand years, promoting the development of excellent traditional culture, thus consolidating strength, shaping brands and improving the image; and third, the advantages of the system, using the superiority of the socialist country's system, strengthening the goal drive, pooling consensus, optimizing the allocation of resources, and providing a sustainable solid guarantee for schools to accelerate the world's advanced level.
In particular, it is important to realize that it is not possible to build a world-class university in a thousand schools, and each school must demonstrate its own personality and characteristics while exerting its strengths.
The characteristics of the schools should have a common Chinese character, but also reflect their unique goal orientation, school tradition and resource endowment.
As for Zhejiang University, we focus on highlighting three aspects of the school: one is to highlight the characteristics of developing innovative entrepreneurial talents, building an integrated fostering environment for interdisciplinary integration and school-business integration, and forming a full-chain entrepreneurial education ecosystem; two is to highlight the characteristics of cross-disciplinary meetings, promoting the optimization of the discipline system, creating an institutional environment for cross-disciplinary integration, actively cultivating cross-emerging disciplines and iconic cross-disciplinary outcomes; and three is to highlight the characteristics of the school system and social service, carrying out in-depth international exchange cooperation, and accelerating the formation of a pan-industry research and development cooperation system.
In this process, it is especially important to always stick to the spirit of the university, so that the spirit of the university resonates with the spirit of the times.
For Zhejiang University, yoga is the newest expression of the spirit of yoga, which is based on the common values of innovative yoga training, yoga practice, meditation, discernment and practice, as well as the common values of the Yangtze River, the Yangtze River, the Yangtze River, the Yangtze River, the Yangtze River, the Yangtze River, the Yangtze River, the Yangtze River, the Yangtze River, the Yangtze River, the Yangtze River, the Yangtze River, the Yangtze River, the Yangtze River, the Yangtze River, the Yangtze River, the Yangtze River, the Yangtze River, the Yangtze River, the Yangtze River, the Yangtze River, the Yangtze River, the Yangtze River, the Yangtze River, the Yangtze River, the Yangtze River, the Yangtze River, the Yangtze River, the Yangtze River, the Yangtze River, the Yangtze River, the Yangtze River, the Yangtze River, and the Yangtze River.
This is an important guarantee of the school's adherence to the correct direction of schooling, continuous accumulation of cultural heights, and consolidation of spiritual strength, rich in meaning, and profound in meaning.
Among them, Yang Haizhi emphasized the spirit of openness and inclusiveness, embodying the ideal of excellence of students who use their brains for what they do with the genius of the world; Yang Keqiang emphasized the spirit of seeking truth and goodness, referring to the university in the pursuit of truth, while more appropriately embracing the ceramics and personality of the university; Yang Keqiang emphasized the spirit of reform and innovation, which includes both the pursuit of knowledge and the innovation of scientific research, and also represents the reform and development of the revolution; Yang Jianguo emphasized the spirit of patriotism, and spoke about the fact that universities should always be associated with the fate and glory of the nation.
This series of spiritual philosophies and pursuit of values is the soul of Zhejiang University's 120 years of existence.
The deaf hear the silence, the sighted see the unseen.
Chinese universities should further build on the overall socialist cause with Chinese characteristics, deeply grasp the direction of the times and the historical mission of higher education, and accelerate the construction of world-class universities.
At the same time, adhering to humanistic care and independent freedom, let the spirit of the university and the spirit of the times and the spirit of the nation vibrate with each other, thus providing inexhaustible impetus for the realization of national wealth and national revival, and the realization of the common ideal of mankind.

A new concept has emerged in the crypto community in the midst of the NFT craze.
In 2021, a blockchain game called Axie Infinity made a huge impact in Southeast Asia, with some residents who lost their jobs due to the pandemic starting to earn a steady income from the game.
Axie Infinity is a blockchain-based pet-rearing game that brings together a variety of games including NFTs, and is the highest-grossing NFT project to date, with over US$3 billion in sales.
According to TokenTerminal, Axie Infinity earns more than $8.2 million per day, which is close to the King's glory.
On August 6th, Axie Infinity officially announced that it had over 1 million daily active users.
The excitement of Axie Infinity brings a new kind of gameplay mode to more people, where the player is no longer a single character with the help of blockchain and smart contracts, but can also participate in the governance of the game ecosystem in addition to enjoying and gaining economic benefits from the game.
This sovereignty is not granted by the game maker, but guaranteed by blockchain technology.
Seeing the news about the share price of a friend, my biggest impression is the choice of enterprises in the racetrack, that is, the choice of industries for investment targets, first of all, to choose a large growth area, at least more than 100 billion market size; second, to choose a good growth industry in the future, consider the industry in the next 3-5 years after the growth of the industry to reach the best state of the industry; and finally, to choose a policy-supported industry.
Whether the track is wide refers to the size of the market, whether the track is long refers to the stage of development of the industry, and whether the track is flat or rough refers to the competitive pattern of the industry.
Fuel for the right track!
In the new year, the first thing to do is to summarize 2021 and adjust the 2022 tactical layout.
The tactic is to do the things right.
Strategy is about doing the right thing.
Strategy is about finding directions, tactics is about landing, and in most tactical thinking, there is room for strategic thinking.
For example, how to increase the number of customers (tactical thinking), you can think about continuous deepening or horizontal extension in the current field (strategic thinking); for example, improving customer retention rate (tactical thinking), you can think about how to improve the retention rate of core customers and high-value customers (strategic thinking); for improving activity engagement (tactical thinking), you can think about how to set the right activity KPIs to achieve the right activity goals, such as improving the engagement of target customers, activating high-value silences, accurately introducing new ones; for improving DAU (tactical thinking), you can think about whether the current growth is sustainable and healthy.
In its 12th year, Bitcoin has witnessed several milestones in 2021.
On September 7, El Salvador, a small country in Central America, recognized bitcoin as its legal tender, marking the first time that bitcoin has become legal tender in a country or region.
On October 12, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved ProShares for the first time in eight years to launch a bitcoin ETF and list it on the New York Stock Exchange, marking the first compliant bitcoin futures ETF to land on U.S. capital markets and further expanding the cryptocurrency investment window.
From the perspective of the development of blockchain technology, Bitcoin is not the protagonist.
On November 14, 2021, Bitcoin underwent a soft fork upgrade called the Taproot upgrade, which improves the anonymity of Bitcoin network transactions and reduces the data burden in transactions by changing the data structure of the block itself.

After seeing my wedding photo, I realized that I was a fake too.
Asian-American groups complain of discrimination in admissions at Yale and other Ivy League universities
More than 130 Asian-American groups filed complaints with the U.S. Department of Education and the U.S. Department of Justice on May 23 to protest discrimination against Asian-American applicants in the admissions process at three Ivy League schools: Yale University, Brown University, and Dartmouth College.
The Asian Educational Alliance, which initiated the complaint, held a press conference in Washington on the same day.
At the press conference, the group's chairman, Liu Yucang, said that the number of Asian applicants eligible for admission to prestigious American universities has increased exponentially over the past 10 years, but the percentage of Asian applicants at the three prestigious American universities has remained essentially the same.
A number of studies have shown that these universities persistently and systematically discriminate against Asian applicants in the so-called "comprehensive" admissions process.
A 2014 study by scholars such as Sanders found that Asian students had the lowest acceptance rate of any ethnic group among the three universities in terms of the number of applicants.
Data from the U.S. Department of Education also shows that of all Ivy League schools, Brown University and Dartmouth College have the lowest admissions rates for Asian-American students, and Yale and Brown have implemented de facto racial quotas for Asian-American applicants for more than 20 years.
Liu told Xinhua that they hope that after the complaint is filed, the U.S. Department of Education and the U.S. Department of Justice will be able to investigate and take action to stop the universities from continuing to discriminate against Asian-Americans in admissions.
They also hope that the universities complained about will take the initiative to address the issue and change their admissions policies for Asian students.
At the moment, the three universities that were the subject of the complaint have not responded.
The Alliance for Asian American Education was founded in 2015 after a complaint about discrimination in admissions to Harvard University was rejected by the U.S. Department of Education for procedural reasons.
In addition to Chinese-American groups, the complaint includes Indian-American, Korean-American, Japanese-American, and Pakistani-American educational groups.
I need dishes.
I just canceled my order.

In September 2020, Mr. Lu learned from a housing broker about a factory in Zhejiang's Yuexiang Township, and after several on-site visits, Mr. Lu decided to purchase the factory.
In December of the same year, after Mr. Lu had discussed the details of the purchase with the family of the owner of the house, Mr. Lin, he made a payment of 200,000 yuan via bank transfer on the same day.
Lin signed as the receiver on the receipt box for the sale of the factory, which stated that if the buyer did not want to buy the factory, the deposit would be returned to the seller, if the seller did not want to sell the factory, the deposit would be returned twice to the seller, and the parties agreed to sign the contract for the sale of the factory within a week.
However, the two sides later failed to reach an agreement on the main terms of the contract, such as the scope of the sale of the factory premises and the method of payment, resulting in delays in the signing of the contract for the sale of the house.
Considering that the two sides could not agree on the content of the contract, a few days later, Lin returned the 200,000 yuan deposit to Mr. Lu.
The house is not easy to see, the money has been paid, the house is ready, the contract is about to be signed at the door, but the seller does not sell, which makes Mr. Lu frustrated and angry.
For this reason, Mr. Lu has filed a lawsuit against Ms. Lin to the People's Court of Yueyang City.
The court held that the failure of the parties to conclude a formal contract, which cannot be attributed solely to the defendant, should be reasonably presumed to be non-negotiable, and therefore the fine should not be applied in this case, and the defendant does not have to assume the liability for the violation of the double refund of the fine.
After the verdict, the plaintiffs filed an appeal.
Recently, the Court of Appeals upheld the original verdict.
Liu's lawyers reminded Liu to exercise due diligence during the transaction.
At the same time as signing the contract, the buyer must take the necessary due diligence, such as verifying the information of the owner of the house, whether the house is occupied, and other relevant information, and specify in the contract the specific time and place of delivery, in order to avoid disputes between the parties in the performance of the contract at the same time.
Speaking after the end of the "Democracy Summit" on Friday, China's Foreign Ministry spokesman said on Saturday (December 11) that the United States hosted the "Democracy Summit of Leaders" to "ideologically delineate, instrumentalize and weaponize democracy, act against the reality of democracy in the name of pseudo-democracy, foment divisive confrontations, and shift internal conflicts".
The Chinese government believes that "for a long time, the United States has imposed its own political system and values on people, implemented 'democratic reforms', abused unilateral sanctions, and orchestrated 'color revolutions' with disastrous consequences".
'Democracy' has long been a 'weapon of mass destruction' for US interference in other countries.
The summit is Biden's way of fulfilling his campaign promises.
The two-day conference was held via video link, and leaders from 111 countries around the world were invited to attend, including the leaders of Taiwan, but China and Russia were not invited.
On the eve of the summit, China and Russia criticized the United States for the emergence of democracy in the United States, saying that the United States is not qualified to host such a summit.
There are also skeptical voices internationally and within the United States, such as those who criticize the fact that some of the leaders invited to the summit include those with authoritarian tendencies, such as the leaders of the Philippines, Poland and Brazil, and those who doubt that the real intention of the Biden administration is to organize the summit not for democracy but for geopolitical purposes.
Newly appointed German Chancellor Schultz participates in video democracy summit
China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement on Saturday that "today's American democracy is sick, with money politics, identity politics, party rivalries, political polarization, social rifts, ethnic conflicts, and the division between rich and poor becoming more acute", and that democracy in the United States is a "rich man's game" based on capital.
In his speech, U.S. President Biden said, "As leaders of government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, to strengthen the shields of democracy, to push for reforms, to achieve transparent and accountable governance, to be more resilient to the buffers and shock waves of authoritarianism, and to those who want to pursue power nakedly before the public good".
He stressed that democracy is not something that can be taken for granted, "we have to keep renewing it in every generation, and in my opinion this is the decisive challenge of our time".
Biden also said that global democracy and human rights "need fighters to defend them in the face of continuing and worrisome challenges".
The United States pledged to launch a year-long campaign, including a $424.4 million initiative, following the Democracy Summit to strengthen democracy around the world and support independent news media.
The United States expects countries to make concrete public commitments to improve their democratic institutions before the Summit on Real Democracy, scheduled for late 2022.
"Let's make sure that all of our countries live up to our commitments and report back next year on the progress we've made", Biden said.
Well, I'm afraid he sent the wrong address.
Japanese restaurant (五道口店)
[Menthol] Environment: The rules and regulations [service kit] Service: The dishes are served very quickly. "Gua Fa Mara Cake" is my must-have dish. The pasta is too sweet and soft to eat. 😋 The little ones who like desserts must try the "Tong Jiang Mishi Smooth Tofu Soup". The soup is very delicious. The tofu is very soft.
The taste is good, the meat is good, the service is enthusiastic.
It's been a long time since I've had a sunny day, but the fruit is still so good to eat and the real ingredients are enough, and the first time I had a bagel, it was the southern flavor of my favorite loose flour!
Chicken rice is well dried and moistened, the portion is very adequate, the signboard tin wings are as good as ever, the usual cooking is also good, the curry is also better...
The taste is good, the service is enthusiastic, the meat is good.
The old Japanese store, which was also a red-light district many years ago, has a small building on the east side, with wooden floors.
There is always a long wait at the door to eat the chicken rice, and the chicken rice sandwiches are cracked...
After years of not eating sunflowers, the rise of snack shops has been a distraction.

What are the rules for drinking red card whiskey?
Red Scotch is one of the best-selling Scotch whiskies in the world and has won the Gold Medal at the International Wine & Spirit Competition.
Each bottle of red whisky has a unique flavor, but if you don't know how to taste it, you're spoiling it.
So what about red card whiskey?
This is a brief introduction to the story.
How to drink red card whiskey:
Johnnie's Red Certified Scotch Whisky is a blend of approximately 35 different Scotch whiskies, with a rich aroma and characteristics of traditional Scotch whiskies, with a sweet and tobacco-flavored aroma.
Fresh imported vodka with a hint of vanilla and a pungent tobacco malt flavor.
The wine can be drunk directly on ice, or mixed with your favorite beverage.
Red Scotch entered the country, and in order to adapt to the tastes of the people of the country, Red Scotch + Coke or bubble drinks such as cider or whisky became a lasting fashion.
These sweet drinks, in addition to being moderate and sour, are visually pleasing, added to drinks, and have the effect of altering the taste of distilled spirits.
Red Scotch whisky + sliced onions + brown sugar (or sugar) is the most authentic and traditional way to drink it.
Authentic red wine tastes somewhat sour, adding sugar can moderate the sour flavor, and vinegar will give the wine a fresh flavor, of course, the sweetness can be adjusted according to personal taste.
The above three are the best ways to drink red card whiskey, which you can try as a reference, hopefully the introduction in this article will help you.
Educational Thinking: How college exams can make the uneducated uneducated uneducated uneducated uneducated uneducated uneducated uneducated uneducated uneducated uneducated uneducated uneducated uneducated uneducated uneducated uneducated uneducated uneducated uneducated uneducated uneducated uneducated uneducated uneducated uneducated uneducated uneducated uneducated uneducated uneducated uneducated uneducated uneducated uneducated uneducated uneducated uneducated uneducated uneducated uneducated uneducated uneducated uned
Three students from Lanzhou Transportation University wrote to the school's leadership, expressing their confusion about the university exams, and requesting to increase the difficulty of the exams and change the type of exam so that the exams truly reflect the students' actual level.
Indeed, for a long time, university exams have been a hot topic.
On the university campus, students come from all over the world, with varying levels of ability, as well as varying degrees of study and circumstances.
For a group with such diverse characteristics to be evaluated, there are different feelings, which are unavoidable.
Of course, if the test is single, repetitive, and too simple, it will inevitably cause a completely different feeling.
Students who don't do their homework may qualify with a focused attack before the exam, and if they think of other ways, they may be able to achieve half the effect of their homework.
So, as soon as there is a dropout, the student who usually does not participate can also pass, and even get a high score; the student who usually never misses class, the homework and notes are good, and the exam is not much higher than the strange situation.
In this way, it is not without reason that students at Lanzhou University reflect on the problems that exist in university exams, and it is believed that this situation is not unique to Lanzhou University.
In this sense, congratulations to the three students who wrote directly to Chen.
In fact, people who have gone to university know that it is not uncommon to attack the exam, try to find all sorts of ways to steal the exam from the teacher, try to get the scope of the exam, try to get the key guidance before the exam, even carrying small scripts in the exam, asking the teacher to raise their hands after the exam is not surprising.
In the author's opinion, as a guideline for evaluating the quality of teaching, the measure of success in a university examination is more about the teachers' comprehensive grasp of teaching and learning, and the scientific propositions based on this.
When you enter the undergraduate level of university, the majors start to be subdivided, and many of the majors are based on basic knowledge.
There is no doubt that the basic knowledge of a subject is the subject of the university examination.
While undergraduate knowledge is basically the basic theory of the subject and basic common sense, from the point of view of knowledge, there is not much room for change, it is basically fixed.
As one of my teachers said, I learned the basics of mathematics in college 20 years ago, and I'm still learning and focusing on it now.
However, the knowledge points are basically the same, which does not mean that the type of test is single, and the test is repeated.
In many universities, the examination is usually organized into groups of topics, and then the examination papers are compiled by the senior teachers of the subject, and the examination papers are also participated by all the teachers of the subject, so that the repetition of the examination papers can be overcome to a certain extent.
However, in order to formulate a set of tests that are in line with the teaching and learning practice, the questions are distributed according to the overall situation of student learning, difficulty is normal, and it is also necessary to comprehensively master the teaching situation, comprehensively analyze the degree of student learning, so that the exam questions have a dynamic grasp of difficulty and topic, can both highlight the examination of basic knowledge, and can take into account the examination of ability, and at the same time innovate the design of the topic.
Examination is the steering wheel of university education, what kind of examination, students will have a corresponding preparation program, in the long run, will affect the success of university education.
Changes to the program have been implemented at all Lanzhou Inter-University Schools, where students' letters of recommendation are highly valued.
Require all teaching units to organize teachers to conduct workshops and self-examinations at the end of the curriculum, develop exam test papers and related systems, and strengthen the supervision and inspection of exam papers and review elements, fine-tune the evaluation of results, and strengthen the comprehensive examination of all aspects of the curriculum teaching.
From the mechanism to solve the problem of the type of single test, the repetition of the subject is the issue that the university examination needs to face, of course, the corresponding system needs to be introduced, but the effort is expensive in everyday life, the teacher needs to have a comprehensive grasp of the teaching situation, not only to eat through the teaching content, but also to eat through the student learning situation, both eat through, teaching and teaching will be better aligned, form a positive interaction, the exam will also be more practical, so that the dropout and the dropout get their due.

Lady Kim's wedding photography (South Street store) There are no stores yet
Before the photo shoot, we had to change the time twice because we didn't have an appointment, and consultant Lan Lan was patient enough to arrange the time for us.
The photo was taken on a weekend when the weather was nice.
Kim's staff, whether consultants, makeup artists, or photographers, are incredibly talented.
It was the first time in my life that I officially wore makeup, and I couldn't believe that one day I would look that good, haha.
Xiao Jie and another sister (sorry I can't remember the name) are super patient and make-up is natural.
The exteriors were taken in the city of Yangtze Bay, fortunately the weather was good that day, and we didn't feel very cold, and when the photos were taken, the make-up artist occasionally noticed our clothes, hairstyles, and if something was a little off, he immediately helped us clean it up.
The photographer was also very humorous and had a great time capturing the day.
When choosing the photos, because there are many cases on the Internet, we don't want to have the guests delete too many photos, but when we chose the photos, really, we didn't mean to add photos at all, there were 24 photos in the package, not one was added ((I heard that my cousin and I spent almost the same amount of time taking wedding photos, there were more than 7,000 packages and more than 10,000 photos, at that time I was stunned, and I was afraid that I would choose too many))
Today the photo was fixed, Lan Lan sent it to me, and I saw two that were not so good, and they immediately helped me fix it.
Looking back at my sister's previous photos, I think I'm really satisfied with our photo, it's simple and fresh, it's the style I want.
I highly recommend you all to go and take a wedding photo of Ms. Chan Hanking!
The price is $3999.
Mrs. Kim, thank you very much. I sincerely wish you happiness and prosperity.
How much is this set?
What are the conditions for that $32 to be used?
That's all right, no refunds.
Your rider said he couldn't find it.
Not found

3,200 newborn babies in Sabah without birth certificates
Since the beginning of October, the National Registry of Sabah has been unable to issue birth certificates to newborn babies due to the availability of special anti-counterfeiting paper, which has affected 3,200 people so far, according to the National Registry of Sabah.
However, the director of the office, Keru Aminus, assures that all the babies who have applied for birth certificates have been recorded in the system and will be sent back when the anti-counterfeiting certificates arrive next week.
At the press conference, he explained that the online media had been reporting on the problems of printing the Sabah newspaper for 10 months.
He said that the issue was raised two months ago and that Sarawak is facing the same problem.
One of the reasons for this is that Chinese manufacturers who produce specially made anti-counterfeiting paper are affected by the epidemic, causing delays in shipments to our country.
He explained that the anti-counterfeiting paper used in Sabah is different from that used in other parts of the country and therefore cannot be borrowed from other provinces.
The latest batch of anti-counterfeiting paper arrived in Kuala Lumpur on the 6th of this month and was handed over to the printing company on the 8th for partial printing.
The agency will send people to Kuala Lumpur next Thursday to pick up the goods and return to Sabah immediately for the final stage of printing, which is estimated to take another 2 working days (December 20) to be delivered to the applicant.
We will notify applicants to go to the local branch to collect their application papers.
He added that Saba has issued 24,801 birth certificates so far this year.
From 7 p.m. until now
Is that coming soon?
I mean food.
I'm on the other side of #PRS_ORG
Well, thank you, because the restaurant says it's ready.
People's Daily commentator: The 14th Five-Year Plan is off to a good start
Xinhua Beijing, December 11 People's Daily, December 12 Commentator's article: The 14th Five-Year Plan is off to a good start
The Central Economic Work Conference held from December 8 to 10 highly evaluated the achievements of China's economic and social development over the past year.
General Secretary Xi Jinping delivered an important speech at the meeting, deeply summarizing the economic work of 2021, deeply analyzing the current economic situation, making a major deployment of the economic work of 2022, for us to do the economic work of next year, to welcome the twentieth victory of the party, pointing out the direction to go forward, and providing the fundamental follow-up.
We solemnly celebrate the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China, and officially announce the comprehensive building of a well-off society, the achievement of the first 100 years of the goal of struggle, the launch of the comprehensive construction of a socialist modern state, and the new march towards the second 100 years of the goal of struggle.
We have convened the Sixth Plenary Session of the Nineteenth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to summarize the major achievements and historical experience of the Party's centennial struggle, and have adopted the third historical resolution of the CPC Central Committee on the major achievements and historical experience of the Party's centennial struggle. This is the political declaration of the Communist Party of China in the new era to remember its initial mission, uphold and develop socialism with Chinese characteristics, and guide its actions to study history, create the future and achieve the great revival of the Chinese nation.
In a year of unprecedented changes in the world and the impact of the global pandemic of novel coronavirus pneumonia, the external environment has become more complex and severe, and the task of preventing and controlling the epidemic of novel coronavirus pneumonia and economic and social development in the country is extremely difficult.
The Party Central, with Comrade Xi Jinping as its core, has insisted on unifying the two major domestic and international events, adhering to the overall tone of steady and progressive work, focusing on responding to the change of the century and the epidemic of the century, unifying epidemic prevention and control and economic and social development, accelerating the construction of a new development pattern, strengthening macro-policy cross-cycle regulation, striving to promote sustainable and healthy economic development, focusing on deepening reform and opening up innovation, striving to complete the difficult task of reform and development, and the Party and various national affairs have achieved new major achievements.
An important aspect of the good start of the 14th Five-Year Plan is the new pace of building a new pattern of development and achieving new results in high-quality development.
China's economic development and epidemic prevention and control maintained its leading position in the world, and its resilience, high potential and dynamic characteristics continued to be manifested; the country's strategic technological strength accelerated, major innovation achievements emerged, and its technological innovation capacity continued to improve, and key core technology breakthroughs were achieved; the industrial chain resilience was improved, the quality of foreign trade increased, and the structure continued to be optimized, and the new dynamic power represented by the new industrial and industrial model grew; reform and opening-up profoundly advanced, focused on reducing the need for adaptation of supply and movement of elements, and creating new competitive advantages in cooperation with high levels of opening-up; people's livelihoods were effectively guaranteed, the scale of employment continued to expand, and the income of residents grew in line with the basic growth of the economy, and food security was maintained at more than 713 million tons of food all year long.
These achievements are the result of the strong leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core, the result of Xi Jinping's scientific guidance of socialist thought in the new era of China, and the result of the perseverance and hard struggle of the people of all ethnic groups throughout the Party.
Practice has once again proved that the Party has established the central position of Comrade Xi Jinping's Party Central Committee and the central position of the Party as a whole, and has established the guiding position of Xi Jinping's socialist ideas with Chinese characteristics in the new era, which is of decisive significance for the development of the party and the national cause in the new era and for advancing the historical process of the great revival of the Chinese nation.
With General Secretary Xi Jinping as the core of the Party Central Committee and the central leadership of the Party as a whole, with Xi Jinping's socialist ideological and scientific guidance for the new era of Chinese characteristics, and with the unity and perseverance of the people of all ethnic groups throughout the Party, we will surely be able to overcome all kinds of difficulties and obstacles, create a new era and embark on a new great historical career in the new journey of comprehensive construction of a socialist modern state.
The twentieth congress of the party, which will be held next year, is an important event in the political life of the party and the country.
By upholding the great spirit of the Party, adhering to the general principle of working for stability and progress, fully and accurately implementing the new development concept, accelerating the construction of a new development pattern, comprehensively deepening reform and opening up, adhering to innovation-driven development, promoting high-quality development, adhering to supply-side structural reforms as the main line, coordinating epidemic prevention and control and economic and social development, coordinating development and security, continuing to do good work to maintain stability, improving people's livelihoods, focusing on stabilizing the macroeconomic landscape, maintaining economic operations in reasonable districts, maintaining social stability, we will surely be able to maintain a stable and healthy economic environment, a safe social environment for Thai people, and a clean political environment to welcome the 20th victory celebration of the Party with excellent results.
Let us unite more closely around the Party Central with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core, strengthen the four pillars of consciousness, firmly uphold the four pillars of self-confidence, and achieve the two pillars of maintenance, constantly improve political judgment, political awareness, and political execution, and implement the Party Central decision-making in practical actions, and continuously advance the cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era.

Education: Beijing squeezes the growth rate of special education students enrolled in secondary schools in early 2016 - Xinhua News Agency
On the 21st and 22nd, the special entrance examination for junior high school students in Beijing was organized by the Unified Organization of Teaching Committees in all districts.
This year, all districts in Beijing have reduced the number of special education students enrolled, and the competition for special education students has become more intense.
For example, in the Eastern Townships, this year, the percentage of students enrolled in primary and secondary schools in the district does not exceed 5% of the total number of students enrolled in the district. The number of students enrolled in the district is 380, and the proportion of students enrolled in schools does not exceed 10% of the total number of students enrolled in the school.
Students with sports, arts, and technology specialties who register online are eligible to take the special student entrance exam.
In order to make it easier for students to take the exam in close proximity, the East City District has continued the arrangement of last year's examination by setting up 1 to 2 examination locations in each school district, for a total of 13 examination locations.
Examinations are divided into examination zones, divided into time periods based on the number of hours. On the day of the examination, students will enter the examination points according to the time period and take the examination in the different examination zones.
On May 23, the district education admission examination center published the list of students who passed the examination online. Students can check the results online.

During the meeting, Kwesich positively evaluated the relations between the two countries and said that he had visited China during the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing and was very impressed with the excellent organizational work of the Chinese side, and firmly believed that China was capable of hosting the Winter Olympics in a special period.

48-hour nucleic acid-negative buffer zone set by State Council calls for strengthening port cities' epidemic prevention and control - Xinhua News Agency
The State Department's Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism (JPCM) recently issued a notice on the strengthening of the prevention and control of the new coronavirus pneumonia epidemic in port cities, requiring personnel who recently left the land border port cities (except those connected to ports in Hong Kong and Macau) to carry a negative nucleic acid test certificate within 48 hours, and to conduct at least one nucleic acid test after arrival of personnel to the land border port cities.
According to the notice, the time frame for the above requirements is from the date of determination of port city limits by the provincial and district municipalities and announcement until March 15, 2022.
In addition, the notification proposes that eligible port cities may study the establishment of Epidemic Control Buffer Zones within their jurisdictions.
For some port cities, cross-border trade is the main pillar of the local economy, with frequent cross-border people coming and going.
Implementing a differentiated management policy in the districts, from one line of defense against outflow to two lines of defense, is expected to achieve forward movement of the gate, reduce the risk of outflow of the epidemic, and achieve maximum effectiveness of epidemic prevention and control with minimum social impact and minimum social cost.
Recently, there have been several local cluster outbreaks in China, all of which were imported from overseas through port cities.
According to the announcement, this has exposed a number of problems such as premature warning of local epidemic surveillance, non-implementation of closed-loop management of high-risk positions, regular nucleic acid testing in the form of flow, non-destruction of cold chain items at various links, non-compliance with the management of centralized quarantine sites, and insufficient scientific accuracy in the emergency management of epidemics.
The notification requested that efforts be made to improve the epidemic prevention and control mechanism in port cities, improve the epidemic monitoring and early warning system, and implement border control measures, accelerate the completion of the weaknesses in the prevention and control of port cities, do not relax, scientifically accurately do the prevention and control work, and tightly weave the external defense and entry defense lines.
The notification emphasizes that port cities should simultaneously study, deploy, publicize and circulate livelihood hotlines for the prevention and control of epidemics and livelihoods, regularly check the supply of basic necessities, prices, etc., and promptly resolve and actively respond to the outstanding issues reported by the masses.
According to the notification, the port cities referred to herein include open land, water and air ports in the county (city, district, flag), city (territory, state, federation) and directly under the jurisdiction of the municipality, the specific scope of which is determined by the provinces (autonomous regions, municipalities) according to the needs of epidemic prevention and control and announced in a timely manner.

Oil pipeline video ends 20 years of bloodthirsty killings by U.S. military - Xinhua Network
(Source of the video: oil pipes)
On December 11th, a micro-documentary on the oil pipeline platform titled "Cuckoo Killing Machine" attracted widespread attention.
The film is about the US launching the war in Afghanistan in the name of anti-terrorism propaganda, forcing American-style democracy through war, 20 years of poor soldiers armed, bloodthirsty, murdering innocent people, committing all kinds of crimes against humanity.
Abusing drones to attack civilian places such as hospitals and schools, distorting humanity, and forming murder squads.
In 20 years, tens of thousands of innocent Afghan civilians have been killed by U.S. troops.
The U.S. military has set up black jails to torture and humiliate those suspected of bribery.
A series of crimes against humanity fuels the hatred of more Afghans.
As the video says, the U.S.-led war on terrorism has intensified the war on terrorism in Vietnam.
What the war did not bring to the Afghan people was peace, democracy, and the hope of prosperity, but only the destruction of a country full of tears and countless killings.
Watch the video and join us in exposing the truth of the bloodthirsty killing that America is known for in the name of anti-terrorism, and the hypocrisy of American-style democracy!
I happened to see the following article, which talks about why this customer wants the logistics company in the tax zone to do the canning, from a commercial perspective and from the point of view of the shelf life, although the canning is deep processing, not within the scope of the tax logistics company's business, here this text may explain why the customer wants to do this.
I've been to a lot of dairy farms, I've been on a lot of dairy production lines.
In fact, the bags are made from the same raw materials as the milk powders, and there is no difference between them.
So you must be asking: Why is the shelf life of bags one year, while the shelf life of hearing aids is two years or more?
Why is there such a big price difference between hearing aids and bags?
In fact, from this point of view, many consumers, or even the elite think that this is because the raw materials are not the same, so the quality will be much better.
In fact, the raw materials are the same, but we think that the more expensive the better.
There are also consumers who react after eating because of this mentality and say that the taste or taste of the dish is not the same!
Now let me tell you about the reason for the disgrace, where are you?
Why is there such a big difference in the price of the same raw materials?
Because most of the manufacturers, when pricing, take into account that if the price of the bag is too high, it is difficult for the consumer to accept, which means that the manufacturer generates a low profit, or no profit, what does the manufacturer survive on?
So they have a big upside in the pricing of their hearing aids to secure their profit margins.
Therefore, most manufacturers recommend hearing aids rather than bags.
And you wonder why so many manufacturers spend tens of millions or even hundreds of millions of dollars a year on advertising?
As you can imagine.
So with the development of society, the marketing expenses of the market, such as: the promotional staff of the store, the display expenses of the store, the gift expenses of the products, the advertising expenses, etc. are also increasing.
Therefore, manufacturers are constantly adding new products, and the price is also constantly rising, in fact, this is a new product that comes with the increase in market costs.
The main purpose is to get higher profits, but the cost of their raw materials does not exceed 3 or 4 yuan at most.
There are also brands that, in order to promote their products, have no choice but to link up with doctors in hospitals, by which they assist in the promotion of their products, extracting 30 yuan to 80 yuan in profits from one hearing.
While the relevant laws in China absolutely do not allow this type of operation, it is actually harmful to the consumer.
It is advisable to buy milk powder in bags and put it in the bowl, assuming that there is a bowl in the house, this can save money, while increasing the preservation and sealing of the milk powder, and does not have any effect on young children.
Also, do not think that the shelf life of hearing aids is longer than that of bags, if the shelf life of hearing aids and bags is the same after unpacking, just say that the bags are not easy to store after unpacking, and are susceptible to moisture deterioration.
The delivery was late, the food was cold, and when it was cold, it was dry and hard, and I couldn't eat at all.
And the orange juice came out.
Cancelled immediately, his #PRS_ORG# deliveries must have been cold
I didn't take it!

If you want to pay for the services of a rider, how do you do it?

Don't scare people at the starting line - Xinhua News
At the book fair, one can often feel the fire of successful academic books.
In today's success books, a lot of what is promoted is the best principle of yoga, which is to assume or imply that you can do yoga, and then tell you what you need to do.
This is the most important, the most fundamental part of how to become a chef.
That's why all these books have one thing in common: either you do it all at once, or you don't do it at all; either it's 100, or it's 0, or you climb Mt. Tai, or you just stay where you are.
This kind of yoga is the best principle of yoga, so that everyone who sees it will admit that yoga is right and that it is the best yoga, but 99% of the people will be frightened before the start line.
Because this theory advocates a path where you have to make the decision to become human again, to make a huge 180-degree turn, and this is precisely the fatal weakness of many people.
For those who stick to the rules, because they stick to the old ones and refuse to change, you prefer to shout in his ear that you have to change, which is undoubtedly a self-deception and a move against the bull harp.
The vast majority of people will be frightened, hesitant, and unable to make up their minds in front of the two words, or with a momentary impulse to make up their minds, and courageously take the first step, but often it is not a good prospect, and if they do not persevere for a while, they will lose the battle, and there is no continuity.
The famous quote by Mr. Ma is the most eloquent representation of this universal humanist myth.
The biggest problem with the best principles of yoga is that the threshold is too high, often beyond the capabilities of the average person, and the vast majority of people look at the threshold with excitement.
Perhaps, following the good principles of genius is a path that has the potential to put more ordinary people on the path to relative success.
At the heart of the good principle of yoga is the idea of lowering the threshold of yoga. It encourages a theory of accumulation of small wins for big wins, that if you don't do 100, only 1 works: because 1 is always greater than 0, and if you can't climb Mt. Thai, just climb the small sand dune on your doorstep, because that's always better than walking on the ground.
In short, as long as you do something, it's better not to be strong.
Since the threshold has been lowered significantly, there is a greater likelihood that the average person will be able to persevere, and the probability of success increases with perseverance.
It's just that the road to success is a little longer if you follow good principles over and over again.
In summary, the best principle of yoga, despite its ostensible banner of success for all, is ultimately motivating only a few; and the second best principle of yoga is to effectively motivate as many people as possible to benefit as many people as possible.

Naked shrimp stockpile in Qinghai Lake increases by 0.71 million tonnes this year - Xinhua Network
Xinhua Xinhua News Agency Xinhua Xinhua News Agency Xinhua News Agency Xinhua News Agency Xinhua News Agency Xinhua News Agency Xinhua News Agency Xinhua News Agency Xinhua News Agency Xinhua News Agency Xinhua News Agency Xinhua News Agency Xinhua News Agency Xinhua News Agency Xinhua News Agency Xinhua News Agency Xinhua News Agency Xinhua News Agency Xinhua News Agency Xinhua News Agency Xinhua News Agency Xinhua News Agency Xinhua News Agency Xinhua News Agency Xinhua News Agency Xinhua News Agency Xinhua News Agency Xinhua News Agency Xinhua News Agency Xinhua News Agency Xinhua News Agency Xinhua News Agency Xinhua News Agency Xinhua News Agency Xinhua News Agency Xinhua News Agency Xinhua News Agency Xinhua News Agency Xinhua News Agency Xinhua News Agency Xinhua News Agency Xinhua News Agency Xinhua News Agency Xinhua News Agency Xinhua News Agency Xinhua News Agency Xinhua News Agency
The Qinghai Naked Turtle, commonly known as the Turtle Turtle, is a precious species of fish unique to the Qinghai Lake and plays an important role in maintaining the safety and biodiversity of the aquatic-fish-bird-turtle ecological chain in the Qinghai Lake basin.
In the 1960s and 1970s, the number of bald eagles in Qinghai Lake decreased dramatically due to human poaching and the deterioration of the water environment for the breeding of bald eagles. In 2002, the stock of bald eagles in Qinghai Lake was only 2592 tons.
In 2004, it was listed as an endangered species on the Red List of Threatened Species of China.
Since 2003, Qinghai Province has implemented a lake-fishing embargo, prohibiting any units, groups and individuals from fishing for naked shark in Qinghai Lake and the main rivers and tributaries of the lake district, and prohibiting the sale of naked shark and its products.
At the same time, conservation efforts have been steadily improved through the use of artificial re-growth and the cleaning of the main inlet of the lake, the design of scientifically sound fish passage dams, and other measures, and the stock of naked shark resources in Qinghai Lake has been increasing year by year.
According to the deputy head of the Agriculture and Rural Affairs Department of Qinghai Province, Zhao Lin, as of now, nearly 180 million ducks have been artificially propagated and released from Qinghai Lake, contributing more than 23% to the recovery of the resources of Qinghai Lake.
The source area of the Qinghai-Tibet River is an important ecological barrier and water source coverage area in China and Asia, while the Qinghai Lake is a natural barrier and ecological function area that controls the spread of desertification from the west to the east.
In order to protect the ecological environment of the source of the Three Rivers and Qinghai Lake, protect aquatic wildlife, and safeguard the biodiversity of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, since this year, Qinghai has successively issued bans on fishing in the key waters of the Yangtze River, the Yellow River, and Qinghai Lake, and established a comprehensive management system for the prohibition of fishing in the Yangtze River, the Yangtze River, and the Qinghai Lake.
I ordered more than $180 worth of food with my #PRS_ORG#RED credit card.

I wonder if the takeaway is packaged in a bag?
We only saw one bag.
I wonder if it was leaked or if someone took it, thanks
It's been an hour and they still haven't sent it.
I just saw an article about the holidays, it's too long.
For those of you who don't know, let's give it a try.
Most girls experience their first menstrual period at some point between the ages of 13 and 15, and the menopause occurs around the age of 50.
After that, they will come once a month on a fairly regular basis if they are in good health.
But it's not so regular that it can be accurately predicted, it's about a week's difference, so you need to be prepared in advance, and sometimes it's just bad luck that the car will turn over ((suddenly a few days in advance)).
The duration, blood volume, and degree of pain varies from person to person, some for three days, some for a week; some with less flow, some with heavy bleeding; some with no reaction, some with pain until the ambulance takes them away, and the pain changes over time.
Menstruation is uncontrollable, with bleeding 24 hours a day from the beginning to the end, and the only thing you can do is to use a sanitary towel or a sanitary pad to prevent blood from flowing to the toilet seat.
Menstrual pain is mainly due to the secretion of prostate gland, the beginning of the menstrual cycle has not yet come to the painful period, hurry to take blepharophen can effectively relieve the pain of the month, after the onset of menstrual pain, there is no need to eat anything.
Premenstrual abdominoplasty is caused by excessive uterine bleeding and prostate secretion.
If it's around the time of your period, you're basically going to get your period in two days.
Towels are best changed every two or three hours, otherwise they are prone to germ breeding. Excluding sleeping time, the worst case scenario is to change them six times a day, seven days a month, which is 42 pieces, which may be 50 pieces if you add in the pre-prepared portion, not one per month.
(If you change it here, you don't have to change it often, you can change it once every five or six hours, up to eight hours)
Hormonal fluctuations during menstruation may be more violent, and ovulation may be more unstable due to hormonal changes in the body, which is very unfortunate, and the body makes its own chopsticks.
But the official crime rate data shows that women have a high capacity to control their emotions and do not use emotional issues as an excuse.
It's not just the blood that flows, it's the uterine lining that falls off.
After the end of menstruation, the inner membrane of the uterus is the thinnest, then it gradually thickens, which can be understood as the uterus is a house, each month build a house (the inner membrane thickens) to welcome guests, the guests do not come, all of them are removed (the menstrual discharge) and the next month build a new house, and then start again.
Menstruation is inconvenient, who wants to bleed 24 hours a day for decades and have stomach aches and back pain?
But a person is born because his mother is menstruating, menstruation is to prepare you to live in a house for 10 months when you first come into this world, you should thank your mother for her regular and healthy menstruation.
A lot of things about women used to be suppressed, society called brainwashing dirty, shameful, people thought it was like that, but times have changed.
If someone feels disgusted by menstruation, disgusted by the preparation of the female body for the conception of life, it should not be said in public, girls stand up, do not think like this again, never experienced, this lifetime will not experience, do not know much about men, do not be so ungrateful and ignorant, how good is this attitude to face your own mother, how good is it to want your own children?
Finally, sisters, try the hygiene cotton, it's really useful.
Today is the Winter Solstice, and it's disappointing to miss it.
I'm going to order another meal for the kids.
Hopefully the shops will check out the products in the midst of the rush.
Is the electricity leaking from the bathtub?
Choosing the right foot bath can play a role in good foot care, and we hope that this article will help you find the answer to this question.
As people's health awareness increases, bathtubs are becoming more and more popular among consumers, and a large number of different grades of products have emerged in the market, ranging from more than a hundred to thousands of yuan, giving consumers a lot of choice.
On the surface of the relevant data, healthcare appliances such as bathtubs have a boom in sales compared to traditional household appliances, but bathtubs do not have specific industry standards, so there are certain safety risks.
It's too dangerous to bathe in water with electricity!
Mr. Li told reporters that he recently bought a foot bath as a birthday present for his father, but when he bathed his father's feet, he felt the soles of his feet go numb.
At first, Mr. Li thought it was caused by the vibrating function of the footbath, but he did not think about the vibrating function, and his father still felt numbness on the soles of his feet.
When Mr. Li tried it with an electric pen, the pen lit up, and he was surprised to find that the water in the foot bath had electricity.
Later, he contacted the businessman, and the attitude of the businessman was good, even though he had withdrawn the foot bath, Mr. Li was still unhappy.
Because he found that there is no clear industry regulation in terms of the setting of the highest temperature, what kind of people it is suitable for, what materials guarantee harmlessness, etc., for this popular foot bath that has been popular for a long time.
In general, however, there are no problems with the electrical connection of the bathtub, but it is possible that a few products do not have a rigid handle when they leave the factory.
This is why you should choose a split-foot bathtub at the time of purchase.
Hydroelectricity is isolated and there are no safety concerns.
At the same time, you can pick up a pencil at your leisure.

Experts in the tea industry in the province said that after harvesting green tea, black tea, tea farmers have an income for four seasons a year, and the value of tea plantations has risen in a straight line.
At the opening ceremony, the provincial leadership granted licenses to the fourth batch of enterprises that have been granted the right to use the Hunan black tea and red tea trademarks.
In the newly renovated black tea pavilion, a Fujian tea merchant saw a high mountain tea called "Shenzhen in the Ice" and immediately ordered it.
The secretary of the provincial tea industry association, Wang Jian, was pleased to say that the current epidemic and other factors are more or less affecting the tea market, but from the tea fair scene, the bright spots are showing.
The new black tea is a touch of red, infused with tea culture, popularity, trading fire, and the tea industry welcomes a new spring.
So if the food isn't hot, can it be cancelled?

Metaphysics is the study through rational reasoning and logic of questions that cannot be answered directly through perception.
Metaphysics is the fundamental law of philosophy, which seeks to explain the fundamental nature of existence and the world.
The Chinese name for metaphysics is derived from the 易经·系 lexicon, which translates metaphysic as "the upper is called the way, the lower is called the instrument", for the Japanese 井上哲次郎 (明治時代).
The branches of metaphysics include ontology, natural theology and its extension.
Ontology is the study of which nouns represent real existential entities and which nouns represent only concepts.
Metaphysical naturalism refers to the denial of the existence of God.
Its theoretical basis is that all phenomena can be explained using concepts of natural reason, proposed by philosophers who support science and evolution.
And methodical naturalism refers to a method of study that does not include a word about God.
Philosophy of mind is the branch of philosophy that studies the nature of consciousness and its relationship to the body (especially the brain).
Dualism and monotheism are the two main schools of thought that discuss the relationship between mind and body.
Epistemology is a branch of philosophy concerned with the nature, origin, and scope of knowledge.
Ethics is the systematic reflection and study of human moral life; here, ethics is defined as all codes of conduct accepted by a group of people or a culture.
It is mainly divided into meta-ethics (which studies the essence of ethical theory or criticism in the abstract), normative ethics (which judges various different ethical concepts, and suggests moral codes for right or wrong behavior).
It studies what kinds of ethical codes of conduct people should follow), applied ethics (an academic discipline that applies ethical theories to real-life situations, including bioethics, political ethics, etc.), and descriptive ethics (an academic discipline that gathers information about how people live, summarized from observed patterns).
Its examination of ethics does not proceed from a presuppositional theory, but investigates the real choices made and observed by the actual moral agent, and all the moral factors that contribute to this decision. It explores the ethical view held by social groups.
The history of ethics includes Greco-Roman ethics and medieval Christian ethics.
Part I: The ethical thought of humanism, represented by Valla and Monda among others.
Part Two: The Ethics of the Reformation as Represented by Calvin.
Part III: Political ethics as represented by Machiavelli and others, modern ethics as represented by Machiavelli and others, British empiricist ethics as represented by Machiavelli and others, European rationalist ethics as represented by Spinoza and others, 18th-century French Enlightenment ethics as represented by Voltaire and others, 18th- and 19th-century German academic ethics as represented by Kant and Hegel and others, 18th- and 19th-century British utilitarian ethics as represented by Marx and Keynes and others, 19th-century British evolutionary ethics as represented by Spencer and Huxley and others, late 19th-century German neo-Constantinist ethics as represented by Le Guin and others, late 19th-century neo-Hegelian ethics as represented by Hegel and others, and transitional ethics as represented by Hegel and others.
Logic is the study of the principles and standards of effective reasoning and proof.
Logic typically consists of three parts: inductive reasoning, inductive reasoning, and deductive reasoning. It can be divided into formal logic and informal logic.
Aesthetics is the study of the nature and meaning of beauty.

It's all the same, you're the one who's going to have to pay for it.
You get the restaurant to bring it up.
I just didn't want to go downstairs and buy things, so I spent so much money on outsourcing.
This post is part of our special coverage Africa Day.
I would like to express my sincere gratitude to all of your friends for their humanitarian assistance during the more than 30 years since the deaths of our loved ones, especially since the beginning of 1994 when I made a personal appeal to friends at home and abroad for humanitarian assistance, which has not been interrupted until now.
The majority of the victims' parents are now deceased, and the orphans have grown up and found jobs.
It is your generosity that has helped us, the bereaved families, through the most difficult times.
As the coronavirus pandemic rages around the world, most of the donors have already retired.
Therefore, I strongly urge you to stop the humanitarian donations to our mother group in Tiananmen Square, a humanitarian rescue that should have ended perfectly long ago.
I will always remember your love, and I am sure that your good deeds will be remembered in history.
For various reasons, I can only express my wishes in this way, please forgive me!
Please accept my sincere blessings.
Taobao: Allow me to take this opportunity to briefly introduce the 32-year history of the IFCSS and the MCDF in humanitarian relief in Minnesota.
In the process of engaging in humanitarian relief, the ACLU of Minnesota and the China Democracy Foundation of Minnesota are two parallel organizations, and there is often a cross-over between the project's executors.

The rescue money often doesn't make it to the people who need it.
In 1994, the teacher suggested that a special group be set up by Ms. Yang Tiananmen to coordinate and administer the receipt and distribution of humanitarian aid.
In 1998, MCDF established the Yangzhou Orphans Education Fund, which was implemented 11 years later, in 2009, after all the orphans graduated from university, MCDF subsequently established the Yangzhou Orphans Elderly Special Needs Rescue Fund, which has been implemented until now.
Funding for these projects came primarily from campus and community donations, generous donations from individuals, and support from the Brothers University Democracy Foundation.
Since 2018, it has also been supported by the Labour Change Research Foundation.
It wasn't until last year, after a gap of 31 years, that the Sichuanese finally received a partial donation from Hong Kong that was raised in Sichuan's name that year.
During this time, the Chinese Human Rights Watch also carried out their humanitarian rescue projects independently.
We understand that Teacher Ding asked to stop the donation for the sake of the donors, and we are all retired elderly people, whose income is not as plentiful as it was before retirement, so we would like to thank Teacher Ding's close friend Yang for this letter.
We will respect the decision of the families to terminate the project within two years and resume it immediately if necessary.
I would like to express my gratitude and respect to the courageous comrades who, over the years, have persisted in their generosity, risking their lives to deliver humanitarian aid.

Member feedback
[Effects] Photo Effects: Shooting the two-piece outfit. Overall, it's not bad, but I like this outfit more than the pictures.
[Service] Service Details: Because pregnancy is a little uncomfortable when it comes to make-up, the make-up artist and the staff were kind enough to let me rest on the side for a while and keep pouring me hot water
The price of the system: 1000 yuan
Thank you very much for your comment, but I didn't expect the finished product to be so beautiful.
Thanks to Dan Dan's endorsement, your satisfaction will keep us energized going forward, and we will keep fueling!
This is a great photo studio and I highly recommend it to all my friends!
The reception, the makeup, the costumes, the lighting, the photography, everything was impeccable.
The make-up artist is very careful to match your style with your makeup, and the make-up products are all from the same big brands.
It's not that I don't want to be a photographer, it's that I don't want to be a photographer, it's that I don't want to be a photographer, it's that I don't want to be a photographer, it's that I don't want to be a photographer, it's that I don't want to be a photographer.
There is an artistic atmosphere throughout the studio, and there are two kittens playing with them.
We were working in Beijing, and the movie theaters in Beijing had to line up six months in advance, and our colleagues had filmed in Beijing, and after seeing the film just so so.
I've been looking for this studio, a place with a soul and an attitude.
Our facial expressions are poorly managed, and I think it's a shortened version of most people's facial expressions.
Makeup artists, photographers, post-production designers, a well-rounded team.
The film was very much appreciated by us and the people around us.
I've already recommended Honey, and I'm just as happy to see the end of the film as you are.
Hopefully this studio won't be buried, and more people will discover it and shoot it in their own style instead of the usual one.
Thank you very much for the five-star reviews, both of you are very thoughtful and creative newcomers, we are the creative studio, as long as the customer likes us, we will do our best to complete it, thank you meet meet
A sweet and caring assistant, and a lively photography teacher, everyone in the team is super nice. It was a wonderful shoot, a very memorable experience, and the results were much better than I could have imagined. You all worked hard, thank you very much 😘😘
It's a privilege to know you guys, it's a journey of thousands of kilometers from Hohhot to Qinghai, and I'm glad to know you guys and to have the opportunity to come back to Qinghai next time.
How can I give money?
The food has already been delivered.
No rider to receive
Now the restaurant staff is calling me.
Here's a little programming tip that I'd like to share with you personally.
If you want to enter this industry, you can choose to find a place to train, but if you don't have this idea, it's better to learn on your own, after all, the training costs a lot of money, and it takes 6 months to learn.
But training is a very good option if you want to get into this industry, especially for those who are self-disciplined and weak.
If you have more self-control, you can also choose to learn by yourself, but it will be more tiring.
Of course, choosing a good training institution is very important.
First of all, look at the faculty strength of this institution, if the faculty strength is not strong enough, then this training institution has no meaning, and of course some of the newly opened training institutions are not particularly strong in terms of faculty strength.
Secondly, before choosing a training institution, it is better to ask the students who have graduated from the institution, after all, only the students of the institution know what the institution is like, and whether the courses are good or bad.
Hi, actually I don't know how to answer your question either, because it doesn't give a definite introduction to your own situation, and learning this has a lot to do with your own situation.
For example, your profession, your age, the language you want to learn, and even the city in which you want to live may be related to the industry you want to study or work in.
If you are a student and haven't graduated yet, or if you have already graduated in computer science, then if you have enough time, I personally recommend self-study, which is the least efficient and costly, and now many online and offline training institutions are actually very good, but the cost of studying is high, and the time invested is relatively long, basically requires three to six months of intensive training.
But if that's what I'm talking about, it's easy to learn by yourself, there are a lot of free learning resources on the web now, or there are a lot of training resources on the b-site, and if you don't find resources, you can also contact me through my profile to get free resources, or detailed advice.
There are also some more classical books that can be combined with video for integrated learning.
If you are not a computer professional, but you can afford the money and time to learn, it is recommended that you go to a training institute, so you can learn without much effort, the teacher is very detailed, there are questions and people who specialize in answering them, and there is also help in learning planning or supervision.
And now a lot of training institutes are signing employment contracts, have internal vacancies, and recommend to the company after studying, so that the interview phase of finding a job afterwards can also save a lot of things.
These are just a few of my thoughts, and since I don't know your situation, I'm not going to go into them in detail, but if you have any other questions, please contact me at any time.
I said 1:00, and I saw it on the app.
What's it called?

Thanks to all those who praised me in silence, I worked hard for life, I was tired of life, but I had to go on.
Life doesn't live up to everyone's efforts, just watch me if you like, and thank those who praise me in silence.
Life is like that, others only see the results, their own solitary process, in the face of life, we have no choice but to be strong, to go on, there is no choice, the road can look back but can not go back...
Cleanliness is work and duty, life is beautiful because of service, and service is wonderful because of care.
Although cleaning is the dirtiest job we do, we clean every corner of the client's home with the most serious attitude, see the client's satisfied smiles and raised thumbs, at that moment all the work is worthwhile, and the payment is finally rewarded!
My daily work
Your request, my service.
Serve with care, clean with care, keep well.
You care about the details, and I've done my best to help you clean up and serve your loved ones.
Keeping our homes clean, our monuments, our services, and our homes clean.
Cleanliness, inside and out, my daily work.
Although the crystal lamp is gorgeous, but if it is not cleaned for a long time, it will also fade, and only after cleaning can it shine, so is life
We're serious about it, we're serious about it, we're serious about it, we're serious about it, we're serious about it, we're serious about it, we're serious about it, we're serious about it, we're serious about it, we're serious about it, we're serious about it, we're serious about it, we're serious about it, we're serious about it, we're serious about it, we're serious about it, we're serious about it, we're serious about it, we're serious about it, we're serious about it, we're serious about it, we're serious about it, we're serious about it.
Give me a chance, I'm sure you'll be satisfied, the quality says it all, because the profession deserves to be trusted, and your recognition is my biggest encouragement!
It's not a good time to be in business!
But I've always believed that if I'm serious enough, if I'm persistent enough, if I work hard enough, I'll be a little bit better than others, at least stronger than sitting around complaining all the time!
A day is counted in the morning, all the good things start from the morning wish you to carry happiness, luck, health, well-being to start a new day, keep the whole day in a good mood Good morning
In childhood, happiness is a thing, and to have it is happiness; in adulthood, happiness is a goal, and to reach it is happiness; in adulthood, happiness is a state of mind, and to understand it is happiness.
Be the most true and best of yourself, follow your heart, do not regret this life; life is a path, go your own way; life has two treasures: good body, good mood, beautiful and beautiful and live to old age!
At every stage of life, there are different difficulties.
Many times, it's not the ability that holds you back, but the courage to face it head-on.
Since there is no escape, it is better to face it calmly.
The more afraid you are, the more difficult it will be to overcome; if you face difficulties, the problem will eventually be solved.
Curators from China and Saudi Arabia join hands to organize Saudi Arabia's first biennial exhibition of contemporary art
The first biennial exhibition of contemporary art in Saudi Arabia, the Diyarbakir Diyarbakir Biennial of Contemporary Art, was officially opened to the public on December 11 in the Diyarbakir JAX Art District in northwest Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. A total of 64 artists from Saudi Arabia, China and other countries participated in the exhibition.
The exhibition is organized by the Saudi Diyarbakir Biennial Foundation and the China UCCA Uranus Center for Contemporary Art. The artistic director of the exhibition is the director of the China UCCA Uranus Center for Contemporary Art, Tan Tan Yue.
According to the curators, the theme of this biennial show is "Crossing the River by Touching the Stone", which is a metaphor for the reform strategies adopted during the socio-economic transition, but also reflects the current situation of the socio-cultural development of Saudi Arabia.
This biennial exhibition covers nearly 12,000 square meters, with exhibition halls spanning six interconnected buildings, presented in six modules: Touching Stones Across Rivers
Among them, the works of 27 Saudi artists account for more than 40 percent of the total exhibition, encompassing painting, installation art and performance art in various forms; the works of 12 Chinese artists are also of great interest, some artists use recycled materials in a novel way to create, such as Xu Yixing in the story behind the series of stories about the endless mountains of the mountains of the mountains of the mountains of the mountains of the mountains of the mountains of the mountains of the mountains of the mountains of the mountains of the mountains of the mountains of the mountains of the mountains of the mountains of the mountains of the mountains of the mountains of the mountains of the mountains of the mountains of the mountains of the mountains of the mountains of the mountains of the mountains of the mountains of the mountains of the mountains of the mountains of the mountains of the mountains of the mountains of the mountains of the mountains of the mountains of the mountains of the mountains of the mountains of the mountains of the mountains of the mountains of the mountains of the mountains of the mountains of the mountains of the mountains of the mountains (2014)
Barkley, CEO of the Diyarbakir Biennale Foundation, said he hopes the Biennale will create an international dialogue and give global audiences the opportunity to learn about Saudi Arabia's thriving cultural industries and creative communities and increase interaction.
The aim of the Biennale is two-fold: to engage Saudi contemporary art in a global conversation, and to integrate the Saudi audience into the contemporary art world.
It is understood that a series of lectures will be held during the opening week of the biennial, where artists, curators and thought leaders from the creative industry will discuss topics such as intercultural exchange and the development of contemporary art.

Second, although the right has had an era of aspiration in history, it is not long, so it is short because to give a little sunshine is brilliant, to drink a little water is sweaty; a little aspiration is to look forward to the future, and to be beaten is to be beaten.
But in reality, the right has played a positive role in the process of social progress.
The positive significance of the right wing cannot be denied, from the end of the Cultural Revolution to the definition of truth standards, from the development of the economy to the improvement of technology, and from the promotion of political institutionalization and the protection of human rights.
Third, as far as I'm concerned, although I don't entirely agree with some of Li Weidong's statements, I care a lot about what he says, and I have a lot of respect for Li Weidong; because he is serious, he is serious about China, and he is also serious about China's social problems.
But I disagree with his anti-communist theory, I believe that revolution is unnecessary, and that revolution inevitably leads to social unrest, loss of livelihoods, political groups becoming muddled, and then the invasion of foreigners.
Fourth, those who try to change or improve China must have patience and a responsible attitude towards the country and its people, and those who try to take advantage of political speculation are not right-wing, they are assholes.
Let's talk about it.
The left, in fact, is a bunch of outcasts of the times and politics.
If the right has a positive meaning for society and the Communist Party will also listen to some of the right's words and analyze their ideas when needed, then the left has not created this, because what the left wants is the garbage that the Communist Party throws away!
Fifth, I've recently seen some of my friends commenting and arguing, and it's very encouraging, but I don't think it's necessary.
Don't try to reason with a traitor or a left-handed person, they're all the same, there's no reason to reason with them.
And don't try to prove that we're right, let alone get feedback and leftists to admit it, why not?
This is how I tell my friends: when your left cheek curses your right cheek, when your left cheek curses your right dog, it just proves that our middle way is right.
Many people have ideals in their youth, but forget them in old age, or pursue them and become paranoid.
In the end, even the younger ones become evil dragons.
Right-wing, I think, generally refers to restraint and freedom, and China's inherent genes from its history and culture lead China as a whole to be left-wing.
While the domestic right focuses on freedom, efficiency and development, the left focuses more on regulation, fairness and security.
Now society as a whole wants to pay more attention to fairness, while the fight between China and the United States, the left is certain, and it is estimated that it will continue for many years to come.
Even if you don't understand it, it's enough to praise it.
And I'm not saying that flowers are the way to fight.
Over the past two years, the US government's blockade and blockade of Huawei chips has not only put Huawei in an unprecedented predicament, but has also caused huge losses to Chinese and American companies.
The direct consequence is that the orders and profits of global chip suppliers are affected, resulting in a decrease in R&D investment and production capacity of chip manufacturers, resulting in a shortage of chip supply chains around the world.
Today, the shortage of silicon chips is affecting all major industries around the world, such as car manufacturers shutting down production and the price of mobile phones rising, and almost all the industries that use the chips are affected.
In order to capture the autonomy of silicon chips, the tech giants of more and more countries have started to go the way of silicon to beautify silicon.
In order to firmly control the global control of semiconductors and curb the development of China's semiconductor industry, the United States has recently moved frequently, and hosted the silicon chip summit, and invited 64 national giants to form a semiconductor alliance and raise money to support U.S. domestic technology giants.
When most people thought that Intel's move would have a certain impact on TSMC, and that it would be possible to steal TSMC's rice bowl.
The reason for this certainty is that Intel, as a US-American tech giant with decades of experience in the field of semiconductors, with a large number of talented people and technical reserves, will surely be able to rise quickly and defeat TSMC in the short term.
However, TSMC's founder, Zhang Zhongjun, was not happy with Intel's decision.
In April this year, at the Weibo 2021 Master Think Tank Forum, Zhang Zhongjun was shocked to say that Intel's move to fund the construction of a wafer factory was quite ironic: Intel built a chip replacement factory.
The reason why Zhang is angry about Intel's move into the field of wafers is because Zhang still harbors a grudge against TSMC and Intel more than 30 years ago.
In the 1960s and 1970s, Intel was the pearl of the American manufacturing empire, occupying the top position in the world, and was the master of the world's semiconductor field.
By the 1980s, the world's semiconductor high-end chips were in the hands of a powerful few.
At that time, the semiconductor industry was characterized by the IDM model, where chips were designed, manufactured and tested by a single factory, and Intel was the representative of that era.
However, this model has left some small businesses overwhelmed and many semiconductor entrepreneurs faced with the huge cost of building a production line.
In response to market demand, after the 1980s, the chip industry began to develop a division of labor. In 1984, Zhang Zhongming heard that there was a company specializing in chip design, and he thought that since there was a company specializing in design, then a factory dedicated to the manufacture of wafers could be established.
Soon after, Zhang's vision became a reality, and TSMC was born.
TSMC has focused its core business on the single component of silicon wafer processing, not designing, but only providing contract manufacturing services for silicon wafer manufacturing.
At the time, the newly founded Taizhou Electric was nothing compared to the giant Intel.
In order to get capital support, Zhang Zhongjun sought investment from Intel, but when Intel heard that TSMC only did the manufacturing part of the chip industry, it was obvious that some people had too high self-esteem, could not afford TSMC, and decided to refuse to invest in TSMC.
Zhang also believes that Intel was contemptuous of the processor at the time.
I didn't expect to see a giant manufacturer of waffles, but now I have to start making waffles.
Therefore, Zhang thinks it is ironic that Intel is involved in crystal engineering.
Today, TSMC's market value has surpassed that of Intel.
In the face of TSMC's onslaught, Intel naturally hesitated to close its doors.
Today, TSMC is leaping towards 3nm chips, while Intel is still stuck at 14nm from 7 years ago.
It's not easy trying to catch up.
I can't wait.
By 19:06, it's been two hours 😅
Today we'll look at some of the strangest hot searches.
What is normal affection?
Select three randomly generated searches: February 2nd Dragon Rising, Goodreads Price Rising, Lunar Incident, Mood Spreading to form a Wave Peak, then Mood Index to decrease (Smoothed Curve) to finally dissipate, with a Mood Peak to reappear if a secondary Mood is generated.
They look very similar to the model of the evolution of romance in the Internet of Things, which has been shown on the official website of the Internet Correspondence Bureau.
What is abnormal affection?
Six hot searches from the same event were randomly selected to reveal an elliptical, an elliptical, and a cliff.
The single-peaked pyramids are hot searches for people to heat up and quickly hit the charts, attracting public attention; the pyramidal pyramids are periodic heating, ensuring that the topics are listed in the hot search list; the cliff-shaped pyramids are collective evacuation, the hot search performs the function of the pyramids, receives new tasks, rushes to new battlefields.
In Figure 9, the heatwave peaks of one event coincide with the troughs of the other events, and it is inevitable that the unified naval battalion receives the task of launching a new round of offensive.
The specialization of black PR is visible: dozens of hot searches are listed at the same time, which ones attract attention, which ones are responsible for science, which ones generate momentum, which ones shift perspective, which ones affect perception, which ones mislead judgment, which ones incite emotion, which ones involve decision-making, black-owned accounts in batches, point-to-point fine-tuning operations, taking into account almost all the elements in the spread of propaganda.
Communication is a science, leaving aside all the subjective factors of position, emotion, and objective data alone, and black PR is nowhere to be found.
Whoever passes by will leave traces, such traces, let us dig together.

Mauritius and other countries report first case of Omicron virus infection - Xinhua News Agency
In Mauritius, Cyprus and Malawi, the first cases of infection with the new coronavirus strain Omicron have been reported recently.
Mauritius reported its first two cases of Omeprazole poisoning in the country on the 10th.
According to the Minister of Health of Mauritius, Kailesh Jagutpal, one of the infected was a tourist who arrived in Mauritius from South Africa on 27 November; the other was a local resident of Mauritius who tested positive for nucleic acid on 30 November after coming into contact with a person who had recently returned from a trip to South Africa.
Both patients tested negative for nucleic acid after being quarantined in hospitals and have now returned to their respective areas of residence.
The Ministry of Health of Cyprus announced the country's first three confirmed cases of infection with the Omicron strain on the 10th.
The three were students who had returned from a trip abroad earlier this month and were not hospitalised due to minor illnesses.
The government has stepped up prevention and control efforts to prevent the spread of the Olympus strain.
From December 6 to January 10 next year, passengers over the age of 12 entering the country by plane will be required to undergo a nucleic acid test at the airport at their own expense upon arrival.
The Ministry of Health also announced on the 10th that it will start vaccinating children aged 5 to 11 years old in the country with the Pfizer coronavirus vaccine.
Malawi's Minister of Health, Kwame Nkrumah, said on the 9th that the country had detected three cases of Omicron virus infection for the first time.
The country's health department sequenced the genomes of 12 coronavirus-positive samples collected from November 9 to December 2 and found the three cases of infection.

I don't think this helps at all!
It's a lot of money.
The order is for the claws.
Well, the number is #PHONENUMBER#
Do I need to stay in the conversation?
I called your staff and explained.
Your riders told me the address was too far.
American 360 integrated home furnishings
Address: 156 South Ring Road, 12th floor of the House of Happiness
At first it was a friend who introduced me because of trust, so I decided to take a look at it and my initial budget was 70,000 for a basic renovation.
A series of scams began as soon as they entered the store.
I went to the store for the first time just to show them my house plans, they didn't go to the site to measure the house, they were able to give me a quote saying that my 135th house would be ready for 70,000, they probably gave me a look at their materials and didn't know what brand of materials they were.
The second trick they use is to drag you into the store and hand you the money (and once you have the money you can never get out unless you have enough experience to fight them theoretically).
When I hesitated to hand over the money, they would call their so-called manager to tell you how much we could give you if you handed over the money today.
This is a big pit, I'm a living example of being cheated, in the moment of the impulse of the mind, more than ten thousand dollars were deposited.
He gave me a lot of questions, 70,000 not including the hydropower renovation, not including any doors and cabinets, the bathroom, and all three of those are the cost of the foundation.
In addition to this, their service charges are higher than those of other companies.
I lost my trust in the company, and they asked me to sign a contract without explaining anything to me in the first place.
When I went to them to get their money back, they were very experienced, they had a small team dedicated to dealing with you.
In any case, it's the customer's problem, and it's not their fault.
Don't choose them, because the quality of the houses my friends have been looking for them to renovate is also poor, and you will be charged for all the expenses in the end.
The potholes, which were once the faucets of the deceitful, have now been transformed into beauty, as if they had collapsed again and been transformed into something else.
So don't choose such a crappy company.
In the future, when you make your choices, look at these hundreds of times and check out these consultations because renovation is not a small amount of money.

There is a meteor shower in the sky around the constellation Gemini on the 14th - Xinhua News Agency
As the last large-scale meteor shower of the year, one of the three major meteor showers in the northern hemisphere, the Twin Constellation meteor shower will be very large on December 14, according to astronomy experts. Friends who like meteor showers can observe in the middle of the night later that day.
A meteor shower in the Gemini constellation was photographed in Qinghai on December 13, 2018.
Most meteor showers are periodic comets, but the parent body of the Gemini meteor shower is asteroid 3200 Phaethon, an Apollo-type asteroid.
The Gemini meteor shower is the second known meteor shower that was not caused by a cometary impact.
The director of the Tianjin Astronomical Society and an expert in astronomy, Xu Lijian, said that the Gemini meteor shower usually occurs at the end of the year, just like the big film of the year, and the filming period of the meteor shower can last from December 4th to December 17th.
This meteor shower is known for its large and stable flow, and together with the Quaternary meteor shower and the Aries meteor shower, it is known as the three largest meteor showers in the Northern Hemisphere.
A prominent feature of the Gemini shower is the slow, colorful meteor shower, which is suitable for both the naked eye and beginners in astronomical photography.
A meteor shower in the Gemini constellation was captured by astronomers in Tianjin, China, on December 13, 2020.
Astronomical forecasts indicate that this year's Gemini meteor shower will usher in a very large ZHR (the number of meteors that can be seen per hour when the radiation point is directly above the top of the head under ideal observation conditions) of 150 at about 15:00 on December 14.
The Gemini meteor shower is recommended.
Last year's Gemini meteor shower was impressive, but this year's Gemini meteor shower will be interrupted by the moonlight and will be a bit less spectacular.
The 14th day of the 11th month of the lunar calendar, the moon is convex, the bright moonlight will interfere with the observation, so in the later half of the night the moon will fall, at this time the radiation point of the Gemini meteor shower will also rise relatively high.
Friends who like meteor showers can observe in the late hours of the night when the moon is behind, but be careful to keep warm and cool.
How can we observe as many meteors as possible?
It is not advisable to observe in the city, but in the suburbs or in the countryside, choose a high altitude, low light, open view in the northeast direction, and wait patiently for the moon to fall to observe by eye.
It should be noted that the Gemini meteor shower has a large flow in all directions, so it is not necessary to constantly look at the radiation points of the Gemini meteor shower.
If you like photography and want to capture the beautiful meteor shower, it is best to choose a wide-angle camera with a large aperture, use high ISO and maximum aperture when shooting.
Based on stability and sustainability considerations, tripods, spare batteries and zip lines are also essential.
This is the first time I've ever seen a photo of a woman wearing a hijab, and I don't know what to make of it.
What is the difference between laser TV and conventional TV in terms of market positioning?
As I understand it, the traditional TV that the subject is referring to is the LCD TV, whereas the differences between the laser TV and the LCD TV in terms of market positioning are mainly due to the following two points:
First, laser TVs are more focused on the big screen market.
Compared to the full-fledged market positioning of LCD TVs, laser TVs are clearly more focused on the large screen market, or that laser TVs themselves are products for large screens.
Currently, the mainstream LCD TV size is 55 inches to 65 inches, while the size of the laser TV is generally more than 75 inches, and the maximum is more than 100 inches, which fully meets the needs of users for large-screen color electronics.
In recent years, the share of laser TVs in global shipments and sales has been increasing, accounting for more than 60% of the total TV sales of 80 inches and above.
The laser TV market is expected to grow by more than 140% in 2020 and continue to grow at a high rate, according to Zhongke's forecast.
The reason why the big screen market is doing so well is mainly due to the excellent performance of laser TVs in eye protection.
Based on the imaging principle of laser TV diffraction, the light emitted by the laser light source does not directly enter the eyeball. Compared to the backlight source of the LCD TV, the imaging process is closer to the imaging process of the object under natural conditions, and the stimulation to the eye is less.
Experts in ophthalmology from the Saisi Laboratory of the China Institute of Standardization of Electronic Technology and the Beijing Association of Hospitals, through rigorous comparison tests of laser TV and LCD TV viewing in the same conditions in a group of people, came up with 144 sets of test data.
The data confirms: Laser TVs do have strong eye protection properties, and in certain respects even have a certain improvement effect.
At a time when visual health is becoming more and more important, laser TV has not only attracted more and more users with its eye protection advantages, but also opened another breakthrough in the color electronics market.
Second, laser TVs are more focused on the high-end market.
In contrast to the declining price of LCD TVs, the price of laser TVs on the market today is mostly above 10,000 yuan, with the size and light source upgrading, the price is gradually rising.
Why are laser TVs so expensive?
There must be a reason for this.
With the continuous development of light sources and technology, laser TV has many advantages that LCD TV and projection cannot achieve.
With ultra-short focal length projection technology, the projection distance of laser TV is shorter than that of conventional projection equipment, can achieve a 100-inch large screen experience within a short distance, requires little space, and the host is small, taking up very little space.
In terms of brightness, major brand laser TVs can reach more than 2000 lumens.
In addition, less heat is generated, less equipment is lost, and the life of the TV is longer.
In addition, many high-end laser TV models are equipped with many cutting-edge technologies such as true 4K ultra-high-definition picture quality, artificial intelligence systems, and bionic screens, which can provide users with a more immersive audio-visual experience.
We can't talk about false demand, but the demand segmentation of the product, about the quality of the picture and the input output ratio, laser TV is not the dish of the video player, wanting to balance the big screen and the viewing environment is not enough, you can try, everything has advantages and disadvantages, weigh your own judgment after you can, be afraid to listen to one side of the word.
Simply put, ultra-wide-angle close-focus projectors - laser TVs, in order to get close to the screen, have to use expensive ultra-wide-angle lenses and reflectors, which are not in line with the best optical design.
In order to shield part of the ambient light, the use of microstructured Fennel curtains is expensive, the price of 80 inches is basically replaced by a 65-inch liquid crystal.
And one more thing, I especially hate the fact that the projector manufacturers are selling the fact that the reflection is good for the eyes, please, the light on the curtain that the eyes can see is the direct light for the eyes, you are reflected to the ceiling, and the eyes can not see it, unless the true liquid crystal TV is also a wandering direct light, and the TV ceiling is not illuminated?
And the projection canvas would be nothing if it weren't for the reflection.
It's just that the heat-spot effect of the high-benefit curtains is ignored, and a large amount of light is reflected into the eye from a certain angle, which is really unpleasant.
A selection of high-quality shops at the Museum of Visual and Aesthetic Photography. There are currently no shops.
With the appointment date on WeChat, she sent me the schedule she could choose, and I got back to her in a timely manner.
Before going to the store, I saw the photos of the outdoor wedding dress, which was very beautiful, and there were a lot of different styles of photography involved.
When the day came, I simply exchanged ideas with her, and she patiently helped me try on the two styles of clothes that I had wrapped, and finally decided to start the make-up - the photographer would put up some props, guide the movements, and be more meticulous about the details before shooting.
But maybe because they didn't share any specific photography ideas with me, it wasn't the style I wanted, but it should have looked good.
After the shoot, the photographer helps with the selection of the photos, exchanging ideas about the final style, and it feels very careful.
It takes about half a month to fix the film and wait for it to work.
For the second time in a row, most of the clothing in the photo-shooting section of the event was selected for a photo shoot.
Finally, choose a black dress to experience different styles.
The entire shooting process took about 2 hours, makeup + shooting, the photographer in charge of shooting is the brother after 95, feel a little or a little favored, hoping to give more advice to customers in the direction of filming the action later.
Photography and visual aesthetics in the gallery of the best quality shops Reply
It's on the front page, come see Queenie too!
To the store first filled in the name of the phone and then choose the clothes, the bride can choose, changed three or four sets of clothing is quite patient, after the selection of make-up for a long time, the service attitude is good, after the shooting will teach you how to model, is the feeling of the shot out of the face is very large, refinement is said to take half a month, three or four days to send, it feels like the original is no different
Overall, the environment is good.
There are many clothes to choose from.
There are almost three make-up locations, with a photo studio inside.
The waitresses were enthusiastic and attentive.
The stylists are very patient.
The photographer will teach you the moves very carefully.
If you are not satisfied, the photographer will take the initiative to ask for additional shots.
The original two eyelids have been replaced by three eyelids.
The eyebrows are also shaved, which is a little embarrassing for those who don't shave their eyebrows on a daily basis.
I've been taking pictures for 10 days, but I'm not satisfied with the result of the P-graph, and it's obvious that the eyelids are still sticking out.
I didn't know what style I wanted, so I tried on two suits, and I picked the one I wanted, and I chose the black dress.
The hairdresser and the make-up artist were very patient with me, and I was very happy with the results.
When I got my hair done, I started taking pictures, and the photographer was directing me through the whole process, and the process was smooth and smooth.
After the shoot, I carefully selected four of my favourite shots and polished them, and my brother said that he finished the film in 15 minutes, and I was very satisfied with the end result.
Since your system can't recognize my credit card, I can't join the #PRS_ORG# plus monthly plan!
The strangest thing is that I use the same credit card every time I make a payment.
I now have to pay for shipping every time.
Can I be excused until you have investigated and collected my monthly salary?
Is it safe to buy an umbrella?
The small umbrella is an online platform for insurance brokers.
To become an insurance broker, you must meet three key conditions: the shareholder, the founder has no major criminal record in the past 3 years, the minimum amount of 50 million yuan can be established, and the approval of the China Insurance Regulatory Commission.
These three are actually very demanding, in summary, to be strong, to be approved by the national authority of the Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (which regulates insurance companies and banks throughout the country), shareholders to have good manners, as an insurance brokerage company's small umbrella insurance, insurers do not need to question too much whether small umbrella insurance is legal or not, after all, there are these three thresholds, not every insurance company can reach.
On this point, it's still good, and trustworthy.
From the point of view of the insurance product: small umbrella insurance is an insurance supermarket, many companies' star serious illness insurance are sold on this platform, such as the latest and Thai Super Mary 5 serious illness insurance, the claimant and the underwriter are both Thai Life and Thai Life, small umbrella insurance is just a third-party intermediary, do not question its reliability.
From the payment model: the product of the Internet platform, because the operating costs of the business network points are less, and the cost of the salary of the business staff, so the general price of the Internet product is relatively high, and the payment method is flexible, supporting the monthly payment, reducing the payment pressure of the insurer, and at the same time maximizing the leverage of mobile insurance.
This is very good.
It's worth considering.
From the point of view of the professionalism of the employee: This is especially important, because insurance is an industry that requires a very strong professionalism, many customers of Internet products can insure themselves, this will be a lot of misunderstandings, in the health information and occupational area, non-insurance practitioners often add their own subjective awareness when insuring, feel that they are healthy or eligible, so there are many claims and risks that may be denied.
I myself have done insurance phone sales at Tencent Micro Insurance (which is also an online insurance brokerage platform) and I am very responsible to tell you that.
The insurance of the Internet is real, it is reliable, it is not reliable people, there are no professional practitioners in the Internet channel, and there is a lot of misleading sales.
These marketing strategies are not wrong, but they are lightweight, they do not tell the insurer that the first month is 1 yuan, the next month is required to pay the normal fee, dozens to 200 varies, many customers deduct the fee for one or two years to buy their own chicken is not clear.
The insurance company paid $6 million for the chance to spend $1.
Free mobile phones are sent only under special numbers such as 6666, 8888, and if a winning SMS is sent, it is not exchanged and no one is reminded.
(This is another pit for the insured person) Free 60 thousand serious illness insurance coverage is short-term, if only on this, there are no other commercial risks, in case of serious illness, what to do with 60 thousand, can not solve the problem, then life begins to run naked.
Currently, the government is cracking down on the misrepresentation of online insurance sales.
So overall, there is no problem with the platform, there is no problem with the product, there is a problem with the professionalism and professionalism of the staff.
In fact, many offline insurance brokers have a wider range of products, more opportunities and products for customers to choose from, and some products have a better price-performance ratio than Internet products.
I've personally helped 59 internet customers to insure their offline products, saving 2000-3000 yuan/year for each of them.
If you have any questions, feel free to communicate and exchange with me.
I: Mia Insurance Broker, have 3 years of experience in corporate management training, served nearly a thousand corporate users, cooperated with more than 100 insurance companies, before insuring, I will start from the customer's needs, customize insurance products for customers, insure, compare three for customers, try to get the best results for customers, after insuring, do the policy for customers to organize, policy custody, so that customers can be reassured.
Growing with each client for a lifetime.
Hopefully my answer will help with the topic!
According to the definition of the Insurance Regulatory Authority, Internet insurance is the insurance business in which the insured person can complete all the insurance processes independently after clicking on the insurance link.
During this process, neither the insured person nor the insurance advisor needs to sign, and all the steps can be completed by the insured person himself/herself.
Although there is not much ceremony in the coverage of Internet insurance, and there may not even be a paper contract in the printed version, this does not affect the validity and legal validity of the electronic version of the contract.
This model is somewhat similar to the waterline operation of a telephone vending machine in general, but there is a fatal problem with buying insurance in this way, which is that the subsequent service may not be able to keep up with it.
Insurance is usually a long-term contract that lasts for decades, and when we buy insurance, should we seriously think about whether the insurance broker we choose is someone who will be with us for a long time and will continue to provide services to us for many years to come?
So how do I get in touch with the catering commissioner?
It's almost 3:00.
Is that supposed to be compensation?
I said knock on the door and deliver.
But the rider gave it to the door, and the man left.
It's wrong.
Your riders have already taken a sale from me on #NUMBER#, but are still waiting to be notified.
The rider at 19:25 had received my takeout, but still refused to leave.
I'm going to finish it and see if I can sell the rest.
What can I do?
Where did your riders go?
Do we have to wait?
I'm going to send a bill.
Well, if you don't cancel, we'll call the police.
But my food has health and safety issues.

You can redeem the discount code.
No problem, remember no need to arrange a return, I already bought another one, I don't want to waste it.
Thank you for your help.
I have always been against any form of slander and name-calling, much less accepting such personal attacks.
In a civilized society, we can tolerate anything, but let's put an end to this scoundrel.
The first thing to be resisted, regardless of party or faction, is this uncivilized behaviour.
From when you started sending me Facebook friend requests, to when you started posting sarcastic posts, to when you tried to post my so-called home location and my father's name on social media, I have taken an unresponsive attitude.
Not only do you constantly tag me for six meals a day, but on Facebook you and your so-called friends continue to brazenly discuss some hidden and humiliating remarks about me, my appearance, body, well-being, and what kind of bed to plant strawberries on, or not to put, etc. I... also counted.
Later on, I also received comments from several friends about your Facebook friend page with a picture of you and sexual harassment content.
Sorry, as a girl, I can no longer remain silent.
After I uploaded the news about the police, you didn't stop at all, instead you became more and more angry.
I don't care what your political background is, I don't care what your status is, in our society, there is a need for respect between the sexes.
Yes, you can continue to make these humorous, hidden, humiliating, insulting remarks, you can continue to say that you just care and care about me, you can continue to think that this is not harassment, you can even continue to deny that you didn't make the picture or continue to make all the offensive remarks.
Yes, I can't, and I don't have the power to stop you.
I don't know you, and I don't want to know you, and I don't need you to judge me for my looks and my body.
I don't even think there is a girl who would be willing to be humiliated like that in exchange for fame.
My friend asked me, are you okay?
If I tell you, you won't believe me.
I don't think any girl can say she's okay after being bullied like that.
Only those who lack even the most basic virtues, whether in work, society, politics or business, would choose to hurt any woman in this way.
I believe that justice is in the heart.
I've edited out some of the comments for you to review.
No one should be able to impersonate you for your own posts.
I can only say that you are a public enemy of civilization.

Digital transformation involves the creation of databases for the protection and promotion of national cultural values, historical traditions, national heritage and humanity, and the promotion of digital transformation in areas such as banking, taxation, land management and development databases, and logistics.
The biggest goal of digital transformation is to make people happier and the country more prosperous.

Why the remake?

U.S. aircraft carriers are gathering around China One of the most powerful weapons in the U.S. Navy's arsenal is making a rare visit to Guam, sending an important signal to U.S. allies and adversaries in the Indo-Pacific.
On January 9, a satellite spotted the US aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson in the vicinity of the Strait of Malacca, according to the South China Sea Strategic Situational Awareness Platform, a Chinese think tank.
The Strait of Malacca connects the South China Sea and the Susquehanna Sea, and is a strategic point on the First Island chain in the western Pacific Ocean.
The platform is expected to be deployed in the South China Sea by the USS Duncan Vincent.
This was the first deployment of the aircraft carrier USS Duncan Vincent with F-35C fighters and CMV-22 shark tank transport aircraft.
The aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln, which departed from the United States on 3 January, is now floating in the Pacific Ocean in addition to USS Duncan Vincent.
USS Lincoln was also the first to carry an F-35C carrier squadron from the 314th Fighter Attack Squadron of the United States Marine Corps.
In addition to the two aircraft carriers mentioned above, the U.S. Navy currently deploys an aircraft carrier in the Asia-Pacific region, the USS Ronald Reagan, which is docked in Okinawa, Japan.
The carrier battle group also includes the cruiser HMS Penangplan, the guided missile destroyer HMS Stockdale, and other vessels.
U.S. aircraft carriers converge on China's most powerful weapon Rare visit to Guam January 17, 2022, The Strategic Situation Sensing Platform for the South China Sea released the latest satellite images showing three U.S. aircraft carriers converging on China.
U.S. aircraft carriers gather around China's most powerful weapons rare visit to Guam January 17, 2022, U.S. carrier-based transport aircraft CMV-22B flight route.
According to CNN, one of the most powerful weapons in the US Navy's arsenal made a rare visit to Guam over the weekend.
The Ohio-class nuclear submarine USS Nevada, carrying 20 Trident ballistic missiles and dozens of nuclear warheads, entered the U.S. naval base in Guam on Saturday.
A rare visit to Guam by the most powerful US aircraft carrier grouping around China sends a signal to both allies and adversaries amid growing tensions in the Indo-Pacific region, analysts say.
This was the first visit by a US ballistic missile submarine to Guam since 2016, and the second public visit to Guam since the 1980s.
In recent years, China has built a large number of military facilities in the Nanshan Islands.
An image of China's Ever Heat Island in the South China Sea.
(South Sea Research Forum) The U.S. Navy said in a statement that the visit of the Ohio-class nuclear submarine Nevada to Guam strengthened cooperation between the United States and its allies in the region and demonstrated the capabilities, flexibility, readiness, and continued commitment of the United States to security and stability in the Indo-Pacific region.
Ballistic missile submarines are often referred to as Boomer submarines.
The whereabouts of the 14 torpedo boats in the U.S. Navy's fleet are usually kept secret.
The secrecy surrounding ballistic missile submarines has made the Torpedo submarine hull the most important surviving weapon hull in the nuclear triad, which also includes ballistic missiles with launchers located on the U.S. mainland, as well as bombers capable of carrying nuclear warheads such as the B-2 and B-52.
Talking to a friend about the recent 26 percent drop in Meta, evaporating $251 billion in market value, Zuckerberg responded, "faced with unprecedented competition", and why?
Meta (originally Facebook) is essentially an advertising company whose revenue comes mainly from advertising, and the advertising companies that make money today are the traffic channels themselves.
Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, etc., regardless of their functional orientation, are the traffic channels of Meta.
Not only that, Meta is also the largest affiliate of Meta, and many apps outsource Meta's ads to Meta's advertising platform for monetization.
But times have changed.
First, because of Apple's privacy policy changes, it's difficult for Meta to access user data, which affects the effectiveness of its ad serving.
Apple's current privacy policy is user-friendly, and it's pretty obvious that if you allow an app to access your information, most people's normal response would be no.
If Google does it again, the impact on Meta's revenue will be even greater.
Second, the Chinese factor in Meta's previous revenue growth has also weakened (the percentage of this factor is uncertain, but it does exist).
It is common knowledge that Meta has no business in China, but this interpretation is inaccurate.
Every year, at least 10% of Meta's revenue comes from China, mainly contributed by companies that do maritime business in China.
Meta has about a hundred people in its Hong Kong office, as well as several large agents on the mainland.
Chinese companies want to expand their overseas markets, and Meta is an inescapable advertising channel, and most of the money they burn goes to Meta.
Interestingly, byte's TT is now one of Meta's main competitors, but Meta made a lot of money from byte in the first two years.
ByteDance's agents in China are advertising on Meta, and Meta's Greater China region is doing well.
I haven't done much research lately, but I'm sure it won't be better than before.
The era of large-scale money-burning by Chinese companies overseas is over.
Third, the development of new traffic channels has not gone smoothly.
Facebook is getting older, and new platforms, including TT, are out of Meta's hands.
The biggest problem is not just the decline in incomes, but the lack of growth expectations.
Capital markets don't just look at median income, but more importantly, what the future looks like.
Obviously, Meta's expectations are not enough.
In order to tell a new story to the market, Zuckerberg tells the story of the metaverse.
Metaverse should indeed be one of the directions of the future, but the metaverse has a long implementation cycle, and this story should not be enough to support Meta's market value in two or three years.
So the next two years should be the hardest for Meta.
Don't look at Facebook now, it's very glamorous, it's 100 to 200 billion dollars a year in revenue, it's actually very crisis-prone, and it doesn't have a very good firewall compared to other Internet companies and high-tech companies.
Although several of his social media apps are now more active and mainstream, such as Facebook, WhatsApp, etc., Facebook is not confident in the rapid growth of TikTok, and it is a blink of an eye between subversions.
And there is absolutely no hope of success in a short period of time with this promising and unattainable concept of the metaverse, so Facebook is very dangerous, which is the fundamental reason why Zuckerberg is changing the name of the company and is constantly looking for new tracks, but I feel that his choice of tracks is wrong, a road to no return above are some of my thoughts for reference.
