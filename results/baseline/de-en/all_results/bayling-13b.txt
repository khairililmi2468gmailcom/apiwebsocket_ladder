The item cost under 20 euros.
The fee is 40% of the value of the goods...
I am #PRS_ORG#'s wholesale customer, so it is not a problem for me.
I just need a number or instruction for which parcel I should use so that it can be tracked as a return with you.
I ordered the #PRS_ORG# a few days ago... for €249.
Today, it costs €179.
I find it honestly very annoying.
Do I have to cancel the order and reorder for a better price or is there another way to get a refund?
Fundamentally, I also think that children should not be expected to take on a parental role for their younger siblings.
However, I think that big brothers and sisters also benefit from being moderately concerned about the little ones.
Just have a quick look, just give a quick hand, just bring the bottle etc.
So they learn responsibility, help out at home and are included.
As long as they are still able to have enough children themselves, I don't see a problem with that.
If your K1 wants to be alone for a short time and it is okay for him, that is good.
You are best placed to judge whether it is suitable for your children.
It is not the case that he should wrap up K2 and keep it company for hours while it sleeps.
In all likelihood, it is legally dubious.
The psychologist's statement may therefore also be true.
As if something should actually happen like a fire, break-in, earthquake, alien invasion etc., it would actually be too much responsibility for K1 to look after K2.
Whether that is a risk you are willing to take is of course up to you ;)
Please help me find the title of a book!
I remember reading a crime/thriller a few years ago and I can still remember almost all of the plot but I just can't remember the title, does anyone know?
The history was about fear and how to treat it.
At the beginning of the story, an animal keeper commits suicide by covering himself in food and going into his enclosure with his predators.
The case is taken on by a detective who, after a short investigation, zeroes in on his therapist, who runs a clinic where he treats anxious patients.
The commissioner has a small niece who is also scared (of fire) and ends up with this therapist.
It will lead to more suicides and there is another protagonist - a photographer who is anonymously commissioned to go to the location of each suicide and document it and post the photos on the internet.
In any event, it turns out that this therapist was running some kind of underground therapy group where a chip was implanted in the patients' brains that suppressed their anxiety and the patients ultimately became extremely anxious.
(woman jumps out of a window, another does it on purpose to kill herself)
This fear is referred to in the book as "the fight."
There is a big showdown at the hospital that was on fire.
This is the rough plot I am pretty sure the book was written by a French author / authoress.
If this action is known to someone, or if someone even tells me the title of the book, I would be very pleased.
Oh dear, I don't have the wireless password.
Have to contact my husband first.
But that can take time.
What steps do I need to take?
Is it also possible to get the price difference refunded?
Child, 4 years old, splinter under the thumbnail
The kind four-year-old has splinters under their thumbnail (outside).
He tried to pull it out with a pair of pliers.
Very difficult to grasp.
That didn't work and it hurt.
Now, the child has a hysterical reaction if we try.
No chance.
Tomorrow I am seeing the doctor.

Due to Omikron, Johnson wants to drive ahead with a booster injection
New omega-3 cases worry politicians and scientists in the UK
As a result, all eligible adults in England should receive the vaccine by New Year.
London - In the light of the rapidly increasing omega figures, the British Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to move faster with the booster jabs for Coronavirus than was previously planned.
Every adult in England should have the opportunity to receive a booster dose by the end of the year, provided it has been at least three months since the second vaccine, Johnson said in a pre-recorded video message to his countrymen on Sunday evening.
Thus far, the deadline has been set for the end of January.
The UK Government will provide additional support to ensure vaccination campaigns are accelerated across Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
Faced with the omicron variant, we are in a state of emergency, and therefore the vaccine must be strengthened as a matter of urgency, Johnson said.
The good news is that a third dose may be able to restore protection.
Now, let's get this done," Johnson said.
On Sunday, 1,239 further cases of the omega strain were recorded in the UK, taking the total to 3,137.
This was an increase of a full 65 percent compared to the previous day.

I am in favor of everyone introducing themselves with pronouns
I have sent off an application.
The invitation to a talk came by email today.
I want to respond to the email.
Alas, the name is not "Peter", but a somewhat more complicated name.
I have looked it up and depending on where he/she has a cultural background is either a man or a woman.
I have no idea how to write this email.
Can someone please help me?
I am a foreigner and I don't want to step on any bureaucrats' toes either.
Conclusion: everyone should get to know pronouns.
I have a total of 5 books there.
Four of them are going.
Only one that I bought today doesn't work
Obviously the chair had an unapparent fault with it when it was sold.
How can such a mattress defect occur after 9 months otherwise?
First on #PRS_ORG.
But that has been the case for about
Not 14 days.
So I've been buying the last few books through the website and then reading them on the #PRS_ORG#.
I bought 6 #PRS_ORG# but wanted to buy 8.
There weren't any.
Now they are back in stock and I want to please add 2 chairs to your order and charge you for that.
[CW] The feeling of not being able to help.
Content warning: I will write something about domestic violence here.
I have to write something from the heart.
I (21) often come into contact with victims (and perpetrators) of domestic violence for professional reasons.
One topic that does trouble me and, sadly, crops up all too frequently, is that many victims do not come forward or think that we cannot help them.
It is perfectly clear to me that we cannot do everything and that it is not perfect.
But there are few things that move me more in my job than being able to do something in situations like that.
I see the blue patches, the blood, the despairing eyes...
But even in a one-to-one conversation, when the perpetrator is out of sight and earshot, I cannot reach everyone.
I don't know why, maybe it's fear, fear of revenge, fear of leaving the familiar social environment, fear of snatching the children from it.
What I always try to make clear, and which is also very close to tears, is that it is worth living without violence for everyone.
I want women to know they don't have to simply accept the violence.
Often I wish I could help... I know I can't.
But it will never be easy.
Please, always remember, you are worth living without violence, that is so incredibly important.
Arcane on Netflix: What does the series have in common with "League of Legends"?
Lots of fantasy, complicated names, breathtaking production: "Arcane", the series set in the "League of Legends" computer game universe, has recently started on Netflix.
Why are we looking forward to the already announced second series?
Basketball Bundesliga: Derby disaster for MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg at Merlins Crailsheim
At least young Johannes Patrick could be relied upon.
Nothing again: for the second time within not even three months, the giants lost in Crailsheim - and how!
Prior to the game, Ludwigsburg's coach, John Patrick, looking back to the cup defeat at the beginning of October against Hakro Merlins Crailsheim, said: "We've still got a bit of anger in our bellies".
But they didn't lie down after the game - instead, they raised their game in the face of the 61:72 (28:38) defeat in the basketball Bundesliga.
And it was more than just the bare result that was disappointing about the performance.
Representative is a statistic that expresses the entire problem: the treble quote was just 13 percent, four goals (all by young Johannes Patrick) and 31 attempts - any questions?
The response from John Patrick was: "We were simply not concentrated enough after winning at Tenerife and did not do what we had trained for".
Specifically to move the ball.
His opposite number, Sebastian Gleim, had a different reaction: "It's great to win this fantastic game against Ludwigsburg for the second time," said the happy coach.
It felt like 10,000 people.
On Saturday, just 750 visitors were allowed into the Hohenlohe Arena, but they had to pay for the privilege.
This is also thanks to BBL top scorer T.J. Shorts, who scored 22 points and controlled the game for his team.
The best playmaker I have ever trained, Gleim praised.
Meanwhile, in Patrick's team, even the top performers like Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7) let the side down.
The giants prevented a total disaster in the last quarter (10.15pm) when they came back to within eight points, after they had been 39-59 behind.
Alongside Johannes Patrick, Justin Simon managed twelve points.
There is fortunately not much time for arguing.
On Wednesday (7 p.m.) the giants are already receiving Skyliners Frankfurt, then also in Ludwigsburg, in front of a maximum of 750 spectators.
We used to have another email address, but I changed it.
Yes, I registered a few months ago.
All claims for compensation were unfortunately rejected.
We have taken legal advice and have written to them again.
We signed up originally six months ago.
Still as always: Max Raabe turns 59
He is able to enthuse his audience with new interpretations of hits from the 20s and 30s.
Currently he is touring with the programme "A lovely day" - if he is allowed to perform.
Max Raabe had actually wanted to celebrate his birthday on stage in Leipzig this Sunday.
But nothing comes of it.
The planned concert has now been postponed until May 2022 - "at the request of the authorities" to help combat the Coronavirus.
Other planned appearances during Advent must first be postponed, as it says on the website of the singer, who turns 59 today, and his musicians (www.palast-orchester.de).
From January, the artists want to make up for the dates they had to postpone in 2020 due to the pandemic.
Born on 12 December 1962 in Lünen in North Rhine-Westphalia, Max Raabe sang a lot and loved to sing as a youth.
In Berlin he studied opera singing and in 1986 he founded the Palace Orchestra with his fellow students.
Since then the baritone has made a name for himself with his repertoire of hits and songs in the style of the Comedian Harmonists.
It has won multiple awards.
His live album from the "MTV Unplugged" series (2019) reached - just like his successful album "Für Frauen ist das kein Problem" (2013) - second place in the charts.
He dragged it out of the niche and into the mainstream.
Always impeccably dressed, with his blond hair slicked back and mindful of etiquette, Max Raabe is no longer unforgettable in the current German-speaking music scene.
He has been touring with the programme "Good day, dear luck" since 2020.
Hello #NAME#, is it also possible to get a small sample of the furniture wood in advance?

It still doesn't work. I can only see the cover page but cannot turn the page.
Federal building minister Klara Geywitz: No new homes are created through expropriation
The new Federal Building Minister Klara Geywitz (SPD) has spoken out against the expropriation of large housing companies, as has been demanded in a Berlin referendum.
With a compulsory purchase no new homes are created, only the ownership structure changes, said Geywitz in an interview with the "Tagesspiegel" (Sunday).
My goal is to give tenants certainty that their rent will be affordable over the next few years.
A diverse mix of, for example, private landlords, cooperatives or housing companies, is incidentally the best protection against a monopoly forming.
The coalition of SPD, the Greens and the Left party in Berlin is going to set up an expert committee to work out how to handle the outcome of the referendum.
However, if the situation does not improve, Geywitz will not rule out talks with the FDP in the ruling coalition about tightening up tenancy law.
The coalition agreement provides for a rent brake until 2029, limits on rent increases in strained housing markets and the extension of the rent mirror.
I will speak to the justice minister to implement this as quickly as possible.
If the rental market doesn't improve, "we will discuss further steps with our coalition partners," stressed the SPD politician.
Hello, I wanted to place an order and a couple of days later it occurred to me that I had forgotten the final step of payment.
Sadly, the product is no longer available.
Do they know when it will be in stock again?
Or is it even going to happen again?

At Least 100 Dead From Tornadoes In Kentucky
A devastating storm system has unleashed numerous tornadoes across the US.
In Kentucky alone, more than 100 deaths could be attributed to the storm.
The pictures from there remind one of a war zone.
On Friday night multiple tornadoes tore through the US causing heavy damage and potentially hundreds of fatalities.
The storms left a roughly 320-mile path of destruction, especially in the state of Kentucky.
Governor Andy Beshear said after a visit to the disaster zone that everywhere the tornado had ripped through, everything was gone.
Houses, shops, government buildings - just gone.
Pieces of industrial equipment, tops are in the trees.
It is hard to imagine that this is even possible.
It is alone expecting up to a hundred dead in the state of Kentucky, and the official figures are rising constantly.
Hello, I have just seen that vitrine #NAME# is sold out.
That is very bad.
Is it still being made?
Or have they been completely removed from the range?
Is it possible to order this cabinet in another country?
How long before you report yourself?
If delivery cannot be made to my apartment, I have to cancel the order!
I understand, I can order the blanket now and have it delivered to Germany, can't I?
I had replied to the contact form or abandoned it and wanted to inquire whether it had arrived or was being processed, as I had not received any confirmation yet.
Companies are paying out vaccine bonuses and changing slogans
While the German government continues to reject proposals for a vaccination bonus, companies in Austria have taken the initiative themselves and are offering their employees money for being vaccinated.
This puts them on a line with the social partners ÖGB and Wirtschaftskammer, who today called for financial incentives to get vaccinated.
The reworking of advertising slogans into calls for vaccinations - following the German example - should increase readiness for vaccinations.
He moved to a different company, over which he grumbled.
That doesn't make his situation any better than yours.
Wait and drink tea.
A year has passed.
He openly didn't stick to his old place and sought something else.
You should too.
And that he didn't like you back then: naja, whatever.
And he didn't like his job either.
There are too many variables at play.
Please cancel the booking.
That will then be legally relevant.
I make a screen-shot.

Help with first own campaigns
Hello!
I am currently preparing an adventure Over the Grim Pass for a group of four friends and want to lead my heroes seamlessly into a campaign specifically written for players.
We are playing DSA 5.
The big picture is there, the baddies and their motives written, individual scenes imagined, and now I'm coming to write the opening adventure and I'm stumbling over my own feet.
The premise is that the heroes are meant to deliver a cartload of grain from Gratenfels to a small village near Lake Thuran.
And further action should develop from there.
A mile or so from the village, the heroes are waylaid by a group of goblins and lured into an ambush.
I want to give player characters the possibility of resolving confrontations in various ways: through persuasion, action, threat, danger detection at an early stage - whatever seems most appropriate for the players.
Group strength: 8 common goblins, 2 with spears, 6 with bows and sabres armed.
If they are not noticed, the goblins lurk in a hollow way and flank the hero, armed with bows, three to the left and three to the right, while two stop the cart with spears.
If it comes to battle and the heroes are defeated, I have two solutions
The heroes are all knocked out, and are then found and healed by the village schoolmaster's son, a half-elf.
The trolley is of course gone.
If there is an inevitable defeat, this half-elf and two of his knights will jump in and help the hero in the fight.
The trolley is still there, everything is super.
How do you account for your Deus ex Machina solution 2?
Is the Encounter too much of an introduction to the adventure?
The group of goblins will later play a crucial role, so it's not just cannon fodder.
EDIT: wow, I had not expected so many answers, above all not with so many great suggestions and tips.
I will definitely incorporate many of your ideas and I now also have more confidence in my storytelling.
I took the lamp apart again.
And they're at it again.
Unfortunately, it still doesn't work.
This is why I would still like to send them back
Can you then send the invoices, then I can pack the lamps and bring them to #PRS_ORG#.

Will everything be loaded again or just the loading space?
I am fed up with Sky Sport F1
Hello dear F1 fans, over the season the quality on German Sky has got worse and worse, so I want to give this post a little air.
First of all, during the F2 race, the transmission was interrupted so that the F1 build-up could begin on time.
Although the schedule was far behind due to the delayed start and the crash at the beginning, it would have been possible to show the last (planned) ten minutes and the championship decision (!) nevertheless.
But apparently it is the case that, for legal reasons, F1 takes priority and everything else has to fit in around it, so Sky DE had no choice.
Still daft though, especially as Sky UK had the race covered.
Even a small amount of praise: commentator Olivier Zwartyes has accompanied the difficult situation surrounding the serious accident well.
Then there was a lack of knowledge of the rules in F1 when commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher did not know that it is allowed to change tyres under a red flag.
Although this situation had arisen in Imola, Baku and Silverstone this year, it was not until there were relevant messages to Hamilton on the subject that both drivers agreed Verstappen should be allowed to change tyres.
Both commentators on Sky UK and RTL knew immediately that this was a possibility for Verstappen.
I think you should just know these basic rules if you're commentating on F1 for a pay-TV channel.
It's also not the first mystery that now, according to the rules, is possible or prescribed, both have simple constant uncertainties about the subject of the rules.
Generally Roos's artificial commentary style does not appeal to him, but he does admit that it is a matter of taste.
But seriously, I even prefer Heiko Wasser from RTL.
This is in addition to constant tomfoolery, which simply makes both of them come across as unprofessional, such as getting a coffee with (equally clueless) reporter Peter Hardenacke or "UuuuuHD" from Ralf Schumacher.
The latter in particular has caused a great deal of unrest in the comments, which he clearly does not take seriously.
Not least, the advertising simply takes over at Sky, in the final round Sky is the only broadcaster that goes into advertising, as one can listen to on F1TV, where only the German soundtrack without commentary can follow the race directly after the race.
Neither ServusTV nor the ORF do that.
These two channels also make less advertising in the training than Sky, and that as a free-to-air broadcaster.
One must praise Glock and Baumgartner for their work, but that alone is not enough for me to overlook the disadvantages.
The rest of the Sky Sport F1 programming is also very poor and full of repeats.
All in all, Sky is really the worst German-speaking transmitter of the F1.
Ironically, RTL is doing a better job on the four races they are still allowed to broadcast, apart from the advertising.
So, in any case, the grandiose F1 season makes a lot less fun than it would be with a reasonable sender.
I would really like to hear your opinion.
Here: #PRS_ORG# pendulum light, brass and more coloured glass x 1
Hello, I have an article that was due last week and still hasn't been delivered.
I've contacted the chat twice now and haven't heard anything back.
The First Lady told me it would be sent on Monday, the Second Lady told me she would check and send an email and never responded.
Hello, I ordered two #PRS_ORG# on 12.12.19.
One of these has already shown defects (the material has a hole at the front section of the seat).
I'm asking for support.
Air pumps are ideal for additionally providing oxygen to an aquarium.
It is also possible to operate a filter system using a pump.
We offer this series in three versions.
Check out the table at the end of the offer.
This is where you can compare the services.
If the pumps are powerful enough, you can run the entire system with them.
If you have a large aquarium, pumps with 2 or more outlets are suitable, so that you can connect more water outlets.
The MK series has one, two or four outlets, depending on the model of the ventilation pump, but in order to highlight the aquarium, for example, with an air curtain (which can be found in our shop), or with a decoration that converts the air bubbles into a function.
Here one could mention a treasure chest, a mussel or the like.
The MK series has a special, sound-insulated construction, which means low operating noise.
The installation is very simple.
The fan pump is connected to an extractor via an air hose 4/6 mm...and it's ready to go.
The fan pump should either be at the same level, or higher than the water level, and installed outside.
If the fan pump is deeper than the water level, you should put a check valve in between.
Just cut the air hose and put the valve in between.
This would prevent it, if the water were to run backwards, that the water from the basin flows through the pump...
If the fan pump is to be placed outside, then, like other air pumps, it should be covered and protected from moisture
The MK series pumps are pure power packages that consume little energy
Even though we state a processing time of 3 days on eBay, we deal with it every day and the parcels are collected every day.
Things are going well, it's going very quickly.
We just wanted to avoid anyone being upset, just because it took a little longer.
That's how it is, not everyone has understanding for all the staff that also work in the forwarding business...of course the Corona virus doesn't stop here.
Please don't immediately assume the worst, it's just that delivery is delayed, that's down to the postal service.
Of course one mocks these services, even though we are saying at the moment... they have it damn hard
This is also very different regionally.
Don't be angry with anyone, stay healthy and we all hope that better times will come again.
How long does it take the yellows to order with and without armrests?
Can we also order the legs in a lighter shade?
Amazon founder Bezos sends astronaut's daughter and moderator into space
The daughter of the first American in space, a TV presenter and four other passengers have taken a short trip into space.
They were carried aloft by the "New Shepard" rocket system from Blue Origin, founded by Amazon boss Jeff Bezos.
The roughly ten-minute flight took place in the western part of the US state of Texas.
Under a bright blue sky, Bezos warmly welcomed the freshly-minted astronauts upon their return.
Welcome back," Bezos said, wearing a blue flight suit, as he opened the hatch to the capsule.
The six passengers climbed out one by one to cheers from friends, family and co-workers at Blue Origin.
According to Blue Origin, they were airborne for 10 minutes and 13 seconds, reaching an altitude of 107 kilometers.
Seventy-four-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, the daughter of Alan Shepard, who became the first American to fly in space in 1961 as a NASA astronaut, and after whom Blue Origin's rocket system is named, and 50-year-old TV host Michael Strahan were among the company's paying passengers, along with space engineering consultant Dylan Taylor, investor Evan Dick, technology entrepreneur Lane Bess and his son Cameron.
How much each paid for their tickets Blue Origin did not say.
Laura Shepard Churchley recalled the mission her father undertook after the short flight.
He had to work hard and do everything for himself when he was out there.
The 74-year-old said she simply went along with it, laughing.
Michael Strahan was also full of praise.
The presenter said he would love to go back into space immediately.
New Shepard flies to 100 kilometers in height
The "New Shepard" rocket system flies largely automatically.
The capsule separated from the rocket during flight and reached an altitude of around 100 kilometres above the Earth, occasionally experiencing weightlessness, before the reusable object was slowed by large parachutes and landed.
The International Civil Aviation Organization and many other experts consider 100 kilometers above the Earth to be the line between airspace and space, but there is no binding international regulation.
It was already Blue Origin's third manned space flight: The first in July had Amazon founder Bezos on board with his brother, a former US pilot aged 82, and an 18-year-old Dutchman.
The second, in October, was attended by 90-year-old Canadian actor William Shatner, who became a household name as "Captain Kirk" in Star Trek, as well as former Nasa engineer Chris Boshuizen, entrepreneur Glen de Vries and Blue Origin vice president Audrey Powers.
Critics say Bezos and Blue Origin are generally pushing the business of space tourism forward with little regard for the greater good of humanity or the climate.
With the touch of a button, you can simply choose whether your "smart stone" should permanently light up in one colour or whether it should play through its entire colour spectrum.
Once the color is changed, the pigment will hold the light color for around one minute before gently transitioning to the next decorative color.
The solid construction of the "Smart Stone" light means it can be left outdoors all year round.

Someone who works or studies biochemistry
I am currently studying first semester biochemistry and I find the subject matter itself quite interesting and I am not at all disturbed by the lab work (I have already completed an inorganic chemistry practical).
Of course I also inform myself about career prospects before my studies, but at that time I also thought that I would certainly study until a doctorate and work in research.
At the moment, however, I have doubts, especially about my future career.
On the one hand (Studycheck etc), one always hears of fantastic job opportunities and the profession is totally in demand, on the other hand, one always hears of unemployed biologists and appallingly poorly paid positions.
Therefore, I would really be interested:
1) What are they working on at the moment?
Are you satisfied with your work/salary?
3) What have you studied/What training have you had?
4) Would you do it all again?
Thank you for your answers!
I am currently really unsure and am considering leaving my studies in 2022 to do a training course to become a qualified IT specialist.
If you have experience in this field, please do share!
Extra stress before holidays and weekends
This came up for me last week.
However, I now had to use my long weekend to unwind.
So, now, finally, a post about it.
It's not just before major holidays like Christmas that there's a lot of stress in our company.
As it seems, this is also the case on holiday plus bridge days.
In fact, last week was the feast of the Assumption, known to us in Switzerland as "Auffahrt".
On Friday, most people and businesses take a bridging day, which is semi-official.
So a long 4-day weekend was on the cards last week.
What was going on last week?
Everywhere stress.
Loads of emails that had to be sent before getting on the road, jobs here, jobs there, everything *absolutely* before the long weekend.
Because... yes, because?
Because "next week then" after all that time doesn't sound right?
Or because people seriously want to achieve in a short week as much as they would in a normal one?
Not only was I stressed on Wednesday, but I was also mightily irritated.
What is the purpose of this self-imposed holiday?
Why do we then have holidays, if we are not allowed to celebrate them properly?!
The stress did not come from on high, his colleagues were all perfectly capable of dealing with it.
My question is simply this: Are we the Swiss the only ones like this?
Is that our reformed-evangelical way?
Or do you know that in the North too?
Yvonne Catterfeld is looking forward to Christmas in Thuringia
Yvonne Catterfeld (42) is looking forward to Christmas in her native Thuringia - but hasn't got any presents yet.
The beauty of it is, even if there is no snow in Erfurt, one simply goes to Ilmenau in the Thuringian Forest," said the actress and singer on Hit Radio FFH.
She will agree to the festival by baking little cakes and playing with her son.
I love it, said Catterfeld.
However, she still has some things to do before the contemplative days: "Firstly, I haven't got any presents yet - I really must get started".
NEKTON-Bio supports the smooth running of the moulting and feather regeneration.
NEKTON-Bio contains all essential vitamins, amino acids, minerals, trace elements and 200,000 µg of biotin/kg.
NEKTON-Bio gives the bird a smooth and shiny plumage.
The majority of feather damage in poultry farming is exclusively the result of nutritional errors.
Since the plumage is made of proteinaceous substance, a particularly rich and balanced diet containing protein is a prerequisite for the formation of a fault-free feather covering.
In order for the metabolism to work properly, daily food must contain sufficient amounts of vitamins, minerals and trace elements.
The majority of animal losses that occur during the moulting period are due to inadequate or excessive protein intake and/or insufficient supply of vitamins and minerals.
The unfavourable ratio of amino acids in most plant-based foods is taken into account explicitly and balanced in the composition of NEKTON-Bio.
While being given NEKTON-Bio no further vitamin preparations should be administered.
NEKTON-Bio is water-soluble and can simply be administered via drinking water or soft feed.
Many thanks, I found it.
Unfortunately, it still doesn't work
DDR-Handarbeitsmodel Altbau E-Lok E 95 03 DRG/ DR, the loco was in service in Silesia and Central Germany, this very rare loco probably originates from the reconstruction proposal of the Model Railway Enthusiast ME Heft 11/1968, see photos, the function is good, The Baureihe E 95 is a heavy goods train electric loco of the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft (DRG), it was designed for traction of heavy coal trains in the Silesian network, possibly the kit also comes from the small-scale firm ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMA
A locomotive is in the DB Museum in Halle (Saale) and we have restored it to working order.
In 1924, the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft commissioned AEG to draw up proposals for an electric locomotive that should be able to haul 2,200-tonne freight trains and 530-tonne passenger trains along this line at a speed of 45 km/h.
A maximum speed of 65 km/h was required.
Thus, in March 1926, DRG commissioned the delivery of a 1'Co+Co1' locomotive with AEG Tatzlager drive and the delivery of the mechanical parts by Siemens-Schuckertwerke with the electrical parts.
Between December 1927 and June 1928, six locomotives were delivered, which received the operating numbers E 95 01 to 06.
All survived the Second World War and found themselves again in the territory of the later GDR.
In 1946, the locomotives were delivered to the Soviet Union as reparations.
They returned to Germany by November 1952.
The suitability for restoration of all six locomotives was established in the German Federal Railways repair works in Dessau.
With the progressive electrification of the Central German network, there was an increasing need for locomotives for heavy goods services, and in 1959, the three locomotives E 95 01 to E 95 03 were modernised, with the other machines being used as sources of spare parts.
First preference was given to the large quantities of E 04, E 44 and E 94 that were available.
It was only when it became clear that the processing number for the E 94 would not be increased that the E 95 came into view as the processing number to be increased.
The locomotives were initially stationed in the Leipzig Wahren railway works.
In 1960 they came to the Halle P railway works.
They were used in a dedicated timetable, mostly hauling coal from the Geiseltal to Halle, Leipzig and Erfurt.
With increasing age, the complicated control of the locomotives proved to be a problem.
It was not uncommon for gunmen to remain stuck to their actions.
The companion, who was always on the train, had to use a hammer and crowbar to uncouple the gunner during the journey.
Damage to traction motors was frequent and led to months-long outages for the locomotive.
By the end of the 1960s, there were enough new-build diesel locos in stock and the electrified network was not planned to expand significantly at that time, so the Deutsche Bahn could dispense with old locos and most of the branch lines, so that the E95 was taken out of service.
In addition, the Deutsche Bahn wanted to operate the electric locomotives with just one crew member, which would have posed a problem with regard to the difficulties with the machines and the lines of sight from the driver's cab.
In the middle of 1969, E 95 02 and E 95 03 were decommissioned, followed by E 95 01, which retired on 5 October 1970.
The planned new designation 255 001 was never used.
All the locomotives were taken apart, except for E 95 02.
E 95 02 was set up in the main station in Halle as a welded rail heating system to replace the future museum locomotive E 77 10.
Some time passed before those responsible at the railway company could be convinced that E95 should be preserved as a museum locomotive.
In 1979, initial external work on the locomotive began, with the goal of presenting it as a vehicle at a show in RAW Dessau.
Since then, it has been part of the Dresden Transport Museum as a non-operational museum locomotive.
In 1986, the internal completion of the locomotive was carried out.
The locomotive is looked after in the DB Museum in Halle (Saale).
Since 1995, employees of the traditional community of Halle P have been working on the operational readiness of the locomotive.
In April 2015, the loco could be exhibited in the Museum-Bw Arnstadt for the first time with a new internal and external livery, with the transformers having been checked and five motors being operational.
The locomotives were in service on the Silesian Mountain Railway and the branch lines until 1945, where they proved themselves on the basis of their reliable drive and low maintenance costs.
In February 1945 the machines were moved to Leipzig, to be incorporated into the Central German network.
The main area of operation was initially Silesia
Handicraft model H0 in OVP, functioning well, optical finishing work on the loco in your own time needed, greased, with tracks, cellar smell (!!), very rare handicraft model, very small edition - possibly the building kit also comes from the small-series firm ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN.
The packaging may show labels and storage marks.
Yes they are
I got a bed from you.
However, there were problems with one part.
The central beam is held up by two feet...unfortunately, these are too narrow and the beam cannot be mounted on the feet.
What are we doing now?
I can't put the bed together.
The central beam is supported by two feet, which are unfortunately faultily produced.
The central beam does not fit into the planned support.
So I get new ones sent to me.
When will they be despatched?
no not shallow.
According to the assembly instructions these are the correct ones, they were just too narrow
But that is irrelevant.
The main this is that they fulfil their purpose
They are not shallow with me
Could I receive a copy of this?
Hello #NAME#, should I explain the problem to you again?
House fire with two minor injuries and significant damage
Two people were slightly injured in a fire in a house in Upper Bavaria.
In addition, an estimated €600,000 worth of damage was caused, according to police on Sunday.
The fire seems to have spread from a carport into the adjacent house in Kinsau (Landsberg am Lech district).
According to that source, two residents were taken to hospital on Sunday with mild smoke poisoning.
The precise cause of the fire was initially unknown, but the police did not consider the fire to have been deliberately set.
The Criminal Investigation Department at Fürstenfeldbruck has taken on the further investigation.
But that comes much later
And I've got to pay postage again
To debunk fake news - biotech CEO publishes vaccine photo
Ugur Sahin published a photo of his first vaccination in early 2021 on the social network "LinkedIn".
BioTech Chief Uğur Şahin has thus far not made any public statement about his vaccination status.
The entrepreneur has now published a photo showing his coronavirus vaccination.
The illness of a friend was the reason for this, shared Şahin.
The CEO and co-founder of the German company Biontech, Uğur Şahin, published a photo showing him receiving a vaccine against the coronavirus.
There were false reports on social media that I was not vaccinated.
In fact, my wife and I have been given three doses of the Biontech-Pfizer vaccine," Sahin wrote on Friday in a post on the networking site LinkedIn.
For months, friends have been urging me to post a photo of myself getting a vaccine to counter the false rumors.
Thus far he has refused because the communication should not revolve around himself.
But a call last week changed his mind: "I was deeply upset to learn that one of my old school friends is currently fighting for his life.
He is fighting a severe Covid-19 illness and has been on a ventilator for three weeks.
His schoolfriend and his family were not vaccinated," Şahin continued.
He said he did not ask for reasons.
However, the most common cause seems to be anxiety, stoked by misinformation and mistrust.
Anxiety is difficult to combat with facts, sometimes it is better to share personal experiences.
An interview with German Welle is circulating on the internet in which Uğur Şahin says he has not been vaccinated.
However, the video was created in December 2020, as Deutsche Welle itself clarified.
At the moment it is not legal for me to have the vaccine myself, Şahin said back then.
There is prioritisation in the vaccination in Germany.
Meanwhile the priority has long been lifted – and according to his own statements, the head of the biotech company has had himself injected three times.
Fire in substation: tens of thousands of people without power
In several municipalities in North Rhine-Westphalia, the lights went out on Friday evening: no power and in many cases probably no heating either.
A fire had disabled a substation.
After a fire caused severe damage to a substation, tens of thousands of people in the Rhein-Sieg-Kreis in North Rhine-Westphalia were without power for around 24 hours.
As a result of the fire, the lights went out for 41,000 affected residents and inhabitants in several municipalities on Friday evening.
Power supplier Westnet reported that numerous emergency power supplies were in operation until the widespread disruption was finally completely resolved late at night.
Fire service people and helpers and helpers from the German Technical Relief Organisation (THW) provided support in the communities.
Authorities were providing places for children to stay in schools and appealing for neighborhood help.
The caterer thanked those affected for their patience and the helpers for their efforts.
We are very conscious that the last 24 hours have brought significant restrictions.
We also thank the affected municipalities, the district, the fire services and the German Technical Relief organisation for their tireless efforts," the head of the primary technology division, Florian Witt, said in an announcement on Saturday evening.
Repairing the damage will take a few more days, as the Westnet engineers were initially only able to restore some cables provisionally, he explained.
A technical fault led to the fire, according to company information.
The water flows again
According to Westnetz, the fire that broke out on Friday at around 7.15pm heavily damaged parts of the 10,000-volt switchgear in the Neunkirchen-Seelscheid substation.
Expensive cleaning and repair works are necessary there.
A connection to a 30,000-volt level has been developed parallel to this.
With the help of this bypass, power supply will be restored.
Electricity has been restored to over 21,000 people in Much and Ruppichteroth since 6pm on Saturday.
An additional 20,000 residents of Neunkirchen-Seelscheid were gradually reconnected from 9.30 p.m.
Electricity was restored at 11.15 p.m. to those last affected by the outage.
More than 80 network engineers from Westnet and partner companies were involved.
The authorities had also called for help from neighbours on Saturday afternoon, following the setting up of emergency power supplies for important buildings.
It is important now that citizens look after older or lonely people in their neighbourhoods and let their local fire station know if they need help, explained District Administrator Sebastian Schuster (CDU) after a crisis meeting.
In setting up and operating emergency power systems, the main focus was on residents of old people's homes.
In addition, according to authorities, temporary care places have been set up in schools for people who cannot cope without help or who require electricity-dependent medical devices or medical care.
Hello!
Unfortunately, the roof is sold out in Germany.
Can I buy it from you and pay in euros?
It is the daily cover #PRS_ORG# in blue-green.
I hope you are having a lovely day and please stay healthy ♡
However, I cannot mount the stand on the tabletop.
It is custom #NAME#.
There are three versions of this.
We wanted tables with a diameter of #NUMBER#
This gave us a diameter of 155cm.
Today my #PRS_ORG# arrived, but I can't cram it and thus shorten it.
Can you help me with that?
Otherwise I would have to send them back, as they are not suitable for the purpose.
I would be delighted to receive feedback
and that is really easy!
Well, we can do that!
Can you send me the return receipt by email?
The repairs are now complete.
I had already tried this before the chat.
Before the purchase I had not restarted the e-#PRS_ORG#.
Should I do it now?
I find such a low discount almost cheeky.
We do not agree with this
Nordic Combined: Combiner Riiber wins
German Nordic combined athletes Fabian Rießle and Julian Schmid sprinted to the podium at the World Cup in Otepää, Estonia.
The duo had to give way once again to the outstanding Norwegian Jarl Magnus Riiber, who had taken a large lead after the ski jumping.
Please return the order number #NUMBER#.
When will the money be credited back to my account?
Yes we have both done this and use version 4.5...
It could be that they have already heard the problem many times
I bought a book with my #PRS_ORG#, it seems to be on there.
When I try to open it comes the message, oh dear!
The document could not be opened.
If you encounter any issues, they may be reported to customer services.
As far as I can tell it is a #PRS_ORG# epub file.
Can you help me further?
The chat connection is lost and now?
I also have to work in the meantime!
So that the paint job is even and clean, you should clean the parts with a little soapy water to remove dust, grease and fingerprints, rinse them with clear water and dry them.
Before you put brush to canvas for the first time with a new color, it's a good idea to do 2 to 3 strokes.
You can do it on the invisible inside of the component or on a yoghurt pot.
First mark on the component
Draw the brush smoothly, stroke for stroke.
A slight overlap of the colour layers later produces an even surface.
Avoid quickly going back and forth with the brush.
This leads to the creation of unrealistic surfaces.
A model is not a garden fence.
Start with bright colors.
The dark ones could otherwise shine through later.
Metallic tones and colors come to an end with a separate brush.
Otherwise it can come to unsightly metal layers if they mix with normal paints.
Let the painted parts dry for a day before you varnish them.
The models achieve an authentic appearance through the decals or stickers.
From flags on aircraft to ship's names, to stripes and number plates on car models: the decals are the final touch for the model.
Apply the decals in the correct order while you can still access the parts.
A plane cockpit can be/easily glued into place before being fitted into the body.
More important than the right tools, such as scissors, pliers and a toothpick, is the amount of glue, patience and a steady hand when sticking.
Cut each required decal out individually and lay them down for you.
Decals are also known as water transfer images because you briefly moisten the reverse with water so that the carrier paper goes dark through the moisture.
Then you push the picture a little way off the paper and put the piece on the corresponding place on the model (which you dampened beforehand).
While holding the decal on the model with a tool, you pull the carrier paper sideways.
Note: Always check if the picture is properly aligned before removing it from the paper, so that it doesn't stick to your fingers, knit or even tear.
Absorb any excess water with a household cloth.
Not suitable for children under 3 years
I can only open a book briefly if I look away, then I can no longer read it and have to log out and log in and download the book again and find my place.
I communicated with you on Saturday already.
Did I receive it by email?
For all 3 packages?
For the lamp came in 3 separate packages to me
ok thank you very much!
I will buy elsewhere as soon as the money is back.
Will I get it back without any problems though?
IVF treatment with private health insurance/ What is a "covered event"?
Hello everyone,
We spent a long time in infertility treatment, and now, when it comes to billing our health insurance, it's suddenly putting up a fight.
One after the other:
We applied in advance to the children's wish-tracking service with the health insurance company and were given approval for three attempts.
The attempts were not limited in any way (e.g. time frame, success, etc.).
The first attempt resulted in a successful pregnancy and birth, and was covered by health insurance.
Some time later we tried for a second child and had two (unsuccessful) attempts, but this was not taken into account by the health insurance company.
We again applied for cost coverage with the health insurance company and were again granted another three attempts.
After some further attempts (we carried out more experiments than we had agreed to, of course the most expensive ones with the health insurance company) we submitted the invoices to the health insurance company and received the unpleasant surprise: instead of 5 treatments (2+3) the health insurance company would only pay for 3 treatments.
The reason given: Pregnancy/birth means that the other two attempts at the first donation will be lost.
The second wish is a new insurance case.
According to the AGB, "The period of insurance cover begins with treatment and ends when treatment is no longer required."
Put your questions to the experts in the round here:
Who is right, the statutory health insurance (only 3 attempts are covered) or us (we have to pay 5 attempts)?
If the health insurance company had to point out to us in the assurances that with a birth the subsequent attempts would fall away?
Is the desire for a second child really a new insurance case?
Infertility (caused by blocked fallopian tubes) is not cured by the first child.
It would be great if the experts here could share their opinions.
Many thanks for your help already!
Could you please send me the three versions by email and let me know how to best retrieve them?
OK.
We will not order anything more from them.
When they added up my sales and my friend #NAME# (same address) they obviously lost a good customer.
They like to pass that on to their managers.
That is not competitive.
Yesterday, my colleague told me that the refund was processed and now you're telling me that I have to send the thing back first.
I can't do anything about the fact that the wardrobe is completely dishevelled when it arrives with me
Please see the screenshot of what my colleague wrote
It clearly states that the refund was triggered and I still have not received a refund via #PRS_ORG#
You can inform your manager that you have now lost two regular customers.
My friend also ordered various furniture for our apartment through his account.
We will not do that any more.
No, the fault only occurred after a few months.
An office chair must be able to withstand normal use.
Otherwise they are not allowed to sell it as an office chair.
Regardless, the guarantee of 24 months applies.
No, I am not able to change the type of packaging.
I will be able to take the cupboard down and make it available to the transport company.
Hello, I have a question about your series of #PRS_ORG#
These products are advertised with additional hoops to earn, but unfortunately we cannot find them for you.
Can they help?
Theme of the week: the best low budget films
What a low-budget film is, precisely, there is no general definition with exact budget limits.
Wikipedia has this to say on the matter:
一部低预算电影或低预算电影是一部由主要电影公司或私人投资者几乎没有资金支持的电影。
On the net you can find loads of lists of low budget films, for example on letterboxd.com.
Do you know interesting representatives of this category?
What irritates you about it?
And what maybe doesn't suit you at all?
I am a very good customer of yours, and have already completely furnished two apartments with your furniture.
Wanted to ask the best price for grey leather sofa Odelle.
The delivery time has been extended once again, is it now reliable?
Many thanks
Best regards,
If there is no telephone number, a chat where one has to wait 30 minutes is not a chat!
Unfortunately, nothing changes in the waiting position...I'll soon give up because it simply doesn't work here.
Hello
Half victory against Belarus comes at high cost for the EU
According to political expert Raphael Bossong, the EU can announce a "half victory" in the conflict with the Belarusian regime.
But the costs are very high, and mean massive violations of the rights of migrants and refugees at Belarus" borders with Poland and Lithuania," Bossong told the Protestant Press Service (epd).
The EU has not solved the confrontation in a sustainable way, declared the researcher from the Berlin Science and Policy Foundation (SWP).
This state of balance - Belarus is not quite small, but the EU feels itself to be the winner - will continue for a while.
Bossong judged that the treatment of people at the border was not in line with the European Convention on Human Rights.
Apparently there is an "increasing normalisation of pushbacks" by individual EU governments.
Because the EU as a whole is not determinedly against it, this is at the expense of basic rights.
This would weaken the cohesion in the Union at the same time.
It seems it cannot be implemented if a member state decides to go it alone, as currently Poland is refusing to allow access to its borders even to the EU's border protection agency, Frontex.
Furthermore, according to Bossong, the EU is paying a further price for its policy on the border with Belarus: an agreement on the basic principles of asylum policy is being made more difficult because the line "border protection, border protection, border protection" has been strengthened.
Yet another attempt to cross the border
According to information from Poland's border protection, migrants have once more attempted to reach Polish territory via Belarus.
55 migrants were detained overnight Saturday and returned to the border, said an official speaking Sunday.
The Polish officials were reportedly pelted with stones by migrants near the village of Czeremsza.
According to that information, a soldier suffered a facial injury and had to be treated by a military doctor.
In total, the border protection agency registered 52 attempted border crossings within 24 hours.
A group of 28 migrants had already overcome the border barriers on Friday evening.
Thousands of people from countries like Iraq and Afghanistan had crossed or tried to cross the border between Belarus and the EU in the past few months.
The EU accuses Alexander Lukaschenko, the ruler in Minsk, of keeping them locked in with the prospect of entry to the EU.
According to press reports, Poland and Lithuania have cordoned off border sections.
The EU imposed sanctions on Belarus and threatened airlines that brought migrants and refugees into the country.
In addition, EU commissioners are travelling to the countries of origin of the people in order to prevent departures.
The most effective element of the EU reaction was the pressure put on the airlines, said Bossong.
In that, the EU has thrown its weight into the balance, and demonstrated its determination to operate a tough bandage and extraterritorial sanctions.
Minsk must also take internal political costs into account.
The Belarussians are unlikely to be happy about the security services regularly shipping thousands of people across the country.
Mercedes protests after controversial Formula One finale
Max Verstappen was judged by Mercedes to have committed two rule breaches during the race.
Abu Dhabi - After the controversial Formula 1 final in Abu Dhabi, Mercedes has appealed.
The silver arrows are suspected of breaking two rules in the last Grand Prix of the year.
A protest relates to a perceived infringement by Max Verstappen in the Red Bull during the last safety car period, when he was deemed to have illegally overtaken.
A second objection was raised against the decision at the end of the race.
According to Mercedes, the protocol was not complied with.
Verstappen had overtaken Lewis Hamilton's Mercedes on the last lap to win his first Formula One title.
The manoeuvre came shortly after the end of a safety car period in which the Dutchman had overtaken the car in front of him.
I'll check that.
I speak to the bank and register with you again
thanks for the support
Free admission for members: Europa-Park hosts SC Freiburg fantasy day
Europe Park, the namesake of the SC Freiburg Europa Park stadium, has invited SC Freiburg Fantag.
As the park reported, members and season-ticket holders of the Sport-Club from Breisgau as well as members of the fan community were able to visit the Europa-Park free of charge on this day.
There were also vouchers for drinks and sausages.
The rollercoaster trains glowed red and white that day through the jerseys.
Füchsle, Ed Euromaus and many red-white balloons provided the perfect backdrop," said the park.
The collaboration between the Bundesliga side and the holiday park in Rust, 40 kilometres north of Freiburg, goes back to the early 90s.
The first Freiburg Fantag at Europa-Park has once again shown how well the partnership fits together.
Seeing happy fans having fun on the rollercoaster is a confirmation of this," says Europa-Park owner Jürgen Mack.
Why is that €#NUMBER# and not originally €1699€?

Judith Hermann read from her novel "At Home"
As part of the "LiteraTour Nord" reading series, author Judith Hermann read from her current novel "At Home" on Friday in the sold-out Blue Note, and also served as the moderator.
She is divorced, lives in a house on the coast and listens sensitively to the nocturnal sounds on her front door.
I filled out the contact form to return an item yesterday but did not receive an email confirmation or anything similar.
My question would be whether my request has been noted.
Not everyone has the time for your botched chat and cheap junk from China.
Their mistake, that you rectify, not all from our budget.
Contact Frau #NAME#.
I can't chat with them every day
We chatted yesterday and agreed that I/Mrs #NAME# would receive an email with a €60 voucher, a renewed order of the #PRS_ORG# nightstand and a return label.

Sorry but just because he says he is not antisemitic, that does not mean anything.
That is how it is when a thief says he has nothing against foreigners.
Neither of them will admit it.
But Kollegah is constantly reproducing some kind of anti-Semitic message.
If you want to distance yourself, then you should do so completely.
Yes wow then you are just as unserious as Kollegah.
Anyone who seriously questions the fundamental principles of evolution is just completely lost.
In my opinion, a God set the whole thing in motion.
But once you're a creationist, you have to believe that the Earth is 10,000 years old and that science is full of nonsense.
And that makes you an enemy of science and not to be taken seriously like Kollegah
In order to obtain an optimal field of vision, the magnifying glass should be held as close to the eye as possible.
The specially plan-achromatised lens system allows you to use the microscope for practical recording and error-free colour use right to the edge of the field.
Magnifying glasses are often marked with a magnification figure.
But these details are only valid for the exact conditions of use, which rarely comply with the conditions of use.
To get the best out of your magnifier, please take note of the hints in the table "Technical Data" (see the instructions in the packaging).
Light reflections occur on the lens surfaces of all optical devices - even in impact scopes.
By applying an anti-reflective coating, these reflections are significantly reduced.
When used under ideal conditions - the loupe close to the eye - reflections on the lens surfaces are less noticeable.
Further information can be found in the accompanying user manual (German and English available).

Christmas tree sales in Schönwolde: Women are looking for Christmas trees in the Krembz district
Farmer Frank Diers has experienced many curious situations when selling Christmas trees.
In one case, a man even drove his partner home again because they couldn't reach an agreement.
He plants around 2000 of them every year.
The 56-year-old has experienced so many strange situations.
That makes the run-up to Christmas always fun, he says.
And the voucher?
Otherwise, I'm a customer?!
I did receive a defective delivery, and now I have paid the full price for it.
Then I will also assess it accordingly!
We don't need to argue here about the better court, but there is a certain similarity between the two.
Both consist of meat that is grilled on a rotating spit.
And so both have their name.
In English, an equivalent might be something like "the one that twists," which doesn't sound nearly as nice.
Problems with fibre glass + Devolo LAN/Magic
We have had a new fibre optic connection in our house for a few weeks.
Unfortunately, I am now having problems building a stable WiFi network.
I had a 50 Mbit DSL line before and used Devolo DLAN, which flawlessly received and transmitted 50 Mbit, apart from a few glitches.
The new fibre optic connection delivers 500 Mbit to the FritzBox 7590 and via the LAN module, which is connected to the FritzBox, these come too.
However, on the other DLAN module, which transmits the WiFi, it no longer receives the full 500, but the fewer I am in the house with the module, the fewer it receives (i.e. use a socket that is 1, 2, 3 etc. rooms away from the other module).
This means that with the new fibre optic connection, the Internet in the first floor is now slower than before (\~45 Mbit).
I have also ordered a new Devolo Magic Set, which seems to use a new technology.
This was slightly better than the DSL, but there were similar huge losses here too.
Can someone explain to me why so much internet speed via fibre-optic cables is "lost" over the power lines?
And is LAN really the only solution?
It would be extremely expensive to lay LAN cables in the house.
I am really struggling why I have had to create an account specifically for this.
That is why I would be all the more delighted to receive an answer.
When it's time to change your current account
Anyone who thought that, for now, the peace would be with their current account, has been proved wrong.
While many banks used the autumn to get their hands on all sorts of sneaky ways of confirming past fee increases from their customers, the waivers on negative interest rates are also continuing to shrink.
Deutsche Bank, for example, was long considered to be relatively generous with a limit of 100,000 euros.
Now they have halved the lump sum and even quadrupled the daily rate.
In a first step, the limit was reduced only for customers of the corporate section of Postbank – to €50,000 for current and investment accounts, and to €25,000 for day-to-day accounts.
However, according to a spokesperson, these lower fees now apply to the entire German banking industry.
And not just for new contracts, but also for "new individual agreements with existing customers".
The Commerzbank had already previously reduced the limit to 50,000 euros, which still applies, as does the case with ING Germany.
The popular direct bank DKB, which is loved by cost-conscious customers, has reduced the allowance in two stages, first to 50,000 euros and now to 25,000 euros.
Nevertheless: according to figures from internet portal Verivox, more than 100 banks now have a minimum deposit of 25,000 euros or less.
The Sparda Bank in Berlin has also reached a limit of 25,000 euros: However, a legal battle is still ongoing there with consumer centres, which have already won a ruling in their favour on this matter in the Berlin regional court.
Now the issue is being discussed in banks as to whether the institutions should set aside reserves - for the event that the higher instances also declare the negative interest rates to be unlawful and millions of bank customers must be repaid.

Jennifer Aniston has her own beauty army
It now officially rules Hollywood.
Yet her life is a journey of peaks and troughs.
Jennifer Aniston (52) has been voted the most influential woman of the year by US magazine "The Hollywood Reporter".
For her, the success of 2021's Friends reunion and the continuation of her series The Morning Show, is largely down to discipline and hard work.
An army of assistants, stylists and trainers are all busy thinking about how she looks.
Still, Aniston maintains she only has one a day (yes, that's one chip out of a bag).
It is really something of a miracle that their male and female fans alike have fallen in love with them.
Perhaps because she is simply unlucky in love - and is still searching for that big love.
And has removed the wish for a baby from the list.
She was asked again and again when she would become a mother.
That hurt her.
The people who ask don't have a clue what's going on with me personally, medically why I can't.
It was really hurtful.
It remains to be hoped that success and fame will make them happy.
Unworthy end to a career: Raikkonen has to give up
Kimi Raikkonen's exit from Formula One has been more quiet than expected.
Abu Dhabi - The 42-year-old Finn took off his gloves and wiped the sweat from his brow.
That's it.
Räikkönen was forced to retire from the Grand Prix in Abu Dhabi after not even half a race distance when he went off the track and lightly touched the barriers.
It was his 349th and final Grand Prix, and the "Iceman" has ended his career in the top echelon of motorsport.
His wife Minttu and their two children had also travelled to the United Arab Emirates for the trip.
Räikkönen's greatest achievement was winning the 2007 World Championship in a Ferrari.
He won 21 Grand Prix races, started from pole 18 times and reached the podium 103 times. dpa
Friedrich achieves his 60th World Cup victory - Nolte wins in the two-man bob - Sport
The target for the bob-sleigh pilot is the record of 94 victories set by Norwegian biathlete Ole Einar Björndalen.
I have worked it out, I would have to win neuneinhalb races per season, then I could make it to Cortina 2026, said the double Olympic champion from BSC Oberbärenburg, who achieved two victories in two days at the races in Winterberg.
He fended off an attack from Johannes Lochner on Saturday, moving from third place to first by a hundredth of a second.
He then changed something on the set-up of the car and went out on Sunday with a 0.30 second advantage.
He and his team of Thorsten Margis (SV Halle), Candy Bauer (BSC Oberbärenburg) and Alexander Schüller (SV Halle) beat the Brit, Brad Hall.
Third was Austrian Benjamin Maier.
We took a bigger risk today and were rewarded for it, said Friedrich, who also recorded his 22nd win in a row.
Resident of Berchtesgaden Johannes Lochner, who had come in second for Stuttgart, this time took fifth place.
After taking fourth place in the first race, Christoph Hafer from BC Bad Feilnbach came in eighth.
If I knew what he was doing differently, I would do the same, Lochner said.
No home win - Podium for Jamanka
For the women, Laura Nolte on her home track claimed the third win of the season in the bob-sleigh.
After finishing only in fourth place in the monobob on the previous day, she raced to victory in the World Cup on Sunday, with pusher Deborah Levi.
The two-man bob Olympic champion, Mariama Jamanka from BRC Thüringen, came in second place with Germany's fastest sprinter, Alexandra Burghardt from Burghausen.
She also recorded her first podium finish of the winter, in addition to qualifying for the Olympics.
Wiesbaden's Kim Kalicki came in third place with Leonie Fiebig.
It was super cool for me to get the first podium in the World Cup, I am super happy that Mariama took me with her.
I am super happy with the development.
There is still a lot of potential there, but the start times today were okay," said Burghardt, stressing that "it's not just about pushing, but there is a lot to do around it".
Jamanka was a little irritated by the journey that was not completely flawless, but he said: "It's going in the right direction".
I had the blanket in my shopping cart and could buy it now!!!
What should I do?
I simply did not receive it and therefore could not redeem it, which is why I have finally asked.
Last year I had different problems because of Corona and never had time for that.
Now he is saying he has upped and left which has made me very cross.
Look in the chat, it was about the Asare deckchair.
I want to return it and reorder as it's currently reduced!
Why will delivery only start on 16th March?
There was nothing on your website about such long delivery times
No, not until I click on it does an extra field with the message appear
Was taken by your colleague yesterday.
Why is that a problem today
I have also sent you pictures of the wrong item.
However, we still want the tray module, just a new undamaged one
And not cancel the entire order.
Only today, only this week, only until XY...
Hello dear wonderful girls and women
I have something I want to write and perhaps this - or someone else too...
I'm 24, have a part-time job and am a mum to a dog - apart from the fact that my dog doesn't bark or go to nursery, he is basically my one and only child.
My friend (together since 6th grade) is sick, got a 2nd degree burn on Monday, and has been depressed for years (but is in therapy now).
Yesterday I went to see him because I have emotional needs too, and because I want to see and feel him, we cuddled a lot and it was nice.
I helped him in the shower (because his hand is in a cast due to burns).
On top of that, he's become cold and we currently see each other less (1-2 times a week), which is really getting me down with my need for affection and love.
My puppy is grumpy at the moment, I made food for him and now he is under his blanket and has relaxed a bit after I put the heat lamp and stroked him.
I live alone with my sister and my mother, and she has just gone away for a month.
Now we've also got homework to do as well, which we of course split between us.
But even cooking is a lot of work for me...
My PTBS illness is going really well, I am halfway through treatment and getting there.
Not good, but I'm managing and I'm almost symptom free.
My university demands a lot from me right now; I have a written test tomorrow at 3pm that I haven't prepared for and an anatomy lesson the day after tomorrow that I should at least prepare a bit for.
And next Tuesday I have an oral exam, and what comes next is in my calendar and not in my head because there is no space left.
So my week goes: Only until tomorrow, then it's the weekend.
But after that, everything just carries on regardless?
Just until your birthday.
Just until the holidays begin.
Just until the weekend.
Just until...
And so it goes on for ever.
I think I'm just so stressed right now that I need these mental markers because otherwise I'd crack.
Somehow I feel guilty and "chaotic", but I can't do it any other way...
Is it the same for you?
My dear, I am infinitely grateful not to have to work.
I am truly infinite grateful, I cannot express it in words.
I don't know if I would have survived my childhood otherwise.
I think that has a lot to do with women's mental load and that's why I thought I'd find kindred spirits here...
Have a good evening for sure, the week is almost over!
I received my order today, unfortunately it's a completely different shade and the surface is scratched and the table leg has a mark on it.
The first delivery was the same colour as on the website.
We are very disappointed!!!
What can you offer me?
If we change the table now, will I get another colour or what?
The email regarding the cancellation was sent on 26.12.#NUMBER#.
Twice, otherwise.
This was not confirmed, however.
Entirely different: I realised back then at school that many religious teachers do not believe in God, and for them it is just another subject like maths or geography.
For me that was always something strange, perhaps because I was brought up Christian and I have always somehow believed it.
What do you think?
Perhaps you could also talk to colleagues at work or study with about different attitudes.
Fundamentally I understand the difference between private and professional and it makes sense to keep the two separate.
There is also a syllabus etc.
But it would be simply strange to have a physics teacher who does not believe in the theory of relativity.
What then drives someone to want to learn about religion if they don't believe in it?
Upholding culture or something?
I hope the question is not too personal.
Can it not be changed or not?Write in English, I understand that well
That is a very long time, then I would give up
That's good, thanks.
I expect to hear back immediately, at the latest by the beginning of next week.
Thank you for your support #NAME#.
Please help me search for films.
Hello dear people,
I am looking for a film from my childhood (24).
I think it was a film for youngsters.
In the film there are two timelines (or parallel worlds).
On the one hand, the modern (real world)
On the other hand, the past (or the realm of the dead) (not quite sure).
Because I can't describe it any closer in the real world, there is a young woman.
And in the land of the dead a young soldier (uniform similar to that of the soldiers from the Curse of the Caribbean).
For some reason their paths cross and something happens.
The antagonist is also a soldier from the kingdom of the dead who wants to take the woman to this kingdom in order to survive, I think.
The transition is also, I believe, the soldier's grave.
In the end, I believe both soldiers are fighting against each other.
If this tells you something, I am grateful for every answer.
Our little one has only slept on her tummy from week 1.
Fast forward: lives :D
Relax.
So a child holds out much longer than one thinks.
Make sure that everything is correct, no soft toys, go in and look sometimes, but no minutes of surveillance.
That would drive you crazy!
Fresh air in the room.
Good mattress.
No cushions.
Achso and ours didn't have a sleeping bag, but always a blanket.
Observe your child when he or she is asleep.
Turns your head to one side?
Can something come from the gut?
Or is it with the face in front, directly on the mattress?
That is how you can tell if everything is alright.
We have also all grown up and by the time my husband came along, it was a case of zig-zagging around the place putting the kids to bed.
We are already "main customers" with you and have already bought many items.
But why then are you only offering me 20EUR?
Hello, I wrote to one of your colleagues yesterday and have had no response so far.
It's about my wardrobe that arrived yesterday (order number: #ALPHANUMERIC-ID#).
The right drawer doesn't fit in the cupboard.
Please contact me as soon as possible.
As a result, the cupboard is currently not usable.
To put it clearly.
RBTV has promised much.
And, yes, I know that not everything can be kept.
And I also very much enjoyed working for RBTV.
It is just that simple that the politics of this broadcaster are now under a cloud.
Every format is sponsored (ok), but then go on a big begging tour at the same time.
It says it is an "independent" internet TV channel.
Quote from Arno: "We don't want to be a litre column."
What are we now?
An 0815 broadcaster attempting to flog his BilloMerch to the elite fan.
And then we have Marah's do's and don'ts.
Except for Simon and Etienne, of course.
Of course people will continue to be offended.
A Krogmann, who is completely lacking in empathy, is trying to make a profit from the campaign by sub-letting the exploded rooms.
How should one find all of this good?
Toll if you like, I find it terrifying.
I am writing to request a recall as my delivered wooden table is defective.

Whether as a comforter for tummy ache or simply for cuddling - my little warm friend has many uses.
Kirschkern-cushions are a traditional home remedy for comfortable heating purposes, as kirsch cherries absorb heat very well and can be dosed to release it again.
The detachable inner cushion is very easy to warm up in the microwave or in the oven.
The soft towel makes application particularly pleasant, so that even if they are not doing so well, small children feel safe.
The cherry stone cushion with a cover is suitable as a heat pad only for the following applications:
Before warming up kissens on an unusual smell, check for stock or burn marks and remove them immediately if present.
Please remove the inner cushion from the cover before warming it up!
Heat in the microwave using a maximum of 300 watts for a maximum of 2 minutes (pay attention to the microwave manufacturer's instructions!).
Immediately after heating, distribute the warmth evenly in the cushion by shaking!
Next, put the inner cushion back into the cover.
On initial heating, a slight moisture formation can occur on the surface, but this disappears with repeated use.
Adhere to the specified heating hints, as longer periods or higher energy output can lead to damage (flammability and burning danger!).
Before microwaving the kissens, check the manufacturer's instructions for permission to heat grains.
Once the warmed inner lining has been put back into the cover, please check the temperature of the Kissen on your wrist (max 43°C) suitable for babies!
Don't use the cushion for acute and chronic, inflammatory or feverish conditions, circulatory problems, fresh haematomas, haemorrhages and open wounds, or people with reduced pain sensitivity.
If you have existing skin, heart, vein, diabetes or tumour conditions, or are pregnant, please consult a doctor before use.
If seams have opened and loose filling is coming out, dispose of the product and the loose filling immediately and out of the reach of children.
If the product is applied to babies under 1 year old, the temperature of the child should be monitored during application in order to avoid overheating!
All serious incidents relating to the product must be reported to the manufacturer and the competent authority of the country in which the user is established.
The cover is removable and can be washed at 30°C in the machine.
Please note the care symbols on the product!
Darmstadt second in series - Pauli wins in Dusseldorf
Darmstadt 98 may dream of a return to the Bundesliga.
Meanwhile, Hannover 96 are working their way out of the relegation zone.
It's not going well for Ingolstadt under the third coach.

Is the battery dead?
Last night, my laptop (ThinkPad E480 20KQ and about 3 years old) was no longer charged through its power supply.
I bought this about 5 months ago, so it should still work.
I thought a power supply alone would be enough to run it.
The battery is empty and the laptop will no longer start, despite the charger being plugged in.
I then removed the battery, but that didn't work either.
Do you have any ideas?
A new battery is on order, but why can't I use the laptop while it's connected?
Is anything else broken?
Many thanks for your help!
I would like the delivery of the #PRS_ORG# to be brought to my room.
How can I book it?
I am interested in the #PRS_ORG# chair.
But we don't know how high the seat is...
Are you often on tour and yet have a lot of equipment with you?
The Everyday V2 Backpack from Peak Design is the solution!
Its 20 litre capacity will also swallow larger camera set-ups without any problems, and these can be securely stowed using the padded FlexFold dividers.
And what you need of everyday items, remains, thanks to practical access, well-organised and separable from the photo equipment in the individually configurable interior space.
With the "update" of the Everyday Line to version 2 (V2), the range is also presented in a new look.
Its sleek, minimalist design is proverbial - with the Everyday Backpack series, Peak Design has developed some highly innovative solutions that protect the interior of the backpack reliably, and at the same time, allow seconds access to photo equipment.
This works in two ways: conventionally through the hinged flap which can be locked using the MagLatch locking system, a superbly thought-out solution for effective protection that has already been tried and tested at the Messenger Bags.
The closure has a metal clip with a matching anchor bar on the front of the rucksack.
Unlike most backpacks, Peak Design has thought of several "stuff sacks": there are actually 4 aluminium bars, securely riveted, into which the closure fittings can be hammered.
If the rucksack is full, you simply take the top beam; if it is rather empty, you take a deeper one.
The catch and hook are also magnetic.
As a result, the rucksack can be reliably closed without having to insert the hook.
The second option differentiates the Everyday Backpack fundamentally from other camera backpacks: in addition to the flap, there is a zip opening on both sides of the backpack.
This eliminates the main disadvantage of traditional backpacks with top access - you no longer have to rummage through the contents!
At the same time, this clever detail hugely increases the practicality of the rucksack: if you not only take your photo equipment, but also everyday items or travel gear.
In the Everyday Backpack you can configure the interior space individually (more on that below) and so store both items separately – and access them independently through the two side openings.
As a result, you can also pull the rucksack towards you from the right so that you can access the camera equipment in the right main compartment, for example, without the everyday items getting in the way.
Comfortable, easily adjustable straps help with this.
And because the rucksack's outer cover is made from 100 per cent recycled, waterproof nylon, its contents will stay dry even if it's going to Scotland in the autumn.
Unfortunately, I'm still waiting for an email from their support.
#NAME# sent me an email yesterday confirming the appointment
Contact has been made by the delivery company regarding the collection of the wrongly delivered table.
I haven't heard anything yet.
I request an immediate resolution.
I am now writing to my third 'support' employee, none of whom have got me any further than a promise that I will receive an email confirmation.
It concerns the return of the incorrectly delivered custom #NAME#
When can you expect delivery of the wardrobe?
To keep him at that level is not an option for me...
It works.
Many many thanks for the help

Hello, my order number is #NUMBER#. When will the article be delivered?
The order and payment were on 12.1.21.
I received a completely different lamp to the one I ordered
Please call me
If you extend the voucher, I will place a larger order immediately, but nevertheless I have kept the damaged piece of furniture and not sent it back.
And I couldn't imagine that last year would turn out differently than planned and so I just couldn't find the time to implement and clarify it.
As a customer, I suffered the loss, and I do not accept it like that.
The Rotinger brake discs are designed for the requirements of the dynamic driver, who knows how to appreciate safety and reliability even under difficult conditions when braking.
Rotating brake discs are made from castings and are then mechanically processed (drilled and cut).
All ground glass plates are manufactured in short series according to individual technical properties which are specific for certain plates and patterns.
On the basis of the individual technical drawing, a special production programme is set up which is geared to the cutting of the sheet according to the characteristics of the original installation.
The tinted glass thus produced ensures high comfort and braking efficiency.
Additional openings improve the effectiveness of cooling the disc, with the slots improving the cleaning of the brake discs and pads.
The aesthetic properties of our painted glass underline the attractive and striking appearance of every car.
Coloma is the town where an unexpected event shaped the history of the West Coast.
In the winter of 1848, a man discovered glowing fragments in the water near the southern fork of the American River.
Though he tried to keep his discovery a secret, the news quickly spread and set off the so-called "California Gold Rush" of '49.
Thousands arrived from near and far, making Colima one of the fastest-growing and most prosperous cities in the country.
Sections were marked out, tents were pitched and saloons and hotels appeared almost overnight.
Everyone wanted a share in the country's wealth.
For many it was "Coloma or Bust" (Coloma or Bankruptcy)!
In this game you are a pioneer, seeking wealth in the west and wanting to make a name for yourself.
You will search for gold, recruit workers, round up horses and build businesses.
You will also have the opportunity to explore the surrounding riverbanks and adjoining areas.
You're not alone - the other pioneers seem to have had the same idea!
You have to outperform your peers to avoid going bust like them.
Coloma is a fast-paced strategy game with many paths to victory.
You choose your actions simultaneously, have to manage your resources and set up a tableau which works more and more for you (so-called "engine building").
The buildings on your board allow you to be more efficient, get extra actions, or bend the rules in your favor.
With these buildings and the dynamic bridge tiles, you can fine-tune your individual playing style.
Coloma plays out over a period of three years, from 1848 (the year the gold at Coloma was discovered), through 1849 (the year of the California Gold Rush), to 1850 (the year California achieved statehood).
A year in Coloma consists of five rounds.
During each round, players will secretly and simultaneously choose a location on the board where they can carry out actions.
A selection is then revealed and they place their pioneers on the relevant locations.
If a location has the most pioneers, it gets a lockdown!
This deactivates half of the location - reducing the possible actions that can be taken there.
Players then take turns carrying out actions such as winning resources, moving wagons, setting up tents, searching rivers, building bridges, opening stores and positioning revolver heroes.
When all the actions have been completed, the pioneers return.
The announcer rotates to a new location at the beginning of each round, changing the available actions.
This will continue until the caller has moved five times, thus once covering each location, and the year ends.
There is a shoot-out in which players must defend Coloma from an attack by marauding bandits.
If players have contributed enough revolver heroes, and have given due consideration to the bandits, they will receive rewards.
But when they fail, they receive lesser rewards or end up in the graveyard.
The game ends after the third shooting range, then there is the final ranking.
The player with the most victory points wins!

Why children are not tyrants: Documentary, ARD Mediathek
CW psychological violence, sexual abuse, abuse of power
The ARD documentary appeared in my Twitter timeline today and I watched it immediately.
Child psychiatrist Michael Winterhoff is a frequent guest on talk shows and gives lectures all over Europe.
With his book "Why Our Children Become Tyrants" (2008), he touched off a heated debate about education.
Former patients and those with parental responsibility are now making serious accusations against him.
Please be aware, the film is hard to bear.
And I am very grateful that many people now think and act differently.
Parents and other responsible adults must never, never, never relinquish control over the child.
Our goal must always be to give the child space for their development and to make the framework for the child as large as possible within the given situation.
Brrr, it still gives me goosebumps.
Holetschek: Countries are discussing the scrapping of the obligation to take the test for those who have had three doses
The health ministers of the states want to decide at their next meeting whether to scrap the testing requirement for those who have had three doses of the vaccine.
The countries need clarity quickly as to whether and when vaccinated individuals are no longer required to take the test," said Klaus Holetschek (CSU), chairman of the conference of health ministers, speaking to "Bild am Sonntag".
The dropping of the third dose of the vaccine was "not only medically reasonable, but also provides an additional booster," said Holetschek.
Federal Health Minister Karl Lauterbach (SPD) has promised that "he will make a proposal to the health ministers' conference already next Tuesday". − afp

Hello, I think the #PRS_ORG# chair is very nice, but I can't see how high the seat is.
Can you help me further?
I can no longer complete any purchases through my #PRS_ORG.

Shopping over the #PRS_ORG# page on the computer goes.
I have updated my account information.
What is the cause of this?
What you are describing is referred to as *awareness*, i.e. perceptions under full anaesthesia.
They occur at a frequency of around 1 in 1000.
The most common are sounds/voices, less frequently are images seen, and least of all are pains perceived.
Relevant for this topic: Caesarean sections are operations that go hand in hand with a heightened rate of awareness, since in order to protect the child until the umbilical cord is cut, a very deep anaesthetic is avoided.
Any previous episodes of anaesthesia should be mentioned in the anaesthetic consultation.
Certain types of anesthesia, such as total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA), are associated with a slightly increased risk.
**EDIT: Hello everyone, this comment of mine describes awareness correctly, however, by definition, u/Nitemarex had none.**
Misread her comment.
But the chair is defective.
The 20 euros are not helping us there, unfortunately.
This is about statutory entitlements.
The absolute minimum would be if they took the defective chair away.
This is not only a legal requirement, but also standard practice in e-commerce.
Please check again if they at least take the broken chair back.
We then sell the second seat privately.
We will also lose out financially.
I sent you an email that you did not answer.
Once again the question.
The order and the invoice specify that the goods are delivered to a room of my choice.
The courier company is #NAME#.
I just tried calling there.
They told me they only deliver to the front door - because of #PRS_ORG#.
Is that so?
If so I will have to cancel the order as I don't know anyone who can help me carry the heavy furniture upstairs.
Am I not called?
I had formulated a question.
Theatre historian Günther Rühle dies at 97
He has profiled himself as a theatre critic and as an artistic director.
He later wrote a monumental theatre history.
Günther Rühle died on Friday, at the age of 97.
So there is the new book, freshly printed: "An Old Man Gets Older".
An unsettling diary of a slow withdrawal from the world, which the theatre historian and journalist Günther Rühle has kept until April 2021.
And in the middle of reading comes the news that the author has died.
The final sentence in the book reads: "I hereby give thanks for my life".
There are different types of palettes.
One of the most common are Europallets, standard wooden pallets, which are used above all in the European region as a means of transport.
They are certified by the European Pallet Association, EPAL.
According to data from Statistics Austria, over 10 million palettes were produced in Austria in 2020.
The production value was around 79 million euros.
How many paletts are imported into Austria each year will not be charged
New York clinches first MLS championship
New York City FC has won the title for the first time in Major League Soccer.
After a 1-1 draw in regular time against host Portland Timbers, the team from the Eastern Conference won the final 4-2 in a penalty shootout.
In the final of the Eastern Conference, New York had gotten the better of Philadelphia Union, the team of German Kai Wagner.
Roulette Tips & Tricks
I got loads of great tips here a week ago for the perfect stew.
We had that at Christmas and it was absolutely delicious and creamy!
So thanks again for that :)
Now I've got a taste for it and I want to cook rouladen for New Year's Eve for the first time.
Tomorrow I will use the beef fund to pay for it.
Do you have any other tips for me?
Note: I don't have an oven, I only have a big pot.
What happens now?
What about the books? How do I get them back on my #PRS_ORG#?
My English is not as good as it was, but I am getting there
IEs is about a refund of €#NUMBER#
I was informed by email on 18th January that the refund had been processed.
To this day, however, the money has not appeared in my account.
Please check that.
Where you can still get Christmas roast in the Lübeck region
For many people, goose or duck is a tradition at Christmas, just like the Christmas tree and presents.
Have you not got your chicken yet?
Now time is short.
We'll tell you where you can still get a Christmas roast in the Lübeck region.
The "drive" of a tube amplifier stage plays a crucial role in determining the heat and fatigue of the guitar amplifier sound.
These features are perfectly implemented by Valve's reactor circuit.
With the VOLUME, GAIN and MASTER VOLUME controls you can set both the desired level and the stereo balance of your sounds.
The VT+ series amplifiers also offer a unique POWER LEVEL control which allows you to reduce the gain without changing anything on the "Gain" control or the distortion.
A little earlier, it was mentioned that the POWER LEVEL regulator can even call upon a performance reserve if it gets too noisy.
Thanks to the POWER LEVEL regulator, the full potential of the VT+ series can be utilised in any situation.
The headphone socket can also be used as a line output.
The signal here is processed with a box simulator so that even when using headphones or making direct recordings, you get an eminently "acoustic" sound impression.
An aux-in socket allows a CD or MP3 player to be connected so that you can listen to your favourite tunes.
A tuning function is also on board – so you don't need a separate tuning device.
If you additionally invest in a VFS5 footswitch, you can call up the sounds comfortably using your foot, switch the effect blocks on/off and adjust the tempo of the compatible effects "tapping".
This is essential for live deployment.
With its new power packages, VOX is taking another step into the future!
But others saw it differently.
Will you then have the possibility to send the lamp back?
Because they're too low over a table to eat?
So I would then send them back.
Can you help me with that?
And the wardrobe?
Can we expect another update on the precise delivery date over the next few weeks?
Hello, have they sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs yet
If it doesn't work out, I'd be happy with a refund or voucher.
Depending on the circumstances, I may find a buyer for the furniture.
Over 1,000 euros for goods that I don't need is still a bit much.
I have just received my delivery and would like to know whether screws were included as part of the delivery.
I would like to mount the #PRS_ORG# mirror (door) on the designated hook.
This is not a satisfactory response and the wait has not been worth it
Do you have a premium customer status?
Iran sees progress in nuclear deal talks
According to Iranian information, progress is being made during negotiations about the revival of the international nuclear accord.
Both sides are close to agreeing on the agenda items, chief Iranian negotiator Ali Bagheri was quoted as saying by the state-run IRNA news agency Sunday.
He said this was a "positive and important development," because initially there had not even been agreement about what to negotiate.
The agreement is intended to prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons.
On Thursday, the Vienna talks to revive the agreement resumed after a break of less than one week.
Negotiators from Iran, Germany, Great Britain, China, France and Russia are taking part in the talks.
Another US delegation is in Vienna, but is only indirectly involved in the negotiations.
Thuringia overtakes Saxony - state now has highest Corona incidence
Thuringia has overtaken Saxony and currently has the highest incidence in the country.
This is the only federal state where the value is above the 1000 mark.
Thuringia was the only federal state where the corona virus infection rate exceeded 1000 on Sunday.
The Robert Koch Institute gave the seven-day value as 1,025 new infections per 100,000 residents.
In Saxony, which has recently always shown the highest incidence nationwide, this figure stood at 990.5 on Sunday.
On Friday and Saturday the incidence in Thuringia slightly decreased, but still lay above 1000.
In Thüringen, 2242 new cases of infection with the Sars-CoV-2 virus and 16 further deaths in connection with an infection were reported within a day.
On Sunday, 200 severe Covid-19 cases were treated in hospital intensive care units.
Registration delays can occur at weekends.
In addition, health authorities have been swamped for weeks and are barely keeping up with the recording of new cases.
I understand.
As delivery won't take place until early March, that may be possible.
I have to print it and stick it on the package and take it to the post office, right?
Do I need to click/input/fill in anything else?
That is exactly what I want to avoid, which is why I am writing to you.
I would be happy to arrange for the return at my own cost.
I think that €8 return fee is a cheek.
It's time for change
The German Bundestag greeted me, I am in the plenary hall in the heart of Europe on a fantastic day!
Why this post?
If one looks at the activity in the Bundestag over the past few months, one thing becomes clear: it doesn't exist.
We've fallen into a winter rut and extended the summer drought for a few months.
#Where is the problem?
Yes, what was it?
That is largely down to dissatisfaction with how things have been going and how we are generally doing.
Over the last few days, it has become increasingly apparent that many people here are really enthusiastic about the German Bundestag.
What we must change
At this point the community around the German Bundestag is asking which of these it wants to keep alive.
The impetus came from u/edizVEVO, who turned up to this project in the last few days and found, simply put, a mess.
After some back-and-forth, several people from the community came forward to express interest in reviving the project.
However, I would like to call upon everyone once more to participate, so that this project can continue to exist in the future.
We have established a discussion platform in the form of a Discord server, on which we can exchange ideas with one another and work on concrete things.
You can access the server via this link.
Goals:
How should the German Bundestag work in the future?
What existing orders need to be changed / adapted / removed?
How should we present ourselves abroad in the future?
How should new members be recruited?
How do we achieve a fair voting system?
I am pretty sure I missed something, but it's not a big deal, we can discuss it at the end on Discord.
If you are interested and have the time, come to the Discord, work with us, and let's decide democratically about the future.
I have ordered a lamp shade from you that is still being delivered.
Now I see that the article is too large/bulky and not suitable for my taste.
I have already ordered another fixing for you.
I put it together and realised it when I took the soft foam.
Very sad about it.
I hope that is returned and I get a full refund.
This is also pretty sad since the #NAME# is much darker than expected.
I have another question: does the daily cover #PRS_ORG# also come in oversize, for example in 240/240?
#PRS_ORG# must be able to guarantee that the faulty wardrobe will be collected promptly.
And I beg you to do so now.
I don't have suitable packaging, but I will remove the shelf as far as possible for collection - they must contact #PRS_ORG# to arrange this.
Anyone can contact me at any time to arrange a collection date.
Is there an instruction manual for the installation?
How long do I have to sort these out/decide to send them back?
How do you respond to the question of why you are vegan?
Today I had a conversation with a colleague that I like very much.
She herself lived for a while as a vegetarian, and currently also rarely eats meat.
I myself was a vegetarian for several years before that.
When asked if I had always wanted to be vegan and if vegetarianism had been a planned stepping stone, I honestly answered without much thought.
And indeed, that for a long time I thought that as a vegetarian I was supporting animal welfare, but at some point I reflected and understood that in doing so I was ultimately supporting animal cruelty.
So my decision to become vegan.
In that moment I got the impression that discontent had arisen on their side, whereupon she defended vegetarianism and said she knew where her meat comes from and as a vegetarian she reduces animal suffering.
So now I ask myself whether my answer was too "blunt"?
How do you answer the question?
I have the feeling that as a vegan one quickly gets stuck in a corner and conflicts arise that one wouldn't want.
It greets a harmony-loving vegan (;
It is clearly not an exception according to Section 312d of the German Civil Code.
Their #PRS_ORG# do not relieve them of the legal provisions governing remote selling.
I will not be available on the date specified by #PRS_ORG# to collect my return in person.
As I cannot be there in person for a funeral, that cannot be changed, unfortunately.
Can you please assign me an alternative pick-up time?
I will be available from 01.02.#NUMBER#
Lahnsteiner flood protection scheme for water rescue: €45,000 grant from the state
Recently, Rhineland-Palatinate's Minister of the Interior, Roger Lewentz, presented a grant cheque for €45,000 to Lahnstein's mayor, Peter Labonte, for the town's volunteer fire service's new water rescue vehicle.
The total cost of the vehicle, which has been in use since November 2020, amounted to €135,000.
A good and important investment in security.
I am delighted that the state of Rhineland-Palatine is supporting us in this," says Lahnstein's mayor Peter Labonte.
The device van is used by the Lahnstein diving team, one of a total of seven units in Rhineland-Palatine.
They carry out tasks both above and below water in water rescue and technical assistance.
Lahnstein is permanently expecting an increase in deployments: the boom in hotel shipping on the Rhine and Mosel, as well as the further increasing use of the Lahn as a leisure river, contribute to this.
I bought a book that I could only read 10% of and then the problems started.
I can't open the book.
However, by following their recommendations, I synced, removed and reloaded the app NOTS worked.
I am a little frustrated because it has taken a lot of time and I am hoping for some help now.
Okay, so it is.
I would like to order 3 articles from the collection of #PRS_ORG# for June.
Can I enter a date during the ordering process?
According to the ANSI/PLATO FL1 standard, the aforementioned values were measured in the Fenix Laboratory at 21°C ± 3°C, 50%-80% relative humidity and with an installed 275mAh LiPo battery.

To make a warranty claim, please contact our warranty department with the following information: name, type/model of the warranty object, serial number.
Thanks firstly for standing up for that, I also spent almost a decade in public service in a similar role, so we were also gun carriers in the executive, I won't go any further into that!
I always find the question of right and left very simply put.
But in principle one should say that the civil servant comes rather from the liberal to conservative spectrum and not from the revolutionary left, that should really be clear to everyone.
Of course, it should be clear to everyone that people in uniform and carrying weapons should also be attracted to the conservative magic of the right, and of course it's clear that these people then have difficulty with the lived reality, because alongside the average white person, there are now many Germans with a migrant background, women and also homosexuals (and by that I don't mean the exaggerated feminine queer cliché, because they are few and far between in the executive, but rather normal men and women who you wouldn't notice were gay if they didn't tell you, and on these people I have to rely, because in the event, they will save your life or put your life
But even these fringe groups represent, in my experience, a conservative attitude, i.e. they are proud of Germany and feel that they are more distanced from Germany by exaggerated left-wing policies, even if these policies are meant to help them or seem to do so. They just want to be treated as normal people.
When it comes to rights, of course the police and armed forces are also a cross-section of society, so one will of course find extreme right-wingers there, but the fact that they are allowed to openly voice their opinion there or even openly hatch any state-threatening plans is totally exaggerated by the media and also annoys me.
Of course it's understandable that even police officers and soldiers, who have often served abroad, often start to generalise and even say things that are controversial and politically incorrect.
It also happens that certain like-minded individuals meet and engage in lively exchange of ideas.
Nevertheless, something like that is well combated by my way of thinking and also counteracted by political education and enlightenment!
Germany is so much intertwined with the international community and in my opinion it is good that we cannot afford to have proper racists and Nazis in our ranks!
yes, what I don't understand, I have also ordered the other basket on the German side.
Why should this come from England?
When I ordered it, it was not sold out.
I ordered it in November.
But it was confirmed to me in your confirmation of the order
It is still about my order, which is no longer available.
I have chatted with #NAME# before.
Alternatively, the other #PRS_ORG# basket for #NUMBER# euros in black could also be delivered to Germany, or this basket is available somewhere in Germany.
I always find you as a partner company.
But on the top edge of the wood there are two deep grooves, filled with something yellow
and there is a small scratch on the mirror itself
Decent through child?
Hello, I (w32) have been occupied with something for a while.
I am very disciplined and organized at work (independent, very little free time), but for as long as I can remember, I have struggled to keep my household clean and tidy.
There are always phases when nothing happens, and then sometimes it grabs me and I tidy up and clean.
But it is not really true that "someone might just drop in for a visit".
My husband (fortunately) isn't any better, it bothers me somewhere, but mostly the household budget simply gives way to work and lack of motivation.
The kitchen is cleaned most regularly as we like to cook there.
Now to my question, have you managed to become more orderly with children?
We don't yet but are working on it and this question has been occupying my mind for a while.
For me I have no motivation, I simply don't like it so much, as long as no-one is coming to visit and for example new clothes are there and the kitchen is usable.
Do you push your child harder or are you negligent?
Looking forward to your answers.
Exclusive, new and qualitatively high-class as well as anatomically pre-shaped cut offers maximum comfort, perfect fit and thus almost unrestricted freedom of movement.
Pre-shaping with a special, further moulding at the joints for improved freedom of movement (on bending the arm and knee joints)
For the Focea Comfort 4, the covered surface area by the Flex System 2 was more than doubled in order to further increase comfort.
Seamless stretch panels on the seams reduce friction (shoulders, arm and knee bends).
High-quality pre-shaping in the lower back area and when walking ensures a snug, perfect seat.
Elaskin 8.8 Stretch-Panel in the lower back area increases flexibility around the zip and improves comfort, especially when bending and when mounting and putting on equipment on the surface.
The free flex zone across the shoulders and lower back guarantees increased flexibility when moving the arms and lower back.
Fireskin is a warm, water-repellent material with a special surface structure that offers a high level of cold protection.
Worn on the chest, it delivers heat to a sensitive area of the body.
Seamless, thin (2 mm) sealing around the face on the bonnet improves comfort, the seal and durability (separate head bonnet).
The soft, collar-type zone improves sealing with a fine-adjustable width setting by a flexible, gentle press stud which does not attach to the trimming or stitching.
Double cuffs with zips on the wrists and ankles connect a foldable inner wristband with a soft, cushioned neoprene outer wristband.
45° notch at the end of the internal cuff for increased elasticity and durability when pulling on it.

Raised edges on the outside cuffs provide greater durability.
Inset seams on the edges for increased flexibility
The original Beuchat system was designed to fix the computer in its place, especially for deeper dives (the system is compatible with all popular wrist computers)
A career in social work - as someone with low self-esteem?
I did a software development training course and have been learning for about a year now.
Unfortunately, I notice more and more that this job is not the right one for me, which is why I have been considering starting again and studying social work.
The problem: I have an avoidant personality disorder (AVPD).
This roughly translates to mean that I have no self-esteem and am accordingly shy.
I have no issues with talking to people at a factual level but small talk is really difficult for me and I have been told many times that I come across as unapproachable (whereas I believe I have got better at this).
Can I become a social worker?
I don't want to work as a street worker or in an open youth centre, but rather in, for example, addiction counselling or family help.
However, I don't know whether the concrete working day is really like I imagine it to be, and it's difficult to find anything about it online.
The ÄVPS is already causing me problems in my current job (for me, emotionally), because it always brings me down when there's something to criticise in my code ("again, it's just the simplest things") and it's hard for me to ask more experienced colleagues for help ("I should really know how that works by now"/"I'm holding up my colleagues with my silly questions about the job"/"he must really think I'm incompetent" etc.).
I will probably have problems like that in every job but I wanted to mention it here.
But have you got your sofa back?
Because there was no confirmation for that either.
I'm waiting for a collection date
What do they mean by give back please!
If I download a book on the #PRS_ORG#, the message I get is "Your #PRS_ORG# does not authorize this book"
Is there a problem?
I was chatting to #PRS_ORG# who asked me if I had received a delivery confirmation for my wardrobe.
The protein the bird takes in with the food is broken down into individual protein building blocks (amino acids) in the bird's gastrointestinal tract and the bird then uses these to build its own body proteins, which it needs for feather formation.
Feather development in the nestling and the formation of new feathers in the moulting bird are extremely complex processes and are particularly demanding for the animal's entire organism.
Please note that NEKTON-Bio must not be administered during breeding since it can interfere with the reproductive process.
In conjunction with this generous gift from NEKTON-Bio, we should return to a daily supply of vitamins with NEKTON-S (multivitamin preparation) and NEKTON-MSA (mineral preparation).

1 g NEKTON-Bio to 250 ml water or 100 g soft food.
It is recommended to prepare only as much drinking water/soft food as the bird consumes daily and to change the water/food daily.
A tapped measuring spoon (inserted) corresponds to 1 g NEKTON-BIO.
In the case of severe feather damage, double or treble the dose of NEKTON-Bio can be given initially, until the approach of feather regeneration is visible.
After that, the normal dose is administered until feather regeneration is complete.
Storage: NEKTON-Bio should be stored dry and out of direct sunlight, between 15° and 25°C.
Please excuse us, but the chair is being sold as an office chair.
How can an office chair be broken after 9 months?
The guarantee period in Germany is 24 months.
That is really very bad service.
Hello, I sent an email on Monday to advise that my order had arrived damaged and to attach images.
Have you received this email?
A statement by a church employee in response to the by-laws
Hello r/LegaladviceGerman,
I have the following problem.
A walnut tree is to be felled in our garden.
A planning application has also been submitted to the municipality.
An employee writes to me that the cutting down of fruit trees and therefore the walnut tree is not part of the statute.
The walnut tree is, however, listed as a protected tree in the by-laws.
Can I now rely on the statement of the employee or not?
On the one hand, I must be able to rely on expert opinions.
On the other hand, the statute is clear.
Thank you for your answers.
We understand.
We will then use this new packaging for it.
I didn't receive a message
Well, then I still have a sofa without using it.
Do you offer a discount or a voucher?
What was more expensive?
Yes, I believe that is correct, the question is whether I can pay in euros and have the blanket delivered to Germany
Can you check that?
Incident: Serious road accident in Selb
Recently, a serious road accident occurred on the St 2179 between the Selb North junction and Plößberg.
As the police press release currently reports (2:03 p.m.), a car came into the oncoming lane while overtaking.
There are casualties.
Ah, I understand.
Good, then many thanks again for it being so simple!
Advice and ideas for further career steps
Merry Christmas to you!
My Christmas was moderately good because my dear head is just thinking of everything one can think of.
Before I open up now, in short: I need advice and preferably from people who know my situation - you.
I am currently doing the ref as a lateral entry.
I originally studied something else and worked in an area related to that (so as to remain anonymous here, I won't be any more specific).
However, it then became too boring for me and so I looked for alternatives that might be more fun.
At some point I landed in teaching and was sure that was it - even if the conditions were much less flexible than my previous job, but that didn't matter.
I have now arrived at the third "I Google other postings".
And it's only halfway through.
Before each fight I used to decide to carry on and at least end the round, then I could always turn things around.
But I am absolutely finished.
I had so little free time last month that I am completely exhausted.
The holidays are here, but there's still a mountain of work waiting for me.
I always thought I was stress-resistant, but there my weekend was also my weekend and my evening my evening.
I was free then.
And the stress of the work was irrelevant in the moment.
Now even the family celebration is too much stress for me.
And then there are these rigid structures that additionally irritate me.
Fundamentally it's good fun and from the outside looking in the replay is good too, as is the feedback.
But I am completely dehydrated and wonder how much stress my body can take before it completely shuts down - if it isn't already.
I wonder whether I want the rest of my working life to be like this - especially when I read some of your contributions - or whether I should go back to the old area, where I felt valued, could take my free time when I needed it, found the work mildly boring but properly remunerated and enjoyed being part of a team rather than, as most of the time now, a lone fighter.
But then I ask myself whether in a year's time I won't have arrived at the same place again, and be dissatisfied.
You realise it's all a bit muddled, but perhaps you, as an outsider, have advice or ideas as to how I can get myself out of this situation, where I start crying at the mere thought of it.
I'm not making decisions now that are based on emotion - that's not likely to lead to anything good.
But maybe your views will help me to see at least a little light at the end of the tunnel - or enjoy Christmas, that's enough for me for now.
Thanks for reading and sorry for the whiny tone from me.
I hope that my situation is at least a little clearer now.
Since its introduction in 2001, VOX's Valvetronix series has undergone continuous development, which has led, among other things, to the combination of cutting-edge modelling technology with the "Valve Reactor" circuit, which perfectly replicates the behaviour of a valve amplifier.
With the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X amps, we are introducing a brand-new modelling engine that is state-of-the-art in terms of sound.
Thanks to VET (Virtual Element Technology) technology, which is based on an analysis of the parts and amplifier circuits, the VTX amplifiers have a level of authenticity that is absolutely impressive.
These amps also of course contain the Valvetronix tube preamp.
This is partly because they use genuine analogue circuits, as these are better at capturing the sound variations and nuances of a valve amplifier than any simulation.
In addition to this sophisticated circuitry, the VTX amplifiers have a closed housing and a bass reflex system that has the natural resonances simply bubbling forth.
With VOX's "Tone Room" software, you can even correct and bend historical facts on the virtual level, so that the amp and effects sound just how you always imagined.
The perfect combination of tube sound with modelling technology is primarily due to the VOX Valve Reactor technology first introduced in 2001.
Naturally, it has since been refined to meet new sound demands, leading in 2010 to another performance boost for the VOX Valvetronix series - with more dynamics and a host of improved amplifier models.
From the user-friendly VT20+ to the VT120+ with two speakers, the new VT+ Valvetronix series has been designed in such a way that every guitarist looking for maximum sound diversity will find what they are looking for here.
All guitarists dream of the pressure and dynamics of a tube amplifier: they expect a fat sound, a nuanced reproduction of playing dynamics and string attack, and prompt response.
During an in-depth analysis, VOX engineers discovered that it is primarily the final stage that determines the tube character of an amplifier, and developed the VOX Valve Reactor technology based on this finding.
The valve reactor circuit of any VT+ amplifier with a 12AX7 tube forms the behaviour, the subtle nuances and the sound character of a valve amplifier perfectly.
NBA: Despite 20 points from Wagner, Magic fall to Clippers
The Orlando Magic's losing streak in the NBA continues.
The Wagner brothers can shine - but it's not enough to win against the Los Angeles Clippers.
Despite 20 points from Franz Wagner and seven assists from older brother Moritz, the Magic fell 104-106 to the Los Angeles Clippers on Saturday.
The large flap is also adaptable: with three individually placed and foldable Velcro fastening parts, it is tailored to suit the needs of your photographic equipment and is thus suitable for all types of cameras - from mirrorless cameras of all sizes through to full-format reflex cameras.
What ultimately fits in the rucksack, of course, depends on the size of the camera and the lens.
A possible configuration would be a DSLR camera with an attached lens, two to three interchangeable lenses and a detachable flash.
Larger DSLM cameras such as Sony's a7 series or the Fujifilm X-T2 still have room for more lenses.
You can also store all sorts of accessories in it.
And if you have a small DSLM camera (MFT cameras from Olympus, Fujifilm X-A or E-series), you can use the rucksack for your equipment and for photo-unrelated things.
The Everyday Backpack 20L is also an ideal choice for drone pilots, as it provides enough space for a DJI Mavic Pro remote control and accessories.
Volcanic eruption on La Palma: longest in history
In the three months since the eruption began, lava flows on the Canary island have caused extensive damage.
Is an end in sight?
Now in its 85th day, the volcanic eruption on La Palma is the longest known in the history of the Spanish Canary Island.
Thus far, the eruption of the Tehuya volcano in 1585, which lasted for 84 days, was the longest on the Atlantic island off the west coast of Africa.
There are no reliable data on previous eruptions.
Activity at the still unnamed volcano in the Cumbre Vieja has lessened over the past few days, but volcanologists did not venture a prediction of when it might end.
The indicators point to a slow-down.
The best news is that they are stable," said the president of the island council, Mariano Hernandez Zapata, to state TV broadcaster RTVE.
Damages in the millions
In the almost three months since the eruption began, the more than 1000 degree hot lava has destroyed almost 2900 homes and other buildings, as reported by RTVE.
Just under 1200 hectares were covered by a meter-thick layer of lava.
This is almost equivalent to 1700 football pitches.
More than 7000 residents had to be evacuated, and the damage is estimated at more than 900 million euros.
Two new land masses totaling around 50 hectares have arisen off the coast through cooled lava.
The island's vital banana industry, which employs around half of the island's 85,000 population directly or indirectly and was already in crisis before the volcanic eruption, was hit particularly hard.
A total of 225 hectares of banana plantations were destroyed and further areas heavily damaged, wrote the newspaper "El País".
Christmas and the presents
Christmas is just around the corner and the children are eagerly looking forward to the celestial festival.
The many colorful gifts under the Christmas tree are connected with the spiritual atmosphere and the fizzing tension something enticing about them.
Christmas is one of the few traditional events that still brings our increasingly divided society together.
It is so much more important to be aware of the tradition of giving at Christmas, so that the gesture of giving, which according to the French sociologist and ethnologist Marcel Mauss is a peace-making "contract of nature peoples", can loosen the shackles of routine and be filled with life in the context of this tradition.
How Saint Nicholas became the Christ Child
In a strict sense, it was the Protestants who closely connected Christmas with gift-giving.
Previously, gifts were given on St. Nicholas Day in one way or another.
The background to this still popular custom is that Saint Nicholas, as Bishop of Myra, threw three bags of gold through a window to save three women from a life of sin.
This unconventional way of giving birthed a popular tradition in Germany of filling shoes, especially for children, with gifts.
Protestants object to this practice because they reject "Saint veneration" as a mediator between God and man.
For these reasons they are wary of the institution.
Martin Luther made the Christ child out of St. Nicholas and thereby established a new tradition.
This shifted the focus of the celebrations to Christmas Eve.
Most Protestants, however, no longer pay such close attention to such details, so it is only a small minority who are irritated that the tradition of St. Nicholas, like that of St. Martin with hymns and a procession, is still such an integral part of the run-up to Christmas.
Today, you will find everything your heart desires – from socks to sought-after luxury watches – in boots outside the door and under the Christmas tree.
Traditions in Christian Countries
Sources document a tradition of gift-giving on the feast day of St. Nicholas since the 13th century.
With the Reformation, the day of giving was moved to Christmas Eve.
However, in all Christian countries, there is great joy and excitement over the question of who will now bring the presents to the children.
In Germany, it varies from region to region as to whether the Christ child appears on Christmas Eve or the Christmas man, who is a kind of Santa Claus, to whom over time certain characteristics have been assigned.
This includes, for example, his white beard, which has little in common with the stricter Assyrian beard of the historical figure, his sleigh, which is pulled by reindeer and his preference for the chimney, in order to gain access to the houses.
In the Netherlands, Saint Nicholas remains the central figure at Christmas.
In Spain, the Three Wise Men give the gifts, while in Italy it is the witch Befana who is said to have shown them the way to the baby Jesus.
In Scandinavia, sometimes mythical creatures bring the gifts, while in Russia, Father Frost achieved some glory.
Here it is not livestock, but three horses pulling the sleigh as a troika.
In the Czech Republic, the motherland of the Reformation during the Hussite Wars, the Christ child is responsible for handing out the gifts.

Police shoot dead suspected bank robber near palace
A man armed with a knife was shot by police near the Kensington Palace in London on Saturday.
Police said callers reported a man walking around with a gun into a bank and a bookmaker's office.
The man fled in a vehicle that was stopped by officers a short time later, according to authorities.
Shots were fired and the man was hit.
He was pronounced dead at the scene.
The police did not assume that a terrorist background was involved.
Numerous embassies have settled in the area around the Kensington Palace.
The palace is the official London residence of Prince William, his wife Kate and their three children.
Other members of the royal family also live there.
Which ones?
No matter where I click, I am immediately redirected to your page.
The decorative light fitting fits harmoniously into every garden, garden area or rock garden.
The light is simply set up and can be anchored into the ground with two earth spikes.
Integrated and high-performance 0.4 watt solar module for optimal charging of the built-in battery.
Maximum light duration: 10 hours.
The robust plastic construction can be used outdoors all year round.
In the Hollywood show, they are usually threatening objects from distant galaxies, which internally glow in colour.
In comparison, "Smart Stone" is completely harmless: the sun alone ensures that this solar light radiates fascinatingly – in white or coloured light (in six different colour tones).
The seamless, amorphous design is consciously chosen: like a naturally formed large pebble, this modern light object presents itself during the day.
Its organic rounded forms are suitable for every natural environment – whether on the edge of a terrace, in the grass or in a rockery.
He also does well for himself in the company of larger pebbles and boulders, where his size enables him to hold his own.
You can save yourself a lot of hard work: "Smart Stone" does not require an electrical connection or batteries - it is a solar light.
Place the "milestone" in a popular, sunny spot during the day.
Two supplied earth spikes provide a secure fixing as required.
The matt-white plastic case itself is robust and weather-resistant.
Its solar module conceals "Smart Stone" discreetly within it, along with its battery and two LEDs - one for white light and the other for coloured light.
The battery is already charging when sunlight falls on the housing.
As dusk falls, «Smart Stone» begins to glow automatically; in what colour, you decide: a total of six attractive light colours are available to you – in addition to daylight white.
Shutdown also occurs automatically once the battery level falls below a predetermined minimum or light levels return.
Once the sun comes out, the charging cycle begins on the next day.
I have tried this several times, it has not worked.
Shame, I would have liked to have carried on shopping with you, but if I can't use the voucher, then I won't be ordering again out of principle.

The LocoSound 5 motor control system has also been completely revised.
A variable PWM frequency between 10kHz and 50kHz ensures particularly quiet operation with bell-anker motors – the characteristic "buzzing" is a thing of the past.
The load regulation can now be adjusted to accommodate up to 10 CVs, even for difficult cases.
The unique "Auto-tune" function allows the decoder to be automatically tuned to the motor.
The LokSound 5 decoder delivers up to 1.5A motor current, which is enough for older motors as well.

Tablet problem
Hello dear women
I hope I'm doing this right, it's actually my first post on reddit after a year.
My problem: I reluctantly started taking the pill about five years ago, mainly because I was experiencing such horrific pain during my period and PMS leading up to it.
Now I would like to leave it at that, because I already have to take enough medication for chronic illnesses that I can't choose.
My main problem, surprisingly not the pain, but my skin.
I had an explosive outbreak of pimples when I went from 0 to 100 and they were everywhere
As shallow as that, but it did weigh on me and I didn't feel good.
During the two years off, nothing really normalised.
Maybe someone has some tips on how to avoid this happening.
My cosmetics are already perfume-free and unscented, but maybe there's something you can recommend to me.
The gynaecologist didn't take me seriously and I've still got an appointment with a dermatologist.
Many, many thanks to everyone who has read the novel!
Yes, the love of skin is such a thing.
Had really bad neurodermatitis, then a period of rest, then large-scale cysts and acne.
In terms of diet, I've tried everything with Christian's illness, and have ended up surviving on a diet of sugar, milk and meat because nothing else works properly.
It can also be good that the hormone is simply inside the worm, but when one wants to have building sites everywhere like I do, one prefers not to look for anything that might go wrong.
I had already done everything their colleague semina o.ä.
written and now I've lost the conversation and don't know what was said in response to my question.
I had to keep working in between and suddenly everything was gone...
what is there to check when the money is there, I would have seen it
Please check my bank details, there may have been an error

2 x 110kV underground cables are to be built in 2022
The approval for the laying of the new high-voltage cable in Tann is now legally binding.
The government of Lower Bavaria's planning approval decision paves the way for construction to begin in 2022.
This was announced by network operator Bayernwerk.
The underground cable, measuring around seven kilometres in length, will connect the Tann substation in the north of the community and the existing 110-kilovolt line between Simbach and Pfarrkirchen.
The cable is connected to a pylon in the region of Edermanning near Reut.
Good morning.
My order from 03.01.21 with the order number #NUMBER# has only arrived in part with us so far.

Lesson planning (EK)
Hello dear colleagues,
I have been in the ref since summer, I enjoy teaching, but at the moment I have a big problem planning my lessons in geography efficiently.
Unfortunately, my school is not well-equipped with technology, so in principle I can only use the board, the textbook and an OHP as media.
In school I can only photocopy in black and white for free (which is annoying for geography).
Currently, I simply need a very long time to plan my hours.
For example, at the moment we are dealing with the topic of geographic factors, and with me every hour is really a different story.
In principle, the methods always repeat themselves, but on the other hand, I don't want to invest too much time in simple lesson plans (which I need for UBs etc.).
I always plan lessons based on the learning objectives (what do I want to achieve) and then I think about how I can build on that (mostly I create a worksheet with texts from books that my school doesn't have).
We have the book Terra and with most of the tasks in the book I am rather dissatisfied.
So the working sheets too.
Maybe a geography teacher could show me how to work efficiently with the book.
That would really make me happy.
I would like to return the #PRS_ORG# from order #NUMBER#.
I have actually already decided on a new one with #PRS_ORG#, but I would like to return it as soon as possible.
Trade fears Christmas could be hit by 2G ruling
Most businesses can only be entered by those who are vaccinated or have recovered.
The trade considers this to be unnecessary and laments a drop in profits.
He also has a possible solution.
The 2G rulings are harmful to retail, according to the Federation of German Trade (HDE).
HDE managing director, Stefan Genth, criticised the fact that sales were down for non-essential items.
According to a recent survey of 1100 retailers by HDE, more than 70 per cent of companies viewed the remaining days of the year negatively.
Many had already written off Christmas business.
What was actually the positive highlight of the year is now often a bottomless pit, said Genth.
According to this, dealers with 2G access restrictions lost almost a third of their pre-crisis turnover in the past week.
Things are only going well in food retail and online.
The Association is demanding consequences from the dramatic development.
Shopping with masks, keeping a distance and hygiene concepts is a safe matter, said the managing director.
Buying 2G won't help us in the fight against the pandemic," he stressed.
The current regulations are a deterrent to customers and require a high level of personal input.
The regulations for these bands must be nationally approved, he demanded.
After that each customer must be tested only once for 2G (vaccinated or recovered) and will be issued with a band on that day giving them access to all premises.
In addition, in retail – as in local public transport with the 3G rule (vaccinated, recovered or tested) – sample controls should be sufficient.
Property company Deutsche Euroshop, which specialises in shopping centres, also reported a difficult Christmas.
The frequencies are currently at 75 percent of the pre-coronavirus level without 2G, with turnover at around 90 percent.
These figures will certainly fall during the all-important Christmas trading period," managing director Wilhelm Wellner told "Wirtschaftswoche" (Economy Week).
Due to the high level of personal and administrative expense, attempts are being made to find solutions and have them approved for the centres.
This is to include so-called wristband solution, where "visitors, for example, once prove their 2G connection at a central point in the centre once, and then - equipped with an armband similar to a club hotel - can enter all the shops without being disturbed". dpa
I recently ordered and received the #PRS_ORG#.
The mirror has a scratch and there is also a fault on the frame, which is attempted to be covered up with a yellow filler.
It looks bad.
I would be very happy to return the mirror and have already repacked it and taped it back up.
How do I proceed with the return now?
The lamp is constructed for dual balance, based on new, flat SMD - LEDs with high power and high colour rendering.
A modern microprocessor with exceptional possibilities is used to set the colour temperature and brightness of the lamp.
In addition to adjusting brightness, there are two standard colour temperatures: daylight and artificial light.
It is also possible to set the color temperature in the range of 3100 - 5650K manually and save it.
Take advantage of the current settings in the flash memory.
A particular feature of the controller; it is simple and easy to operate.
The light produces a very high light flow with soft, high-quality light, completely free of flicker.
The 120-degree viewing angle means that you can illuminate large areas with a relatively small distance, which is great.
In any case, this also applies to reporter situations in small rooms or short distances.
You can adjust the brightness without changing the colour temperature.
It's a fantastic tool to work with both on set or in the studio.
The optional DMX512 controller allows the light to be remote-controlled in television studios or when the light is mounted in inaccessible places.
On the back of the light is the control panel, consisting of buttons and a glowing display.
The display shows the current brightness setting as a percentage and the current colour temperature in Kelvin.
There is also a slot for the NP-F batteries (not included in delivery).
User memory The memory has up to three panel settings for brightness and colour temperature.
To access the individual settings in the memory places, you simply hold down one of the memory buttons for longer.
The storage controller saves the current state of the lamp when it is switched off, so that when it is switched on again, the known situation is restored - very practical when working in the studio, for example, when the camera is set to specific colour temperatures.
Working with batteries is one of the DL3120's biggest strengths, as it allows you to use cheap NP-F batteries.
These are often already in the possession of photographers and camera operators (and women) - so you can use existing equipment.
The DL3120 can also check before setting whether the batteries have enough power – it has a built-in battery tester – for each of the two battery compartments, a value is displayed in both display windows (the upper display for the left battery, the lower one for the right).
In addition, it is of course possible to supply the headlights continuously with power via the delivered charger.
The construction of the headlight is very simple.
To fix it, they have a 16mm mount as the interface, so you can connect it directly to your tripod.
The inclination is set reliably by sensors on both sides.
It was noted that the mechanical components are also extremely high-quality and, as a result, designed for longevity and hard use.
It also includes a swivel joint in the delivery.
What is also great is that a bag is also included in the delivery.
This allows you to transport or store the light with all the accessories you might want to buy without any problems.
Shame, I got given it and it's too small :(
The party that we wanted to throw: Frankfurt celebrates after a torrid comeback against Leverkusen
What a spectacular reaction from Eintracht Frankfurt.
After 22 minutes, the Hesse team, who had lost their last two matches in series, were seemingly on the way to their next Bundesliga defeat.
Yet SGE then turned it around, and within a good hour had banished the frustration of a mixed start to the season by winning 5:2. "It is crazy what the lads have achieved today," jubilant coach Oliver Glasner said on DAZN, and he gave "special praise to everyone who was there."
At first it looked as if it would be another disappointment for the Frankfurt team, now in ninth place and still not meeting expectations.
Patrik Schick put Leverkusen 2-0 up in front.
What happened next even impressed the SGE coach.
The way the players have come back and shown a fantastic performance," continued Glasner.
I'm absolutely delighted with the performance we've shown and, of course, with the result.
Even defender Christopher Lenz, who was able to take to the field for the first time since the fourth match day and his muscle injury, emphasised the morale of his team mates.
I think our mentality was incredible," said the 27-year-old, smiling at the final score in particular for the fans.
That was the message we wanted to give today.
Glasner, however, wants to keep the focus for the upcoming tasks, and feels well-prepared in terms of the personal situation.
It is unusual that we have all players fit in December, that all players are in top physical condition.
It's top work in our medical department, but the players live professionally, too.
Now they want to "continue step by step and stay humble" and complete the tasks until the end of the year "at this level".
In addition, on Wednesday, as part of the English week, there is an away game at Borussia Mönchengladbach (7.30pm, Sky).
I will receive the mail that my parcel is being returned to you due to an error on my part.
I've tried calling #PRS_ORG# and redirecting it, no joy.
Can it be sent directly to me again or do I have to wait for the money to be refunded and then reorder?
This would mean for me unfortunately that I will not order again because it has taken such a long time.
Have they sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs yet?
Shock for German women's handball team ahead of quarter final against Spain
Germany's handball women slunk off the court with their heads hanging after the drubbing from Denmark.
At the end of the main round of the World Championship, the German National team suffered a bitter defeat of 16:32 (8:13) in front of 800 spectators in Granollers and will now have to face the host country, Spain, in the quarter finals.
We were too nervous and had too much respect for our opponents, pronounced national coach Henk Groener.
We must perform differently against Spain.
After the first defeat in the tournament, Germany finished Group III in the main round with 8:2 points, taking second place behind the Danish team (10:0).
It is a shame we could not take the flow with us.
That was a bad game which we must erase from our memories," captain Emily Bölk said.
A significant step up is required if they are to make the semi-finals next Tuesday against the 2019 runners-up, to keep alive the fragile dream of a first medal since 2007.
Best German scorer in the duel with three-time Olympic champion Denmark was right-back Alina Grijseels with six goals.
We were simply not there - whether in attack or in defence, right-back Xenia Smits admitted, and demanded: "We must now look forward quickly".
Not on top from front to back
Unlike in the previous five matches, the German team did not start off well.
Missed shots and technical errors in the attack and gaps in the defence were responsible for a quick 0:4 lead after seven minutes.
Only goalkeeper Dinah Eckerle was immediately on top form and prevented worse with some saves.
The first goal for the DHB team came after 9:30 minutes when Grijseels successfully completed a quick counter-attack.
The expected spark, however, was not forthcoming.
Against the aggressive Danish coverage, the German women had great difficulty getting into the game - and when they did, they usually came up against the strong Althea Reinhardt in the goal of the Scandinavians.
The match therefore ended prematurely after 20 minutes with the score at 3:10, not least because, just a few minutes later, defender Mia Zschocke saw red for a hard foul against her opponent.
However, she will be allowed to take part in the quarter finals.
It was only in the final stages of the first half that the German National team improved and they managed to reduce the deficit to five goals by half time.
In any case, any faint hope of a comeback after the change was extinguished after just seven minutes, when the score was 9:19.
Once again, the young Greens failed in all areas and made it easy for their well-prepared opponents, who are among the medals at the end of the tournament.
As a result the German team could no longer raise their game and left the stage as clear losers.

The title suggests that I work as a vaccine specialist in mobile vaccination teams, in which (to date) only the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine is given, above all in care homes.
As these will soon be finished, they will in part move on to vaccine centres for me.
I am happy to answer time-unlimited questions on the organisational and human aspects as well as medical questions, provided that these are not personal (e.g. "I take medication X, is that compatible with the vaccine...").
Within my remit are providing information about the vaccine, the indications for vaccination (i.e. people are entitled to a vaccination under the Coronaimpfve order and have no grounds for refusal), medical documentation and, if necessary, emergency treatment for allergic reactions (which has never happened to me).
The vaccination itself can be delegated to qualified personnel, for example, medical assistants.
In vaccine teams, however, we usually don't have any of those, but rather "only" (please no lack of appreciation!) pharmaceutical technical assistants for the preparation of the vaccine, who cannot (are not allowed to?) carry out the injections themselves, so that I have to give most of the injections myself.
Serious "Huidlerer" question: Amberg knows the solution
What is a "Huidlerer"?
With this dialect word, sent in by an Amberger, thought-provoking reflections have been caused by the BR television programme "Wir in Bayern".
However, unlike on many previous days, the term "Host mi?" this time remained unheard from the callers in the series.
No, it wasn't "a man who is nervous".
And nor is anyone "in a rush".
This, people heard from the TV presenter, is completely false.
The man from Amberg communicated the solution and thus caused surprise among many Upper Palatinians.
The "Huidlerer", the audience learned, "is a cloth that one uses to wipe the oven clean".
Linguist Antony Rowley, for years a expert consulted by Bavarian Television, confirmed this.
With the note that this is a typically Upper Palatinate term, derived somehow from the better-known dialect word "Houdern".
Thus filling a skills gap – and for a number of people who have lived in the Amberg region for a long time.
I haven't been able to buy books for two weeks.
After the confirmation, the following error message always appears: oops - something went wrong - try again later.
I have restarted the #PRS_ORG#, reconnected it to the PC, synchronized and repaired it.
Nothing helped.
Wheel choice for racing bike- really that safe?
This morning, I woke up raring to go because I wanted to at least do a little training for my bike tour next week.
Said, done, and I set off on my racing bike which I bought on eBay yesterday.
The first 40km were also really nice - but then it happened, what awaits you in every town centre (this time: thanks, Krefeld!).
Glassplitter on the course.
Zack, his loud snoring and my back tyre meant that the rest of the route was out of the question.
As I had no chance of getting hold of a replacement coat and hood due to it being a weekday, I had to turn back and take the first bus home in a somewhat bad mood.
And if the war didn't go quite so badly, it might be better if I practised changing the tyre before the bike ride.
However, I now face a question and I hope you can help me.
As I have a relatively long distance to cover over several days, I would really rather not get this problem often.
It wasn't that bad now, as the old tyres from the previous owner (a very nice old man, who had ridden 140km the day before I collected the bike) were also suboptimal, as he had been riding on them for many years.
However, if I think that I have to change a tyre when driving at 80-90kms, then I am really in a bad mood:D
Now I am chatting to an older man by the platform about my lack of Marathon Plus tyres, which are supposed to be puncture-proof.
The whole thing sounds very tempting now, of course.
But are they really that unbreakable?
I have little desire to spend €40/tyre now, only to be disappointed later.
Furthermore, I ask myself: at the moment I believe I weigh 25x622 on my racing bike.
That is true (apparently?) of the Marathon Plus tyres, but the majority is already wider.
Is this a problem?
Or would you generally advise me to go for different tyres on a racing bike?
The Swallow side seems to be my absolute! I would rather recommend the Durano DD?
Thanks in advance for the help and kind regards!
Car launches against tree: driver fatally injured
The 53-year-old drove his car onto the central reservation on the B57 between Rheinberg and Xanten for unknown reasons, and then crossed over onto the wrong side of the road, according to police.
This resulted in a head-on collision with a vehicle driven by a 27-year-old.
The car belonging to the 53-year-old was then knocked into a tree and the man trapped inside.
The 27-year-old driver and his 23-year-old passenger were seriously injured in the accident and taken to nearby hospitals.

Following the publication of our new high-end broadband B 100-6 OHM, it was only a matter of time before our SOLO series would once more be blessed with offspring.
SOLO 15 is the name of the new offshoot and it looks like the big boys with the B 200 - 6 OHM.
However, this building proposal includes a designed-in footprint to lift the speaker into the correct position.
This has no effect on the acoustics and can therefore be lengthened to suit the circumstances at home.
In principle, the SOLO 15 is very suitable for people for whom the maximum volume is of less importance, but who want to achieve an exceptionally high level of sound.
A 10 cm speaker simply cannot generate such high sound pressure levels without filtering.
However, that does not mean that SOLO 15 sounds weak.
Instead, it has grown considerably, and for its size, it is extremely impressive and precise.
The SOLO 15 was tuned with a slight rise in tone.
This is a common technique with broadband in order to optimise the bundling of the high frequencies.
Exactly on the listening place, the SOLO 15 convinces with a very clear and fine sound.
The high frequencies can be slightly reduced and thus the sound picture made warmer.
Thanks to the point source, the localisation of the individual components of a piece of music within the optimal stereo triangle is sharp and amazingly precise.
The suspicion-arousing extremely low mechanical losses of the B 100 - 6 OHM generate an enemy dynamic that is similar to it.
The SOLO 15 thus not only complements our SOLO series, but also extends its capabilities in terms of resolution and accuracy.
As with all our construction projects, it is advisable to give some thought at the outset to the final appearance of the speaker, so that appropriate changes can be incorporated into the construction plans.
If, for example, the housing is to be veneered, the height of the speaker must be adjusted accordingly, as the veneer adds extra material.
Once all the discs have been cut to size (e.g. at a DIY store), the first step should be to drill a 8mm hole in the floorboard at the appropriate place, so that the cables can be passed through without any problems.
With the help of a surface grinder, the speaker opening in the front is now carried out so that the B 100 - 6 OHM can be inserted flush later.
On the other hand, this opening should be provided with a 45° bevel in order to create as large an opening area as possible for the speaker chassis inside.
The four connection points of the B 100 - 6 OHM have an interruption in the phase, as is shown in the "Detail Phase" image.
After that, one begins the actual construction of the box by placing one of the side walls on a level surface in front of them.
These are now glued to the back, the lid, the front and the bottom.
The three stiffeners should also be fitted and glued in place.
The stiffeners themselves can also vary in terms of their material thickness, depending on whether you want to use finished lengths from the DIY store or make your own from 16mm MDF.
In the next step, the second side will be applied.
This is followed by all the records of the feet, i.e. both sides and the front.
With the help of a suitable drill chuck or a Forestner drill, the installation of the bass reflex resonator openings, as well as the fixing clamp on the back wall, is facilitated.
A round-off saw is then used to round off all the edges of the actual box.
The top surface of the foot plate can also be rounded off in this way.
Next, the base plate is securely glued to the bottom of the housing and additionally screwed down with long wooden screws.
This involves marking and drilling (2.5mm drill-bit) the screw-in points of the speaker chassis and the plug-in connector.
Once the case has been cleaned of dust (vacuum / blow), the cables are laid.
The simplest way to do this is through the 35mm bass reflex opening in the rear wall.
Thus, the entire, uncut cable is pushed piece by piece through the 8 mm drilling in the foot until the terminal opening, and is left to protrude there by around 30 cm.
At the top of the housing, the cable is led to the speaker opening and is also left hanging loose there.
The frequency changer is prepared and used below.
The construction plan for the frequency switch, as well as the corresponding connection plan, can be taken from the following document: Installation instructions Weiche Solo 15.
If the frequency switch has been built-in and the terminal screwed on, the sealing of the 8 mm cable opening inside the box, which is not yet completely closed, follows.
With the 35mm bASSREFLEX aperture and a bit of skill, you can apply hot glue to the aperture and thus seal it.
By opening the B 100 - 6 OHM and using a small torch, it is possible to check the seal accordingly.
And now, the humiliation.
The B 100 - 6 OHM is then connected and secured with the appropriate screws.
The polarity plays an important role here, so that the positive lead (marked cable) must be soldered to the positive speaker terminal (larger contact).
Finally, the bass reflex tube is cut to a length of 28 mm (the total length of the tube) and inserted.
To dampen it, a mat of the damping material is cut into two parts and evenly distributed in the housing.
The opening around the ear canal should be preserved.
Can I abandon an order now and have it delivered in early June?
Hello everyone,
Finally we can announce that we will once again be hosting OSCAST this year!
Unfortunately, due to known reasons, we will not be able to get more than four people into the studio, which means more planning and explains the short notice of the announcement.
But with at least three people on shift we will be live streaming the Oscars 2021 with at least seven beans and hoping to be followed by thousands of you!
We do our best to avoid delays or other problems.
But hey, it's still a pandemic - so we're going to do everything we can to make the Oscars as entertaining as possible.
It will start at around 0:30.
Pour some drinks, plan a good meal, and get ready for a long, but very interesting night.
