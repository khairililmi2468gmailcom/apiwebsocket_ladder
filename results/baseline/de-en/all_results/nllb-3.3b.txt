The goods cost less than 20 euros.
The fee corresponds to 40% of the value of the goods....
I'm a #PRS_ORG# major customer and so it's not a problem for me.
All I need is a number or instructions on what to attach to the package so it can be tracked by you as a return.
I ordered the #PRS_ORG# a few days ago... for $249.
Today it costs $179.
To tell you the truth, I find that very annoying.
Do I have to cancel the order and re-order for the better price or is there another way of credit?
I also believe that children should not be expected to take on the role of parents for their younger siblings.
However, I feel that it is good for older siblings to share in the care of their younger siblings in a measured way.
A quick look, a quick help, bring the bottle, and so on.
It teaches them responsibility, helps them in the family, and involves them.
As long as they can be children themselves, I don't see a problem.
If your K1 is on his own for a little while and he's okay with it, that's good.
You are the best judge of whether this is appropriate for your children.
It's not like he's gonna wrap K2 up and watch him fall asleep for hours.
Legally speaking, it's probably questionable.
Perhaps that explains the psychologist's statement.
Because if something were to actually happen, like a fire, a burglary, an earthquake, an alien invasion, etc., it would actually be too much responsibility for K1 to take care of K2.
Whether that's a risk you're willing to take is, of course, up to you.
Please help me find the title of a book.
I remember reading a crime/thriller a few years ago and I can still remember almost the entire plot, but I can't remember the title anymore, maybe someone here knows...
The story was about fear and how to cure it.
At the beginning of the story, a zookeeper commits suicide by pouring food on himself and joining his predatory cats in the enclosure.
The case is taken over by a police commissioner who, after brief questioning, turns to his therapist who runs a clinic where he treats anxiety patients.
The commissioner has a little niece who's also afraid of fire and ends up with this therapist.
There are more suicides and there's another protagonist -- a photographer who is assigned anonymously before each suicide to go to the site of the suicide and document it and post the photos on the Internet.
Anyway, it turns out that this therapist is running some kind of underground therapy group where patients are implanted with a chip that suppresses an anxiety center in the brain and ultimately allows patients to face their fear in the most extreme way.
(one woman jumps out the window another drives herself to death)
This facing fear is called "the fight" in the book.
At the end there's a big showdown at the clinic that had to do with a fire.
I'm pretty sure the book was originally written by a French author.
If this plot is known to anyone or if anyone can even tell me the title of the book, I would be very happy.
Oh, my God, I don't have the Wi-Fi password.
I have to contact my husband first.
That could take a while.
What steps do I need to take after that?
Is it also possible to get the price difference refunded?
Child, 4 years old, splinter under the thumbnail
Child, four years old, has splinters of wood under the thumbnail (outside) along its entire length.
Tried to pull him with tweezers.
Very hard to reach.
It didn't work and it hurt.
Now the child reacts hysterically when we try.
There's no chance now.
We're going to the doctor tomorrow.

Because of Omicron, Johnson wants to boost booster shots
More and more cases of Omicron are worrying politicians and scientists in the UK.
All eligible adults in England should therefore receive a vaccine offer by the New Year.
London - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to move up the pace of coronavirus booster vaccinations in the face of rapidly rising Omicron numbers.
Every adult in England should have the opportunity to receive a booster dose by the end of the year if at least three months have passed since the second vaccination, Johnson said in a pre-recorded video message to his countrymen on Sunday evening.
So far, the target date has been the end of January.
The UK Government will also provide additional support to speed up vaccination campaigns in parts of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
In the light of the Omicron variant, an emergency is being faced, which is why there is an urgent need to strengthen vaccination protection, Johnson said.
The good news was that the level of protection could be increased again with a third dose of vaccine.
"Get your boosters now!" said Johnson.
On Sunday, 1,239 more Omicron cases were reported in the UK, bringing the total to 3,137.
Compared to the previous day, that was a whopping 65 percent increase.
is the full amount of the purchase price reimbursed at the time of collection?
I'm all for everyone introducing themselves with pronouns
I sent out an application.
Today the invitation to an interview came in the mail.
I want to answer the e-mail.
But unfortunately, the name is not "Peter". It is a somewhat more complicated name.
I googled him, and depending on his/her cultural background, it's either a man or a woman.
I have no idea how to write the e-mail now.
Can someone please help me?
I'm a foreigner and I don't want to step on the feet of an official.
Conclusion: Everyone should introduce themselves with pronouns.
I have a total of five books on it.
4 of them go.
Only the one I bought today doesn't work.
Obviously, the chair had an imperceptible flaw when it was sold.
How else could such cushion damage occur after nine months?
Just tried it on the #PRS_ORG#.
But it's been working for about a year.
Not for another 14 days.
So I used to buy the latest books on the website and then read them on the #PRS_ORG#.
I bought 6 #PRS_ORG# and wanted to buy 8.
However, there were no more.
Now that they're available again, I'd like you to please add two chairs to the order and charge me for them.
[CW] The feeling when I can't help.
Content Warning: I'm going to write a little bit in detail about domestic violence here.
I just need to write about my soul.
I (21) come into contact with the victims (and perpetrators) of domestic violence more frequently for professional reasons.
One of the themes that really gnaws at me, and unfortunately it's all too common, is that many victims don't want to be helped, or think we can't help them.
I'm very aware that we can't do everything, and it's not perfect.
But there are few things in my profession that move me more than when I can't do anything in situations like this.
I see the bruises, the blood, the desperate eyes...
But even in private, with the perpetrator out of sight and sound, I can't reach everyone.
I don't know what the reason is, maybe it's fear, fear of revenge, fear of leaving the familiar social environment, fear of ripping the children out of it.
What I always want to make clear to everyone, sometimes even very close to tears, is that everyone deserves to be able to live without violence.
I want all women to know that they don't have to put up with violence.
Often I wish I could help in any way... I know I can't.
It doesn't make it any easier.
Please, always remember that you deserve to live without violence, that's so incredibly important.
"Arcane" on Netflix: What does the series have to do with "League of Legends"?
Lots of fantasy, lots of complicated names, a stunning presentation: "Arcane", the series from the "League of Legends" computer game universe, recently launched on Netflix.
Why are we looking forward to the two seasons already announced?
Basketball Bundesliga: Derby debacle of the MHP Giants Ludwigsburg with the Merlins Crailsheim
At least Youngster John Patrick was reliable.
Again, nothing: for the second time in less than three months, the Giants lost at Crailsheim - and how!
Before the game, Ludwigsburg's coach John Patrick had said, looking back on the Cup defeat at the beginning of October at the Hakro Merlins Crailsheim: "We still have some anger in our stomachs".
However, it did not recover after the game - but increased again in view of the 61:72 (28:38) defeat in the Basketball-Bundesliga.
But even more disappointing than the naked result was the manner in which it was performed.
As a substitute, here is a statistic that illustrates the whole dilemma: The three-point ratio was just 13 percent, 4 hits (all by young Johannes Patrick) in 31 attempts - any questions?
The answer came from John Patrick: "After the victory at Tenerife, we just weren't focused enough and didn't put into practice what we had trained for".
Moving the ball.
His reaction to Sebastian Gleim was very different: "To win a great game for the second time against Ludwigsburg", said the lucky coach.
"It felt like I was in front of 10,000 people".
Only 750 visitors were allowed into the Hohenlohe Arena on Saturday, but they had to pay for it.
Not least because of BBL leading scorer T.J. Shorts, who scored 22 points and led his team in scoring.
"He's the best playmaker I ever coached", Gleim said.
Whereas on Patrick's team, even top performers like Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7) failed all the way.
Only in the final quarter (22:15) did the Giants prevent a total debacle and come up to eight points after already being 39:59 behind.
In addition to Johannes Patrick, Justin Simon also scored 12 points.
Fortunately, there's not much time left to argue.
Already on Wednesday (19 o'clock) the giants receive the Skyliners Frankfurt, before then also in Ludwigsburg a maximum of 750 spectators.
We used to have a different e-mail address, but I changed it.
Yeah, I signed up a few months ago.
Unfortunately, all warranty claims were denied.
We re-examined the law and therefore wrote to you again.
We originally signed up six months ago.
Max Raabe is turning 59
He is able to thrill his audience with reinterpretations of hit songs from the 20s and 30s.
He's currently on the road with "Good Morning, Good Luck" - if he's allowed to perform.
Actually, Max Raabe would have wanted to celebrate his birthday on the stage in Leipzig this Sunday.
But it's not going to happen.
The planned concert has been postponed to May 2022 - "on official instructions" to contain the corona virus.
Other concerts planned for the Advent season will also have to be postponed, as stated on the website of the singer, who turns 59 today, and his musicians (www.palast-orchester.de).
From January, the artists then want to catch up with their 2020 dates already postponed due to the pandemic.
Born on December 12, 1962 in Lünen, North Rhine-Westphalia, Max Raabe has been singing since he was a teenager.
In Berlin he studied opera singing, and in 1986 he founded the Palast Orchester together with fellow students.
Since then, the baritone has established itself with its repertoire of hits and songs in the style of the Comedian Harmonists.
He was awarded many prizes.
His live album from the "MTV Unplugged" series (2019) - just like his successful album "Für Frauen ist das kein Problem" (2013) - reached the second place of the charts.
He's made it from the niche to the mainstream.
Always elegantly dressed, his blond hair carefully combed back and attentive to etiquette, Max Raabe is indispensable in the current German-speaking music scene.
With the program "Guten Tag, liebes Glück" he has been on tour since 2020. dpa
Hello #NAME#, is it also possible to get a small sample of the furniture wood in advance?
It can be complemented with existing furniture and so we could check beforehand whether it matches the colour
It still doesn't work. I can only crave the cover, but I can't scroll.
Federal Minister of Construction Klara Geywitz: Expropriation does not create new housing
The new Federal Minister for Construction, Klara Geywitz (SPD), has spoken out against the expropriation of large housing groups, as demanded in a referendum in Berlin.
"Expropriation does not create a single new apartment, it only changes the ownership structure", Geywitz said in an interview with the "Tagesspiegel" (Sunday).
My goal is to give tenants the assurance that their rent will remain affordable for years to come.
A diverse mix of private landlords, cooperatives or housing associations, for example, is the best protection against monopoly formation.
In Berlin, the coalition of the SPD, the Greens and the Left Party wants to set up a commission of experts on how to deal with the result of the referendum.
However, if the situation does not ease, Geywitz did not rule out talks with the FDP in the Ampel coalition about further tightening of the rental law.
The coalition agreement provides for a rental price brake until 2029, limiting rent increases in tense housing markets and expanding the rental level.
I'll talk to the Attorney General and get it done as soon as possible.
If the rental market still does not relax, "we will talk to the coalition partners about further steps", the SPD politician stressed.
Hi, I was going to order something and after a few days I noticed that I forgot the last step in the payment.
Unfortunately, the product is no longer available.
Do you know when it 'll be back in stock?
Or will it ever come again?
#PRS_ORG# with storage space (180 x #NUMBER# cm),
Coupon sounds great.
Then I'll redeem it myself at the next order.
Thank you for the quick clarification.
If the lamp is shipped in March, how long will the shipment take?
I've already cut my finger.
This is an absolute shamelessness.
At least 100 killed by tornadoes in Kentucky
In a devastating storm system, numerous tornadoes have swept across the United States.
In Kentucky alone, there could be more than 100 deaths.
The images from there are reminiscent of a war zone.
On Saturday night, tornadoes swept across the United States, wreaking havoc and possibly killing up to a hundred people.
The storms leave behind a 200-mile [320 km] swath of devastation, mostly in the state of Kentucky.
Its governor, Andy Beshear, said after a visit to the disaster area that wherever the tornado passed through, everything was gone.
Houses, businesses, government buildings - just gone.
Parts of industrial plants, roofs are in the trees.
It's hard to imagine that that's even possible.
He's estimating up to 100 deaths in the state of Kentucky alone, and the official numbers are rising by the hour.
Hi, I just saw that it's sold out.
That's too bad.
Is it still in production?
Or has it been removed from the assortment altogether?
Is it possible to order this display case in another country?
When will you be in touch?
If the delivery can't be made to my apartment, I'll have to cancel the order!
I understand that, but can I order the blanket now and have it delivered to Germany, which is in the shopping cart?
I had returned an article via the contact form and wanted to ask if it had arrived or was being processed, as I had not yet received any confirmation.
Companies pay vaccine premiums and change advertising claims
While the Federal Government continues to reject the proposals for a vaccination premium, companies in Austria have taken the initiative themselves and are offering their employees cash bonuses for vaccination.
In doing so, they are in line with the social partners ÖGB and the Chamber of Commerce, which today called for financial incentives for vaccination.
Also, the transformation of advertising slogans into calls for vaccination - following the German model - is intended to increase the willingness to vaccinate against corona.
He's transferred to a company he's been slandering.
That doesn't make his situation any better than yours.
Waiting and drinking tea.
It's been a year.
He obviously didn't stick to his old job and went looking for something else.
You may as well.
And that he didn't like you back then, whatever.
He didn't like his job either.
There are too many variables.
Please record the cancellation.
That will be legally relevant.
I'll take a screen shot.
Hello, I'm interested in the Boone dining room table, white.
Do you have it in a 230-centimeter size?
In our online shop kitchenpoint.de, we list all Smeg kitchen appliances and the corresponding accessories.
We generally check the quality and completeness of your order.
Smeg's new fully automatic coffee machine brings freshly ground coffee to your kitchen or office.

Help with your first campaign
Boron to the gravel!
I'm currently directing the Over the Grapevine adventure for a group of four friends, and I'd like to bring my heroes seamlessly into a campaign written specifically for the players.
We're playing DSA 5.
The big arc is done, the villains and their motivations are written, the individual acts are thought out and now I'm in the middle of writing the opening adventure and stumbling over my own feet from the very first encounter.
The premise is that the heroes are to take a wagonload of grain from Gratenfels to a small village near Lake Thuran.
That's where the rest of the action is supposed to take place.
A few miles from the village, a group of goblins ambush the heroes and lure them into an ambush.
I want to give the player characters the ability to solve the confrontation in different ways: convince, act, threaten, detect the danger early, whatever the players can think of.
Group size: 8 ordinary goblins, 2 armed with spears, 6 armed with bows and swords
When unnoticed, the goblins ambush the hero in a hollow road and flank the vehicle with three arrows each to the left and right, while two with spears stop the vehicle.
If it comes to battle and the heroes are defeated, I have two solutions.
The heroes are all knocked unconscious and subsequently found and healed by the village shoulder's son, a half-elf.
The cart is gone, of course.
2. If defeat is inevitable, this half-elf intervenes with two of his servants and comes to the hero's aid in battle.
The cart's still there, everything's great.
How appropriate do you find the Deus ex Machina of solution 2?
Is the Encounter too much of an introduction to adventure?
The group of goblins will play a crucial role later on, so it's not just cannon fodder.
EDIT: Wow, I wasn't expecting so many responses, especially not so many great suggestions and tips.
I'm sure I'll take a lot of your ideas to heart, and now I have even more faith in my narrative.
I took the lamp apart again.
And put it back together.
Unfortunately, it still doesn't work.
That's why I 'd like to send her back anyway.
Then can you send the return receipts, so I can pack the lamp and bring it to #PRS_ORG#.

Suddenly, there was a crack.
I just sat on it.
Here was the bottom part, so basically the part with storage damaged.
Will they be collecting everything or just the storage part?
I'm annoyed with Sky Sport F1.
Hello dear F1 fans, over the season the quality on the German sky has decreased more and more, so I want to get some air with this post.
First of all, the broadcast was interrupted today in the middle of the F2 race to allow the F1 preview to begin on time.
Although the schedule was far behind the schedule due to the delayed start and the start accident, the last (planned) ten minutes and the championship decision (!) could still have been shown.
However, it seems that for legal reasons F1 has priority and therefore has to limit everything else, so that Sky DE had no choice here.
Still stupid, especially since Sky UK broadcast the end of the race.
Nevertheless, a small compliment: the commentator Olivier Zwartyes has accompanied the difficult situation surrounding the serious accident well.
Then there was in F1 again ignorance of the rules with the commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, so both did not know that you can change the tires under a red flag.
Although this situation had already occurred at Imola, Baku and Silverstone this year, it was only when there were corresponding radio messages on the subject to Hamilton that both came to the conclusion that Verstappen should be allowed to change the tyres.
At Sky UK and RTL, both commentators knew immediately that this possibility existed for Verstappen.
I think it's the kind of basic rules you should know when you're commenting on F1 on a pay-TV channel.
It's also not the first guessing puzzle, which is either allowed or required by the rules, both of which just have constant uncertainties about the rules.
In general, I don't like Roos' elaborate style of commentary, but you have to admit it's a matter of taste.
But seriously, I like even Heiko Wasser from RTL better.
And then there's the constant nonsense that makes them both look unprofessional, like ordering coffee from the (also clueless) reporter Peter Hardenacke or "UuuuuHD" by Ralf Schumacher.
It is precisely the latter who brings a great deal of uneasiness to the comment, which he does not seem to take seriously.
Last but not least, the commercials just take over on Sky, in the final round Sky is the only channel that goes into the commercials, as you can hear on F1TV because only the German soundtrack has to go without comment right after the race.
Neither ServusTV nor ORF is doing this.
Also, these two channels do less advertising in training than Sky, and that as a free TV channel.
Glock and Baumgartner are to be commended for their work, but that alone does not make me overlook the disadvantages.
The rest of Sky Sport F1's programme is also very sparse and full of repetition.
Overall, Sky really is the worst German-language channel to broadcast F1.
Ironically, RTL is doing a better job with the four races they are still allowed to broadcast, except for the advertising.
Anyway, the grand F1 season is a lot less fun than it would be with a reasonable broadcaster.
I'd be interested in your opinion.
On this one: #PRS_ORG# pendulum lights, brass and multicolored glass x 1
Hi, I have an item that was supposed to be delivered last week and it still hasn't been delivered.
I've contacted the chat room twice and so far nothing.
The first lady told me it would be sent on Monday, the second lady told me yesterday that she would check and send an e-mail and she never responded.
Hi, I ordered two #PRS_ORG# on 12/19.
One of them showed a defect after a relatively short time (the fabric has a hole in the front part of the chair).
I'm calling for backup.
Ventilator pumps are ideal for supplying an aquarium with additional oxygen.
It is also possible to operate a filter system by means of air levers.
This series is offered by us in three variants.
Look at the chart at the end of the quote.
There you can see the performance comparisons.
If the pumps are strong enough, they can power entire plants.
If you have a large aquarium, pumps with two or more outputs are suitable so that you can connect several outlets.
The MK series has one, two or four outputs, depending on the model of fan pump, but are also suitable for setting an accent in the aquarium, e.g. with an air curtain (you can find it in our shop) or with a decor that converts the air bubbles into a function.
You could call this a treasure chest or a seashell or something.
The MK series has a special, soundproof construction and thus ensures low operating noise.
The installation is very simple.
The fan pump is connected by means of an air hose 4/6 mm to an outlet or similar... and it can start.
The fan pump should be at or above the water level and installed on the outside.
If the fan pump is lower than the water level, a check valve should be inserted.
Just cut the air hose and put the valve in between.
This would prevent, once the water was running backwards, the water from the pool running through the pump...
If the fan pump is to be installed outdoors, it should, like other air pumps, be covered and protected from moisture
The pumps of the MK series are pure power packages that consume little energy
Even though we put the processing time here on eBay at three days, it's packed every day and the packages are picked up here every day.
If things go well on the road, it's very fast.
We just want to take a little precaution so that no one is offended just because it took a little longer once.
It would be like this, not everyone has sympathy for all the employees who also work in the shipping industry...of course, Corona does not stop here.
Please don't rate me badly just because the delivery is delayed, that's entirely due to the parcel services.
Of course, people like to complain about these services, although at the moment we're saying...they're having a hell of a time.
This also varies greatly from region to region.
Don't be mean to anyone, stay healthy, and we all hope for better times to come.
How long does it take to order the yellow ones with and without armrests?
Can you order the legs in light here, too?
Amazon founder Bezo sends astronaut daughter and host to space
The daughter of the first American in space, a TV host and four other passengers have taken a short trip into space.
They were transported on Saturday by the New Shepard rocket system from Blue Origin, the company owned by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.
The takeoff and landing of the approximately ten-minute flight took place in the western U.S. state of Texas.
Under bright blue skies, Bezos personally greeted the newly minted astronauts upon their return.
"Welcome back", said Bezos, dressed in a blue spacesuit, as he opened the hatch to the capsule.
To the applause of friends, family, and Blue Origin employees, the six passengers slowly climbed out and embraced the Amazon founder.
According to Blue Origin, they flew for ten minutes and 13 seconds, reaching an altitude of 107 kilometers.
The 74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of Alan Shepard (1923-1998), who flew into space as a NASA astronaut in 1961, after whom the Blue Origin rocket system is named, and the 50-year-old TV host Michael Strahan were guests of honor of the company, who had paid for their tickets to four other passengers: space engineer Dylan Taylor, investor Evan Dick, technology entrepreneur Lane Bess and his son Cameron.
Blue Origin did not disclose how much they each paid for their ticket.
Laura Shepard Churchley recalled her father's mission after the short flight.
He had to work hard on his missions and do everything himself.
The 74-year-old said with a laugh that she had just flown along.
Michael Strahan also spoke enthusiastically.
The presenter said that he would like to return to space right away.
The New Shepard flies up to 60 miles [100 km]
The New Shepard missile system is largely automated.
Separated from the rocket in flight, the capsule reached an altitude of about 60 miles [100 km] above the earth, temporarily in zero gravity, before the reusable object was slowed down by large parachutes and landed again.
The International Air Transport Association and many other experts consider 100 kilometers above the earth to be the boundary to outer space, but there is no binding international regulation.
It was Blue Origin's third manned all-excursion: the first in July, Amazon founder Bezos himself was on board, along with his brother Mark, an 82-year-old former U.S. pilot, and an 18-year-old Dutchman.
The second in October was attended by 90-year-old Canadian actor William Shatner, who became world famous for his role as "Captain Kirk" in "Star Trek", as well as former NASA engineer Chris Boshuizen, entrepreneur Glen de Vries and Blue Origin's deputy CEO Audrey Powers.
Critics accuse Bezos and Blue Origin of promoting the business of space tourism largely without scientific research interests for the benefit of humanity and without regard for the climate.

Someone who works in biochemistry or has studied biochemistry
I am currently studying biochemistry in the first semester and I find the subject itself quite exciting and I do not mind standing in the laboratory (I have already completed the inorganic chemistry internship).
Of course, I also informed myself about career prospects before studying, but I also thought at the time that I definitely wanted to study and would do so until I got my doctorate.
But right now I'm having doubts, especially about my career prospects.
On the one hand (Studycheck etc) you hear and hear about great career opportunities and that the profession is totally sought after, on the other hand you hear and hear about unemployed biologists and incredibly poorly paid jobs.
That's why I 'd be really interested.
1) What are you currently working on?
2) Are you satisfied with your job/salary?
3) What did you study?
4) Would you do the whole thing again?
Thank you very much for your answers.
I'm really uncertain right now and I'm thinking about maybe dropping out of college in 2022 and training to be a computer scientist.
If you have any experience, please write to me.
Extra stress before holidays and holiday weekends
This topic came up with me last week.
But now I had to use my long weekend to unwind from it.
That's why I'm putting a post on it now.
Not only before major holidays, such as Christmas holidays, there is great stress in our company.
Apparently, there's those before holidays plus bridge days.
Last week was the Ascension of Mary, which we in Switzerland call the "Ascension".
On Fridays, the vast majority of people and businesses have a bridge day, which is therefore semi-official.
So it was a long four-day weekend last week.
So what happened last week?
Stress everywhere.
Lots of e-mails that had to be sent out before the driveway, order here, order there, all *necessary* before the long weekend.
Because... why?
Because "next week then" sounds like so much time, and it can't be?
Or is it because people really want to accomplish as much in a shortened week as in a normal one?
Not only was I stressed on Wednesday, but I was also very nervous.
What's all this self-pity about the holidays?
Why do we have holidays if we are not allowed to enjoy them properly?!
The stress did not come from the top, the colleagues were all completely independent of it.
My question is simple: are we, the Swiss, the only ones like that?
Is that our Reformed Evangelical way?
Or do you know that in the north?
Yvonne Catterfeld looks forward to Christmas in Thuringia
Yvonne Catterfeld, 42, is looking forward to Christmas in her home state of Thuringia, but has not yet received any gifts.
"The beautiful thing is that even if there is no snow in Erfurt, you just drive to Ilmenau in the Thuringian forest", the actress and singer told Hit Radio FFH.
She'll tune in to the festivities by baking and baking cookies with her son.
"I love that", said Catterfeld.
Until the days of contemplation, however, she still has some things to do: "For the first time I have no gifts yet, I must finally get started now".

Since feathers are made up of a protein-containing substance, a particularly rich and balanced protein diet of the bird is essential for the formation of a flawless plumage.
For metabolism to function properly, the daily diet must contain adequate amounts of vitamins, minerals, and trace elements.
Most of the animal losses that occur during the mouse stage are due to insufficient or unbalanced protein intake and/or inadequate supply of vitamins and minerals.
The composition of NEKTON-Bio explicitly takes into account and compensates for the unfavourable ratio of amino acids in most plant-based feedingstuffs.

GDR handmade model old E-Lok E 95 03 DRG/ DR, the locomotive was in use in Silesia and Central Germany, the very rare locomotive probably comes from the conversion proposal of the model railway ME issue 11/1968, used with game tracks and missing parts see photos, function well, The E 95 series is a heavy freight train electric locomotive of the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft (DRG), which has been designed for the traction of heavy coal trains in the Silesian network, possibly the construction kit also comes from the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN.
A locomotive is in the DB Museum Halle (Saale) and we have restored it to working order.
In 1924, the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft had commissioned AEG to submit proposals for an electric locomotive capable of carrying 2,200-ton coal trains and 530-ton passenger trains at a cruising speed of 45 km/h on this line.
A maximum speed of 65 km/h was required.
Thus, in March 1926, the DRG decided on the delivery of the mechanical part as a 1Co+Co1 locomotive with Tatzlager drive, AEG with the delivery of the mechanical part, Siemens-Schuckertwerke with the electrical part.
From December 1927 to June 1928, six locomotives were delivered, which received the company numbers E 95 0106.
All of them survived the Second World War and found themselves on the territory of the future GDR.
In 1946, the locomotives arrived in the Soviet Union as repair goods.
They returned to Germany by November 1952.
In the Reichsbahn improvement plant Dessau, the serviceability of all six locomotives was determined.
In 1959 the three locomotives E 95 01 to E 95 03 were overhauled, with the remaining machines serving as spare parts donors.
At first, the E 04, E 44 and E 94, which were available in larger numbers, were preferentially assembled.
It was only when it was foreseeable that the number of upgrades could not be increased further with the E 94 that the E 95 came into the spotlight of upgrading.
[4] Initially, the locomotives were stationed at the Leipzig-Wahren railway works.
They came to the Halle P railway works in 1960.
They were used in a separate circuit mostly before coal trains from the Geiseltal in the direction of Halle, Leipzig and Erfurt.
As the locomotives grew older, complicated steering became a problem.
That's how it often happened that shooters stayed glued during skirmishes.
Then, with a hammer and chisel, the driver, who was constantly traveling on this locomotive, had to unlock the gun while it was in motion.
Damage to the traction engines occurred frequently and led to months of locomotive failure.
Since enough new locomotives were available at the end of the 1960s and a significant expansion of electric operation was not planned at the time, the Reichsbahn was able to do without old locomotives and most split types, so that the E 95 was taken out of service.
In addition, they argued that Deutsche Reichsbahn wanted to occupy electric locomotives only by one man, which would have resulted in a problem in train operation due to the difficulties mentioned with the machines and the visibility from the driver's cab.
After the E 95 02 and E 95 03 were discontinued in mid-1969, they were followed by the E 95 01, which left service on 5 October 1970.
The proposed new designation 255 001 was therefore never used.
All the locomotives except the E 95 02 have been dismantled.
The E 95 02 was built to replace the future museum locomotive E 77 10 as a cogeneration plant at Halle Hauptbahnhof.
It still took some time before those responsible at the Reichsbahn could be convinced that the E 95 was worth preserving as a museum locomotive.
In 1979, the first external work on the locomotive began with the aim of being able to present it to a vehicle show at RAW Dessau.
[5] It has since belonged to the Verkehrsmuseum Dresden as a non-operational museum locomotive.
In 1986, the internal completion of the locomotive took place.
In the DB Museum Halle (Saale), the locomotive is maintained as a museum.
Since 1995, employees of the traditional community Bw Halle P have been working on the operational upgrading of the locomotive.
In April 2015, the locomotive could be presented for the first time for an exhibition in the Museums-Bw Arnstadt with new interior and exterior painting, whereby the transformers were checked and five drive motors are operational.
-The locomotives were used until 1945 on the Silesian Mountain Railway and the branch lines, where they proved their reliability and low maintenance.
In February 1945, the machines were transferred to Leipzig to the central German network.
The main area of operation was initially Silesia.
Handmade model H0 in OVP, good function, optical reworking of the locomotive is necessary, dusted, with game tracks, cellar smell!!!, very rare handmade model, very small edition - the kit may also come from the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN
The packages may bear labels and traces of storage.
Yes, it's the F-parts.
I received a bed from you.
However, there were problems with one part.
The central beam is held by two feet...unfortunately these are too narrow and the beam cannot be mounted on the feet.
So, what do we do now?
I can't make the bed.
The central beam is held by two feet, which, unfortunately, are faulty manufactured.
The centre beam does not fit into the intended bracket.
So I get new ones sent to me.
When will they be dispatched?
No, they're not flat.
These are, according to the assembly instructions the right of the form, they were just too narrow
But it doesn't matter.
The important thing is that they serve their purpose.
They're not flat with me.
Could I have this mailed to me?
Hello #NAME#, do you want me to explain the problem to you again?
Residential fire with two minor injuries and high damage
Two people were slightly injured in a fire in an apartment building in Upper Bavaria.
In addition, there was an estimated damage in the six-figure euro area, police said on Sunday.
The fire had apparently spread from a carport to the adjacent residential building in Kinsau (Landsberg am Lech district).
Two residents were reportedly taken to hospital on Sunday with mild smoke inhalation.
The exact cause of the fire was initially unknown, but the police did not assume that it had been started deliberately.
The Fürstenfeldbruck police have taken over the investigation.
It's gonna be a long time before she gets here.
And I'll have to pay for shipping again.
Biotech CEO releases vaccine photo to debunk fake news
Uğur Şahin posted a photo of his first vaccination at the beginning of 2021 on the social network "LinkedIn"
Biontech chief Uğur Şahin had not yet publicly commented on his vaccination status.
Now the entrepreneur posted a photo showing his coronavirus vaccination.
A friend's illness prompted him to do so, Şahin said.
The CEO and co-founder of the Mainz-based company Biontech, Uğur Şahin, has published a photo showing him receiving a vaccine against the coronavirus.
There was misinformation on social media that I was supposedly unvaccinated.
In fact, my wife and I received 3 doses of the Biontech-Pfizer vaccine", Şahin wrote in a post on LinkedIn on Friday.
"For the past few months, friends have been urging me to post a picture of myself getting vaccinated to counter these false rumors".
So far, he's refused because he doesn't want communication to be about him.
But a phone call last week changed his mind: "I was deeply saddened to learn that an old school friend of mine is currently fighting for his life.
He is battling a severe COVID-19 illness and has been on a ventilator for three weeks.
The school friend and his family were not vaccinated, Şahin wrote.
He didn't ask why.
"However, the most common cause seems to be fear, often fuelled by misinformation and mistrust".
Fear is difficult to combat with facts, sometimes it is better to share personal experiences.
An interview with Deutsche Welle is circulating on the Internet, in which Uğur Şahin says he is not vaccinated.
However, the video was created in December 2020, as Deutsche Welle itself clarified.
"I'm not legally allowed to get the vaccine myself at the moment", Şahin said at the time.
There is a prioritization of vaccination in Germany.
Meanwhile, the prioritization has long been lifted - and the biotech boss has claimed to have been vaccinated three times.
Power plant fire leaves tens of thousands without electricity
In several municipalities in North Rhine-Westphalia, the lights went out on Friday evening: no electricity and, in many cases, no heating.
A fire had paralyzed a substation.
After a fire at a substation caused severe damage, tens of thousands of people in the Rhine-Sieg district of North Rhine-Westphalia were without electricity for about 24 hours.
As a result of the fire, the lights went out on Friday evening for 41,000 affected residents in several municipalities.
The utility Westnetz reported that on Saturday numerous emergency generators had been in operation until the large-scale disturbance could finally be completely fixed late in the evening.
Firefighters and THW volunteers provided support in the municipalities.
Authorities provided school-based care and called for neighborhood help.
The provider thanked the victims for their patience and the helpers for their dedication.
We are well aware that the last 24 hours have brought considerable constraints.
We also thank the affected municipalities, the county, the fire brigades and THW for their tireless efforts", said Florian Witt, Head of Primary Engineering, in a statement on Saturday evening.
The repair of the damage will take a few more days, he said, as the western grid installers were only able to bring some lines back into service temporarily.
A technical defect caused the fire, according to the company.
Power flowing again
According to Westnetz, the fire, which broke out on Friday at about 19.15, severely damaged parts of the 10,000-volt substation at the Neunkirchen-Seelscheid substation.
Extensive cleaning and repair work is required.
At the same time, a connection to a 30,000-volt voltage level was created.
With the help of this bypass, the power's back on line.
As of 6 p.m. on Saturday, over 21,000 people in Much and Ruppichteroth have had their electricity restored.
A further 20,000 inhabitants of Neunkirchen-Seelscheid had been gradually connected from 9.30 p.m.
As of 11:15 p.m., the last of those affected by the blackout still have power.
More than 80 installers from Westnetz and partner companies were involved.
Authorities had also called for neighborhood help after setting up an emergency power supply for important buildings on Saturday afternoon.
"It is important now that citizens take care of elderly or lonely people in their neighbourhood and notify the local fire stations if help is needed", said Sebastian Schuster (CDU) after a crisis meeting.
When emergency generators were installed and operated, the main focus was on the residents of old people's homes.
In addition, according to the authorities, temporary care spaces have been set up in schools for people who are unable to care for themselves or who need electricity-dependent medical devices or who are dependent on medical care.
How are you?
Unfortunately, the blanket is sold out in Germany.
Can I buy them from you and pay in euros?
It is the #PRS_ORG# day blanket in blue-green.
I hope you have a nice day too and please stay healthy ♡
I can't possibly mount this on the table top.
It is a custom #NAME#.
There are three explanations for this.
We wanted those with tabletops diameters of #NUMBER#
We have a diameter of 155 centimeters.
Today my #PRS_ORG# arrived, however I can't slide these together and shorten them.
Can you help me with that?
Otherwise I would have to send it back, since otherwise it is not fit for purpose.
I 'd love to hear back from you.
Yes, that's really easier!
Let's do it this way.
Can you e-mail me the return receipt?
The repair is now complete.
I had already tried this before the chat.
But before I bought it, I hadn't restarted the e-#PRS_ORG#.
Do you want me to do it now?
I find such a low credit almost impudent.
We don't agree with that.
Nordic combined: combiner Riiber wins
The German Nordic combiners Fabian Rießle and Julian Schmid have sprinted to the podium at the World Cup in Otepää, Estonia.

When will the money be transferred back to my account?
Yeah, we both rebuilt it, and we're using version 4.5...
It could be that you've heard of problems before.
Bought a book directly with my #PRS_ORG#, it seems to be on it too.
As soon as I want to open it, the message comes, ups!
This document could not be opened.
File may be faulty, please contact customer service.
As far as I can tell it's a #PRS_ORG# epub file.
Can you help me?
Chat connection's gone, and now what?
I have to work sometimes too!
To make the paint job even and clean, you should clean the components from dust, grease, and fingerprints with some soapy water, rinse with clear water, and dry.
Before you apply the brush to the model for the first time with a new paint, it is advisable to practice 2 to 3 strokes.
You can do this on the later invisible inside of the components or on a yogurt cup.
The first line on the component
Draw the brush evenly, line by line.
Slight overlapping of the layers of paint later ensures an even surface.
Avoid quick brushing back and forth.
This creates surfaces that seem unrealistic.
A model is not a fence.
Start with the bright colors.
The dark ones might shine through later.
Metallic tones and metallic colors come at the very end with a separate brush.
Otherwise, unsightly metallic glands may result when they mix with normal colors.
Allow the painted parts to dry for a day before installing them.
The models achieve an original appearance through the decals or decals.
From airplane insignia to ship names to license plates and license plates on car models, the decals give the model its finishing touches.
Place the decals in the correct order while the components are still within easy reach.
An aircraft cockpit can be plastered before it is mounted in the fuselage.
Even more important than the right tools, such as scissors, tweezers, and toothpicks, are time, patience, and a steady hand in gluing.
Cut out each decal you need and straighten it out.
Decals are also called water slides because you briefly soak the back of the decal in water until the backing paper darkens due to the moisture.
Then you just slide the image off a small piece of paper and place the piece on the corresponding spot on the model (which you also moistened before).
While holding the decal on the model with a tool, pull the backing paper away from the side.
Caution: Always check that the image is correctly positioned before sliding it completely off the paper so that it does not stick to the finger, wrinkle or even tear.
Drain excess water with a household towel.
Caution not suitable for children under 3 years of age
I can only open a book briefly, as soon as I'm looking for something else then I don't read the book anymore and I have to log out and log in and reload the book and find the job until I've finished reading.
I have already communicated with you on Saturday.
Can I get this by e-mail?
Even for all three packages?
Because the lamp came to me in three separate packages.
Okay, thank you very much.
Then I'll buy elsewhere as soon as the money comes back.
But can I get it back without a problem?
What is an 'insurance case'?
Hello, everybody, what's going on?
We've been in child-rearing treatment for some time, and now when it comes to settling the score with the car, it's suddenly crossed.
In order:
We had applied for the children's wish list in advance at PKV and got the promise of three tries.
The experiments were not restricted in any way (e.g. time frame, success, etc.).
The first attempt led directly to a successful pregnancy and birth and was settled with the PKV.
Some time later, we tried to have a second child, and we made two (unsuccessful) attempts, not counting the car.
We again applied to the PKV to cover the cost and were granted three more tries.
After a few more attempts (we have carried out more tests than promised, logically the most expensive ones pay off with the car) we submitted the invoices to the car and got the nasty surprise: instead of 5 attempts (2+3), the car only wants to repay 3 attempts.
Explanation: With the pregnancy/birth, the remaining 2 attempts of the first commitment are cancelled.
The second child wish is a new insurance case.
According to the AGB, however, "the insurance case begins with curative treatment, it ends when there is no longer any need for treatment".
The questions for the experts in this room are:
* Who is right here, the cars (only 3 trials are reimbursed) or us (there are 5 trials to be reimbursed)?
* Should the PKV have told us in the promises that with a birth the further attempts would be canceled?
* Is the desire for a second child really a new insurance case?
Infertility (caused by closed fallopian tubes) is not cured by the first child.
It would be great if the experts here would give their opinion.
Thank you so much for your help!
Can you e-mail me the three options and tell me the best way to contact them again?
It's all right. It's all right.
We're not ordering anything from them anymore.
If they add up the sales of me and my friend #NAME# (same address), they've obviously lost a good customer.
Feel free to pass that along to your manager.
That's not competitive.
Yesterday the colleague told me that the repayment was arranged and now you tell me that I have to send the thing back first.
I can 't help it if the dresser comes to me in a state of complete confusion.
Please see in the screenshot what the colleague wrote
It clearly states that the refund has been initiated and I still haven't received a refund via #PRS_ORG#
You can tell your manager that you've now lost two regulars.
My friend also used his account to order various pieces of furniture for our apartment.
We're not going to do that anymore.
No, the defect didn't occur until a few months later.
An office chair must withstand normal use.
Otherwise, they can't sell it as an office chair.
Regardless, the guarantee is valid for 24 months.
No, it is not possible for me to obtain another type of packaging.
I'll be able to dismantle the cabinet and put it at the disposal of the transport company.
Hello, I have a question about your #PRS_ORG# series
These products are advertised with additional stools to be purchased, but unfortunately we cannot find them with you.
Can they help?
This week's topic: The best low-budget films
What exactly a low-budget film is, there is no general definition with exact budget limits.
Here's what Wikipedia has to say about it:
A low-budget film or low-budget movie is a motion picture shot with little to no funding from a major film studio or private investor.
Lists of low-budget films are plentiful online, such as Letterboxd.com.
Do you know any interesting people in this category?
What is it that excites you?
And what might you not like at all?
I'm a very good customer of yours, I've already furnished two apartments completely with your furniture.
Wanted to get the best price on Odelle's gray leather sofa.
The delivery time has been extended once again, is it reliable now?
Thank you very much.
With warm greetings
There's no phone number, a chat where you have to wait 30 minutes is not a chat!
Unfortunately, there's no change in the waiting position... I'll give up again soon because it just doesn't work here.
How are you?
'Half-hearted victory' against Belarus comes at a high cost to the EU
The EU can declare a "half-victory" in the conflict with the Belarusian regime, according to political expert Raphael Bossong.
But the cost was very high and meant massive violations of the rights of migrants and refugees on Belarus' border with Poland and Lithuania, Bossong told the Evangelical Press Service (epd).
The EU has not solved the confrontation in a sustainable way, said the researcher from the Berlin Foundation for Science and Politics (SWP).
This state of suspended animation - Belarus is not giving up completely, but the EU feels like a winner - is likely to continue for some time.
The treatment of people at the border was not in line with the European Convention on Human Rights, Bossong said.
There appears to be an "increasing normalisation of pushbacks" by individual EU governments.
This is at the expense of fundamental rights, since the EU as a whole is not resolutely opposed to it.
At the same time, these developments weaken the cohesion of the Union.
"It can't seem to work if a member state decides to do its own thing", like Poland now, which doesn't even allow the EU border agency Frontex access to the border.
In addition, the EU paid a further price for its border policy with Belarus, Bossong said, adding that an agreement on asylum policy would be made more difficult by strengthening the "border guard, border guard, border guard" line.
Another attempt to cross the border
Meanwhile, according to Polish border guards, migrants have again tried to enter Polish territory via Belarus.
Fifty-five migrants were detained overnight on Sunday and returned to the border, a spokeswoman for the authority said on Sunday.
The Polish officials were stoned by the migrants not far from the town of Czeremsza during the incident.
According to reports, one soldier was hit in the face and had to be treated by a military doctor.
In total, the Border Guard recorded 52 attempted border crossings within 24 hours.
Already on Friday evening, a group of 28 migrants had broken through the border barriers.
Thousands of people from countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan have crossed or attempted to cross the EU-Belarus border in recent months.
The EU accuses Alexander Lukashenko as the ruler in Minsk of luring them with the prospect of entering the EU.
According to press reports, Poland and Lithuania sealed off sections of their borders.
The EU sanctioned Belarus and threatened airlines flying migrants and refugees into the country.
In addition, EU Commissioners travelled to people's countries of origin to prevent them from leaving.
The most effective element of the EU's response was to put pressure on the airlines, Bossong said.
"The EU has put its market power to the test and demonstrated its determination to operate with tough restraints and extraterritorial sanctions".
He also said that Minsk had to take account of domestic costs.
According to him, Belarusian society is not prepared for the fact that the security apparatus regularly smuggles thousands of people across the country.
Mercedes protests after controversial Formula 1 final
Max Verstappen is believed by Mercedes to have committed two rule violations during the race.
Abu Dhabi - Following the controversial Formula One final in Abu Dhabi, Mercedes has filed an appeal.
The Silver Arrows are suspecting two rule violations in the final Grand Prix of the year.
A protest relates to an alleged infringement by Max Verstappen at Red Bull in the final safety car phase, when he allegedly overtook unlawfully.
A second objection was lodged against the score at the end of the race.
In Mercedes's view, the protocol was not followed properly.
Verstappen had overtaken Lewis Hamilton in the Mercedes on the final lap and was racing for his first Formula One title.
The manoeuvre took place shortly after the end of a safety car phase in which the Dutchman had overtaken cars in front of him.
I'll look into it.
I'll talk to the bank and get back to you.
Thank you for your support.
Free entry for members: Europa-Park is organising the SC-Freiburg Fantag
The Europa-Park, which gives its name to the Europa-Park stadium of the sports club Freiburg, has invited SC Freiburg Fantag.
According to the park, members and permanent cardholders of the sports club from Breisgau as well as members of the fan community were allowed to visit Europa-Park free of charge on that day.
In addition, there were vouchers for drinks and sausage.
The roller coaster trains were glowing red and white through the jerseys that day.
Foxes, Ed Euromaus, and many red-and-white balloons provided the perfect backdrop", says the park.
Already since the beginning of the 1990s, there has been cooperation between the Bundesligist and the leisure park located in Rust, 40 kilometers north of Freiburg.
The first SC Freiburg Fantag in the Europa-Park has once again shown how well the partnership fits.
Seeing radiant fans having fun together on the roller coaster is proof of that", says Europa-Park owner Jürgen Mack.
Why is it $#NUMBER# and not like the original $1699?
Stages in the career of the new world champion Verstappen

Judith Hermann read from her novel "Home"
As part of the "LiteraTour Nord" reading series, author Judith Hermann read from her current novel "Daheim" in the sold-out Blue Note on Friday and also acted as a presenter.
She's divorced, lives in a house on the coast, and listens intently to the noises at her front door at night.
I submitted the contact form to return an item yesterday, but I haven't received an email confirmation or anything like that.
My question is whether my request has been received.
Not everyone has time for your bullshit chatter and mis-delivered cheap goods from China.
Your mistake, which you will correct and not all of our household.
Get in touch with Mrs. #NAME#.
I can't chat with them every day.
We had chatted yesterday and agreed that I or Mrs. #NAME# will receive an email with a 60 euro coupon, a new order of the #PRS_ORG# nightstand and a return label.
That e-mail hasn't come in yet.
He wants to take the package to #PRS_ORG# today.
Please contact me
With warm greetings

Sorry, but just because he says he's not anti-Semitic doesn't mean anything.
It's like an old man saying he doesn't have anything against foreigners.
Neither of you will admit it.
But Kollegah is constantly reproducing some kind of anti-Semitic message.
If you want to distance yourself, then you should just let it go completely.
Yeah wow then you're similarly not to take seriously as colleague.
Anyone who seriously questions the fundamental nature of evolution is simply out of his mind.
Because of me, a god set this whole thing in motion.
But once you're a creationist, you have to believe that the Earth is 10,000 years old and science is full of nonsense.
And that makes you an enemy of science and no longer to be taken seriously as colleague
To obtain an optimum field of vision, the magnifying glass should be placed as close as possible to the eye.
The specially designed aplanatic-achromatic lens system allows you to use the magnifying glass practically record- and color-error-free all the way to the edge zone.
Often magnifying glasses are marked with magnification information.
However, these indications apply only to precisely defined conditions, which rarely correspond to the conditions of use.
To get the most out of your magnifying glass, please refer to the instructions in the "Technical Data" table (see package leaflet).
Light reflections are produced on the lens surfaces of all optical devices, including impact lenses.
An anti-reflective coating significantly reduces these reflections.
If the optimum conditions of use are observed - lens close to the eye - reflections on the lens surfaces are less noticeable.

Tannen sale in Schönwolde: In the municipality of Krembz, women are looking for Christmas trees
Farmer Frank Diers has encountered a number of curious situations when selling reeds.
In one case, a man reportedly drove home without his partner because the two could not come to an agreement.
Every year, he plants about 2,000 of them.
The 56-year-old has experienced many curious situations.
That's what always makes the pre-Christmas season a little fun, he says.
What about the coupon?
Otherwise I'm out as a customer?!
After all, I received a defective shipment and now I've paid full price for it.
Then I will evaluate it accordingly!
We do not need to argue about which is the better dish, but there is a certain resemblance between the two.
Both consist of meat that is grilled on a spinning spit.
And that's how they both got their names.
In German, the equivalent might be something like the "Dreher", which doesn't sound nearly as delicious.
Problems with optical fiber + Devolo DLan/Magic
We've had a new fiber-optic connection in the house for a few weeks.
Unfortunately, I'm having trouble setting up a stable Wi-Fi network right now.
I used to have a 50 Mbit DSL connection, and I used Devolo DLan, which, except for a few glitches, received and sent 50 Mbit without any problems.
The new fibre optic connector sends 500 Mbit to the FritzBox 7590 and the DLan module connected to the FritzBox receives them.
However, the other DLan module, which sends the Wi-Fi, no longer receives the full 500, but the further I go in the house with the module, the less it receives (so I use a socket that is 1, 2, 3, etc. rooms away from the other module).
As a result, the Internet with the new fiber optic connection on the first floor is now even slower than before (~45 Mbit).
I also ordered a new Devolo Magic set, which apparently uses some new technology.
This was slightly better than the DLan, but there were similar losses.
Can someone please explain to me why fiber optic is "losing" so much internet speed over the power line?
And is LAN really the only solution?
It would be extremely time-consuming to install any more LAN cables in the house.
I'm really desperate, which is why I set up an account here.
That is why I should like an answer all the more.
When it's time to change the current account
Anyone who thought that the current accounts would be quiet for a while now is mistaken.
While many banks have taken advantage of the autumn to use all sorts of tricks to get their customers to reaffirm past increases in fees, negative interest rates are also falling further.
Deutsche Bank, for example, was considered relatively generous for a long time with a limit of €100,000.
Now she's cut the allowance in half and even quadrupled it for a day's pay.
In a first step, the limit was reduced only for customers of the Group's Postbank division - to EUR 50 000 for current and savings accounts and to EUR 25 000 for day-to-day accounts.
In the meantime, however, these lower exemptions apply to Deutsche Bank as a whole, as a spokesman confirmed on request.
This applies not only to new contracts but also to 'new individual agreements with existing customers'.
Commerzbank had previously gone down to a limit of EUR 50 000, which still applies, as did ING Deutschland.
Direct Bank DKB, which is particularly popular with cost-conscious customers, has reduced the free amounts in two stages, initially to EUR 50 000, and now to EUR 25 000.
After all, according to figures from the Internet portal Verivox, more than 100 banks now have a credit limit of 25,000 euros or less.
Sparda-Bank Berlin has also reached a figure of EUR 25 000: however, there is still a legal dispute with the consumer centres, which have even won in the first instance before the Landgericht Berlin against this regulation.
There are already discussions in the banks about whether institutions should set up reserves in the event that the higher authorities also declare negative interest rates inadmissible in principle and many millions have to be repaid to bank customers.

Jennifer Aniston employs a whole army of beauties
She's now officially at the top of Hollywood.
Yet, their lives are like a roller coaster ride.
Jennifer Aniston, 52, was named the most influential woman of the year by the U.S. magazine The Hollywood Reporter.
For her, who created a sensation in 2021 with the reunion of "Friends" and the continuation of her series "The Morning Show", this success is primarily the result of a lot of discipline and work.
Their appearance is taken care of by an army of assistants, stylists, and trainers.
After all, says Aniston, she treats herself to one chip a day (yes, that's right: a SINGLE chip from the bag).
It's a miracle that the hearts of both male and female fans are drawn to her.
Maybe because she's just down on her luck and still looking for love.
And crossed out wanting to have a baby.
Before that, she was constantly asked when she was going to become a mother.
It hurt her.
The people who asked that have no idea what's wrong with me personally, medically, why I can't.
It was really hurtful.
Keep hoping that success and fame will also make you happy.
An undignified end to a career: Räikkönen has to give up
Kimi Räikkönen's departure from Formula 1 was even quieter than expected.
Abu Dhabi - The 42-year-old Finn took off his gloves and wiped the sweat from his forehead.
That's it.
After a driving error and a slight tyre contact, Räikkönen had to stop his Alfa Romeo at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix after less than half the race distance.
It was his 349th and final Grand Prix, the "Iceman" ending his career in the premier class of motorsport.
His wife Minttu and their two children had also travelled to the United Arab Emirates to say goodbye.
Räikkönen's greatest success was winning the 2007 World Championship in the Ferrari.
He won 21 Grands Prix, started from pole 18 times and finished on the podium 103 times.
Friedrich wins the 60th World Cup - Nolte wins in the two-man bobsled - Sport
The mark of the Norwegian biathlete Ole Einar Björndalen with 94 successes is the goal of the bobsledder.
"I calculated that I would have to score nine and a half victories per season, then I could make it to Cortina 2026", said the double Olympic champion from BSC Oberbärenburg, who recorded two victories in two days at the Winterberg races.
It was not until Saturday that he defended the attack of Johannes Lochner by five hundredths, in which he drove from third to first place.
Then he changed the material settings slightly, and on Sunday he drove out with a 0.30-second head start.
With his team Thorsten Margis (SV Halle), Candy Bauer (BSC Oberbärenburg) and Alexander Schüller (SV Halle) he prevailed against the British Brad Hall.
Third place went to the Austrian Benjamin Maier.
"We took a bigger risk today and were rewarded", said Friedrich, who also claimed his 22nd straight victory.
Berchtesgaden's Johannes Lochner, riding for Stuttgart, came in fifth place after previously being second.
Christoph Hafer from BC Bad Feilnbach finished in eighth place after placing fourth in the first race.
"If I knew what he did differently, I'd do it the same way", Lochner said.
Nolte with home victory - podium for Jamanka
On the women's side, Laura Nolte took home her third victory of the season in the two-man bobsled.
After it was only enough for the fourth place in the monobobob the day before, she raced on Sunday in the German triple success with forward Deborah Levi to the World Cup victory.
Two-bob Olympic champion Mariama Jamanka from BRC Thuringia came in second with Germany's fastest sprinter, Alexandra Burghardt from Burghausen.
In addition to her Olympic qualification, she took first place on the podium this winter.
The Wiesbader Kim Kalicki ended up with Leonie Fiebig in third place.
For me it was super cool, first podium in the World Cup, I'm super happy that Mariama is taking me.
I'm super happy with the development.
There is still a lot of potential at the start, but the start times today were okay", said Burghardt, emphasising: "It's not just pushing, but there's also an enormous amount of work to be done".
Jamanka was a little annoyed by the not-so-flawless driving, but said: "It's going in the right direction".
I already had the blanket in the shopping cart and could buy it now!!!
What do you want me to do?
I just didn't get it, so I couldn't cash it, so I finally asked around.
Because of Corona, I had completely different problems last year and never had time for it.
And now they're saying it's expired, which pisses me off.
Look in the chat it was about the Asare bench.
I'd like to return it and then order again since it's on sale right now.
How come the shipment doesn't start until the 16th of March?
There was nothing about such a long delivery time on your website.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. No, no, no, no, no. No, no, no, no. No, no, no, no, no. No, no, no.
It was picked up by your colleague yesterday.
Why This Is a Problem Today
I also sent you pictures of the wrong-delivered merchandise.
But we still want the shelf module, just a new undamaged
And not cancel the whole order.
Just this day, just this week, just until XY...
Hello dear awesome girls and girls and women,
I've got some stuff I just want to write and maybe he'll get it or others will get it too...
I'm 24 years old, I have kPTBS, I'm a full-time student, and I'm a dog mom -- apart from the fact that my dog doesn't cry or go to kindergarten, he's actually one of my children.
My boyfriend (we've been together for 6 years) is sick, got a second-degree burn on Monday and has been depressed for years (but is now in therapy).
Yesterday I went to see him because I have emotional needs too and because I want to see him and feel him, we hugged a lot and it was nice.
I was helping him take a shower (because his hand is bandaged from burns).
On top of that, he has a cold and we don't see each other as often as we used to, which makes me struggle with my need for affection and love.
My puppy just had a stomachache, I cooked for him and now he's lying in his cuddly blanket and has relaxed a bit after I was there with the heat lamp and caressing for him.
I live alone with my sister and my mother, and she just left for a month.
Now we have to do household chores, which, of course, we divide up.
But cooking is a lot of work for me right now...
My PTSD is in pretty good shape right now, and I'm in pretty good shape, and I'm doing okay.
Not well, but I'm doing fine, and I'm almost symptom-free.
My university is demanding a lot (for me), tomorrow at 3 pm I have a written test for which I have not done anything and the day after tomorrow anatomy class for which I should at least prepare a little.
And next week I have an oral exam on Tuesday, and what comes next is on my calendar and not in my head because there's no more room.
So this is how my week is going to go, just until the day after tomorrow, and then it's the weekend.
But after that, the whole thing goes on, doesn't it?
Just until your birthday.
Just until the holidays.
Just till the end of the week.
Just until...
And so it goes on forever and ever.
I think I'm just so stressed right now that I need these mental cues, because otherwise I'm gonna take this down.
Somehow I feel guilty and chaotic, but I can't do it any other way...
Is that how you feel?
Honestly, I'm just so grateful that I don't have to work.
I can't tell you how grateful I am.
I don't know if I would have survived my KPTS otherwise.
I think it has something to do with women's mental load, and that's why I thought I'd find fellow sufferers here...
In any case, I wish you a restful evening, the week is almost over!
I got my order today. Unfortunately, it's a whole different color, plus the surface is scratched and the table leg has a print.
The first shipment was the same color as the website.
We are very disappointed!!!!
What can you offer me?
If we're gonna switch tables now, do I get a different color or what?
The cancellation email was sent on December 26th.
For the rest, twice.
It hasn't been confirmed.
On a completely different note, when I was in school, I noticed that many of our religious teachers did not believe in God and viewed it as just another subject, like math or geography.
For me, it was always a little strange, maybe because I was raised as a Christian and I've always sort of believed that.
How do you feel about that?
Perhaps you can tell about workmates or schoolmates with different attitudes.
Basically, I understand the difference between personal and professional, and it makes sense to separate.
There is a curriculum and so on.
But it would just be weird to have a physics teacher who doesn't believe in relativity.
What makes you want to teach religion if you don't believe in it?
Preserving culture or something?
Hope your question isn't too personal.
Can't it be changed or not? Please write in English, I understand it well
It's been a long time.
I'm fine, thank you.
I expect to hear back from you in due course, no later than the beginning of next week.
Thank you for your support #NAME#.
Film search help please
Hello, people.
I'm looking for a film from my childhood.
I think it was a movie for teenagers.
In the film, there are two timelines (or parallel worlds).
On the one hand, the modern world.
On the other hand, the past (or the realm of the dead) is not entirely certain.
Since I can't describe it any more, in the real world, there's a young woman.
And in the realm of the dead, a young soldier (uniform similar to that of the soldiers from Curse of the Caribbean).
For some reason, the paths intersect and a plot emerges.
The antagonist is also a soldier from the realm of the dead who wants to bring the woman to this realm so that she can live herself, I mean.
The passage is also, I believe, the soldier's grave.
In the end, I believe both soldiers will fight each other.
If that means anything to you, I'm grateful for any answer.
Our baby's been sleeping on her stomach since week one.
Fast forward: is still alive:D
You need to relax.
A kid like that can take a lot more than you think.
Make sure everything's in order around it, no cuddly animals, go in and look more often, but no minutes of surveillance.
It's driving you crazy!
Fresh air in the room.
It's a good mattress.
There are no pillows.
Achso and ours didn't have a sleeping bag, but always had a blanket.
Watch your child when he sleeps.
Does it turn its head sideways?
Can it erect itself from the belly?
Or is it face-first into the mattress?
That'll tell you if everything's all right.
We all grew up, too, and when my husband was born, it was customary to put the kids on their stomachs to sleep.
Besides, we're already "regular" customers of yours, and we've already bought a lot of items.
Then why are you only offering me 20 euros?
Hi, I texted a colleague of yours yesterday and I haven't heard back.
It's about my wardrobe that arrived the day before yesterday (order number: #ALPHANUMERIC-ID#).
The right drawer doesn't fit in the closet.
Please contact me as soon as possible.
The closet is currently unusable.
Let me get this straight.
RBTV has promised a lot.
And yes, I know myself, not everything can be kept.
And I had a lot of fun with RBTV, too.
It's just that this station's politics have gone downhill.
Almost every format is sponsored (okay), but then at the same time go on a big begging tour.
It was said that you were an "independent" Internet broadcaster.
To quote Arno: "You don't want to be a walking pillar of the bed".
What are you now?
An 0815 commercial station trying to get his BilloMerch to the elite fan.
And then we have Marah's do's and don'ts.
Which, of course, apply to everyone except Simon and Etienne.
Of course, they're allowed to keep insulting people.
A Krogman totally lacking in empathy and trying to burn the rented rooms with the exploded at the expense of the action.
How do you like all this?
It's great if you like it. I hate it.
I'm requesting a recall because my wooden table was delivered defective.
Fracture due to defective delivery of the #PRS_ORG#.
Whether as a comforter for abdominal pain or just for cuddling  My little warm friend is versatile.
Cherry seed pillows are a traditional home remedy for beneficial thermal applications, as cherry seeds are very good at absorbing heat and releasing it in a measured way.
The removable inner cushion can easily be heated in the microwave or in the oven.
The soft cover makes the application especially pleasant, so that the little ones feel safe, even if they are not doing so well.
The cherry kernel cushion with cover shall only be suitable as a thermal insulation for the following applications:
Before heating the pillow, check for any unusual odour, stains from sticking or burning and, if present, dispose of immediately.

Heat in the microwave at a maximum of 300 watts for a maximum of 2 minutes (please refer to the specifications of the microwave manufacturer).
Immediately after heating, distribute the heat evenly in the pillow by shaking!
Then place the inner cushion in the frame.
A slight moisture build-up may occur on the surface during initial heating, but disappears with repeated application.
Be sure to follow the warming instructions, as prolonged periods or higher energy consumption may cause damage (danger of ignition and combustion!).
Before heating the cushion in the microwave, check that heating of grain products is permitted in the manufacturer's instructions for use.
After the heated inner pillow has been placed back in the frame, please check the temperature of the pillow for suitability for babies (max. 43 °C) at your elbow!

Darmstadt after the Hinserie Second - Pauli wins in Düsseldorf
Darmstadt 98 can dream of returning to the football Bundesliga.
Meanwhile, Hannover 96 is working its way out of the table basement.
For Ingolstadt, it's not going to work under the third coach either.
Jubilation in Darmstadt after the late victory in the top game, joy in Hannover over interim coach Christoph Dabrowski and frustration in Ingolstadt after the unsuccessful start under the new coach Rüdiger Rehm.
Is the battery dead?
Last night my laptop (ThinkPad E480 20KQ and about 3 years old) stopped charging through my power supply.
I bought this new about five months ago, so it should still work.
I thought the power supply alone would do the trick.
It's missing, the battery's dead, and the laptop won't start even though it's plugged in.
So I took out the battery, but it's not working here either.
Do you have any ideas?
A new battery has been ordered, but why can't I use the laptop on the network?
Is there something else that's broken?
Thank you for your help.
I want the delivery of the #PRS_ORG# to the room.
How can I book this?
I'm interested in the #PRS_ORG# chair.
I don't know how high the seat is...
A lot of touring and still carrying a lot of gear?
With the Everyday V2 backpack from Peak Design, no problem!
20 litres of capacity swallow even larger photographic equipment without problems, which can be safely stored using the padded FlexFold dividers.
And what else you need from everyday objects remains well organized and separable from the photographic equipment thanks to convenient accesses in the customizable interior.
With the "Update" of the Everyday Line to version 2 (V2), the series presents itself in a new look.
With the Everyday Backpack series, Peak Design has developed some highly innovative solutions that reliably protect the inside of the backpack while still allowing instant access to photographic equipment.
This works in two ways: one is conventional, via the lid flap, which can be closed with the MagLatch locking system, a brilliantly thought-out solution for effective protection, which has already proven itself in the Messenger bags.
There is a metal clasp hook with matching anchor bars on the front of the backpack in the clasp flap.
Unlike most backpacks, Peak Design has designed different "filling positions": there are 4 anchor beams, solidly anchored, into which the clasp hook can be hooked.
If the backpack is full, you just take the topmost beam, it's rather empty, a lower one.
The valve cap and hook are also magnetic.
In this way, the backpack can also be securely closed without locking the hook.
The second possibility also fundamentally distinguishes the Everyday backpack from other photo backpacks: in addition to the lid flap, there is a zipper opening on both sides of the backpack.
This eliminates the main disadvantage of conventional backpacks with access from above - you no longer have to dig through the contents!
At the same time, this clever detail greatly increases the usefulness of the backpack for everyday use: not only for your photographic equipment, but also for everyday items or travel luggage.
In the Everyday Backpack, you can configure the interior individually (more on this below) and thus easily store both separately from each other - and also access them independently through the two side openings.
In addition, you can pull the backpack forward from the right side of your body to access, for example, the camera equipment in the right main compartment, while the everyday items remain safely in the left half of the backpack and do not get in the way.
Comfortable, easily adjustable support belts help with this.
And because the backpack's outer shell is also made entirely of 100% recycled, weather-resistant nylon, the contents stay dry even when it's supposed to go to Scotland in the fall.
Unfortunately, I'm waiting in vain for your support email.
#NAME# sent me an email yesterday confirming the commissioning of the
Contact has been made by the dispatcher to pick up the wrongly delivered table.
So far I haven't received any message.
I request immediate action.
I'm already writing with the third support person, and I've never gotten any further than the promise that I'll get a confirmation email.
This is the return of the incorrectly delivered custom #NAME#
Is there any way to predict when the cabinet might be delivered again?
Keeping him like this is not an option for me...
It's working. It's working.
Thank you so much for your help.
I wish you a pleasant evening.
Hello, my order number is #NUMBER#. When will the item be delivered?
The order was placed and paid for on 12.1.21.
I got a completely different lamp than the one I ordered.
Please call me.
If you renew my coupon, I'll place a larger order, but at least I kept the damaged piece of furniture and didn't send it back.
And that the past year went differently than expected I could not guess and I just could not redeem it and clear it in time.
But the damage is on me as a customer, and I won't accept it.
Rotinger brake discs are designed for the demands of the dynamic driver, who appreciates reliability and safety when braking even under difficult conditions.
Rotinger brake discs are made of cast iron and then machined (drilled and cut).
All tinted panes are produced in short series according to individual technical characteristics specific to certain panes and patterns.
On the basis of the individual technical drawing, a special manufacturing programme is drawn up, which is based on the balancing of the panel according to the characteristics of the original assembly.
The tinted discs produced in this way ensure a high level of comfort and braking efficiency.
Additionally created openings increase the effectiveness of the cooling of the disc, with the slots improving the cleaning of the brake discs and brake pads.
The aesthetic qualities of our tinted windows emphasise the character of each car through an attractive and striking appearance.
Coloma is the city where an unexpected event shaped the history of the West Coast.
In the winter of 1848, a man on the south fork of the American River spotted glowing chunks in the water.
Although he tried to keep his discovery a secret, the news spread quickly, triggering the so-called 49 California Gold Rush.
Thousands came from near and far, making Coloma one of the fastest-growing and most prosperous cities in the country.
Areas were cleared, tents were set up, and saloons and hotels sprang up almost overnight.
Everyone wanted their share of the country's wealth.
For many, it was "Coloma or Bust!"
In this game, you're a pioneer looking to make his fortune in the West and make a name for himself.
You'll mine for gold, recruit workers, raise horses and build businesses.
You will also have the opportunity to explore the surrounding streams and adjacent areas.
You are not alone - the other pioneers seem to have the same idea!
You have to outdo your fellow pioneers so you don't go broke with the rest of them.
Coloma is a fast-paced strategy game with multiple paths to victory.
You simultaneously choose your actions, you have to manage your resources and build a tableau that works more and more for you (so-called "engine building").
The buildings on your tableau allow you to become more efficient, gain additional actions, or bend rules in your favor.
With these buildings and the dynamic bridge tiles, you can fine-tune and develop your own unique style of play.
Coloma takes place over a three-year period from 1848 (the year gold was discovered in Coloma), through 1849 (the year of the California Gold Rush) to 1850 (the year California gained official statehood).
A year in Coloma consists of five rounds.
During each round, players will secretly and simultaneously select a location on the game map where they can perform actions.
Then their choices are revealed and they place their pioneers in the appropriate locations.
If a site has the most pioneers, it gets a lockdown!
This disables the other half of the site, reducing the number of possible actions there.
Players then take turns performing actions such as extracting resources, moving carts, setting up tents, exploring rivers, building bridges, opening shops, and positioning gun heroes.
When all the actions are completed, the pioneers will return.
The announcer rotates to a new location at the start of each round, changing the available actions.
This continues until the announcer has moved five times, covering each location once, and the year is over.
There is a shootout in which players must defend Coloma from an onslaught of angry bandits.
If players have contributed enough gun heroes and outnumber the bandits, they will receive rewards.
However, if they fail, they receive lower rewards or end up in the graveyard.
The game ends after the third shootout, then the final score is made.
The player with the most victory points wins!
In the case of free delivery, up to the dimensions of 35 x 25 x 4.5 cm, I take the mode of dispatch, consignment of goods (games in foil).
For everything else, mostly DPD insured and with consignment tracking (games laminated, wrapped with flies and packing paper).
If you're a collector, for an extra 2 euros, I can also send carton in carton, which means 100% no printing.
"Why children are not tyrants" by Doku, ARD Media Library
EC internal market, free movement of goods, free movement of capital, free movement of capital, free movement of capital, free movement of capital, free movement of capital, free movement of capital, free movement of capital, free movement of capital, free movement of capital, free movement of capital, free movement of capital, free movement of capital
The ARD documentary popped up on my Twitter timeline today, and I looked at it right away.
>Pediatric psychiatrist Michael Winterhoff is a frequent guest on talk shows and lectures throughout Europe.
With his book "Why Our Children Become Tyrants" (2008), he sparked a fierce parenting debate.
Former patients and guardians are now making serious allegations against him.
Please take care of yourselves, the film is difficult to bear.
And I'm very grateful that a lot of people are thinking and acting differently now.
Our parents and other responsible persons must never, never, never be about power over the child.
Our goal must always be to give the child space for his development and to make the framework for the child as large as it is reasonable and possible in the situation.
Brrr, I'm still shaking like this.
Holetschek: Countries discussing the abolition of the test requirement for those who have been vaccinated three times
The health ministers of the Länder want to decide at their next meeting on a nationwide abolition of the test requirement for triple vaccinated people.
"We countries urgently need clarity on whether and when the test requirement can be waived for those who have been vaccinated three times", Klaus Holetschek (CSU), chairman of the Health Ministers' Conference, told Bild am Sonntag.
The elimination of 2G plus for those who have been vaccinated three times "is not only medically sensible, but also provides an additional incentive for vaccination", Holetschek said.
German Health Minister Karl Lauterbach (SPD) has promised "that he will make a proposal to the Health Ministers' Conference as early as next Tuesday".
So I want to send the lamp back
What's the best way to do that?
Hi, I like the #PRS_ORG# chair very much, but I can't see how high the seat is.
Can you help me?
I can't do any more shopping on my #PRS_ORG#.
Ups, there's been a mistake.
Shopping is done through the #PRS_ORG# page on the computer.
I updated the account information.
What could be the reason?
What you're describing is called awareness, which is sensory perception under general anesthesia.
These occur at a frequency of about 1 in 1000.
Hearing sounds/voices occurs most frequently, seeing images occurs less frequently, and perception of pain occurs very rarely.
Relevant to this topic: Caesarean sections are surgeries that are accompanied by an increased rate of awareness, since to protect the child, very deep anesthesia is avoided until the navel is removed.
Previous episodes of Awareness should be mentioned at the anaesthesia interview.
Certain anaesthetic procedures, such as total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA), are associated with a slightly increased risk.
EDIT: Dear everyone, this comment of mine correctly describes Awareness, but by definition, Nitemarex didn't have one.
I misread your comment.
But the chair is broken.
I'm afraid the 20 euros won't help either.
These are statutory warranty claims.
The absolute minimum would be for them to take back the defective chair.
In addition to the legal obligation, this is also standard in the field of e-commerce.
Please make sure you're at least returning the defective chair.
We'll sell the second chair privately.
We're losing a lot of money, too.
I already sent you an e-mail, which you didn't answer.
The question again.
It says in the order and on the invoice that the goods will be delivered to a room of my choosing.
The carrier is company #NAME#.
I just got off the phone with them.
I was told they only deliver to the front door because of #PRS_ORG#.
Is that so?
If so, I'll have to cancel the order because I don't know anyone who can carry my heavy furniture to the first floor.
I'm not getting any calls, am I?
I had formulated a question
Theatre historian Günther Rühle dies at the age of 97
He has made a name for himself as a theatre critic and as an intendant.
Later, he wrote a monumental history of the theater.
On Friday, Günther Rühle died at the age of 97.
There's the new book on the table, freshly printed, "An Old Man Getting Older".
The shocking diary of a slow farewell to the world, which the theater historian and journalist Günther Rühle led until April 2021.
And in the middle of the reading comes the news that the author has died.
The last sentence in the book is, "I'm here to give thanks for the rest of my life".
There are different types of pallets.
One of the most common are European pallets, standardized wooden pallets used primarily in the European area as load carriers.
They are certified by the European Pallet Association EPAL
In 2020, according to data from Statistics Austria, more than 10 million pallets were produced in Austria.
The production value was a good 79 million euros.
The number of pallets imported into Austria per year is not charged
New York wins its first MLS championship
New York City FC has won the title for the first time in Major League Soccer.
After going 1-1 in the regular season against the hosts Portland Timbers, the team from the Eastern Conference decided the final in penalty shootout with 4:2.
In the Eastern Conference finals, New York defeated Philadelphia Union, the team of German Kai Wagner.
Rouladen tips and tricks
I got a lot of great tips here last week for the perfect goulash.
We had that for Christmas and it was incredibly delicious and buttery!
So thanks again for that.
Now that I've gotten the hang of it, I'd like to make my first New Year's Eve rouladen.
Tomorrow, I'm going to start a cattle fund.
Do you have any other tips for me?
Note: I do not have an oven, but only a large pot.
What's next?
What about the books or how do I get them back on my #PRS_ORG#?
My English isn't as good as it used to be, but I'm getting there.
It's about a refund of €#NUMBER#
I was already informed by e-mail on 18 January that the refund had been made.
But to this day I have not received the money.
Would you check over there, please?
Where there are still Christmas roasts in the Lübeck area
For many people, the goose or the duck is as much a part of Christmas as the fir tree and the presents.
You haven't got any poultry yet?
We're running out of time.
We'll tell you where you can get a Christmas roast in Lübeck.
The "drive" of a tube end stage contributes significantly to the heat and fat content of the guitar amplifier sound.
These characteristics are perfectly represented by the Valve Reactor circuit.
With the VOLUME, GAIN and MASTER VOLUME controls, you can set the desired level and the refractive index of your sounds.
Furthermore, the VT+ series amplifiers offer a unique POWER LEVEL control which can be used to reduce the sound level without altering the gain and distortion.
We heard earlier that the POWER LEVEL control can even be used to create a power reserve in the event of excessive noise.
Thanks to the POWER LEVEL controller, the full potential of the VT+ series can be used in any situation.
The headphone jack can also be used as a line outlet.
The signal here is processed with a box simulation, so that you get an eminently "acoustic" sound impression even when using headphones or direct recordings.
A CD or MP3 player can be connected to the AUX so you can jam to your favorite songs.
A tuner function is also on board - so you don't need a separate voice device.
If you also buy a VFS5 foot button, you can also call up the sounds comfortably by walking, turning the effect blocks on/off and "tapping" the tempo of the compatible effects.
For the live operation, this is actually indispensable.
With its new power packages, VOX takes another step into the future!
But that's how I've seen it with other people.
Is there any way to send the lamp back to you?
Because it's too low for a dining room table?
So I'd like to send them back.
Can you help me with that?
What about the dresser?
Will we get an update on the exact delivery date in the next few weeks?
Hello, have you ever sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs
If you can't, I'd be happy with a discount or a coupon.
Maybe I can find a buyer for the furniture.
Just over 1,000 euros for goods I don't need is a bit much.
I've just received my delivery and would like to know if screws were included as part of the shipment.
I would like to mount the #PRS_ORG# mirror (door) on the designated hooks.
That's not a satisfactory answer, and it wasn't worth the wait.
Is there a premium customer status with you?
Iran sees progress in nuclear deal negotiations
According to Iran, progress is being made in the negotiations on the revival of the international nuclear agreement.
"Both sides are close to agreeing on the issues that should be on the agenda", Iran's chief negotiator Ali Bagheri told the IRNA news agency on Sunday.
He said this was a "positive and important development" because there was not even agreement at the outset on the issues to be negotiated.
The aim of the agreement is to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons.
On Thursday, the Vienna talks to revive the agreement resumed after an interruption of almost a week.
Negotiators from Iran, Germany, the United Kingdom, China, France and Russia are taking part in the negotiations.
A US delegation is also present in Vienna, but is only indirectly involved in the negotiations.
Thuringia overtakes Saxony - Free State now Federal state with highest corona incidence
Thuringia has replaced Saxony and currently has the highest incidence in Germany.
It is the only federal state to have a value above the 1000 mark.
Thuringia was the only federal state where the number of coronavirus cases exceeded 1,000 on Sunday.
The Robert Koch Institute reported a seven-day value of 1,025 new infections per 100,000 people.
In Saxony, which until recently had the highest incidence in Germany, the figure was 990.5 on Sunday.
On Friday and Saturday, the incidence in Thuringia had decreased slightly, but had also been above the value of 1000.
In Thuringia, 2242 new infections with the SARS-CoV-2 virus and 16 additional deaths related to infection were reported within one day.
200 severe COVID-19 patients received intensive care in hospitals on Sunday.
There may be delays in reporting on weekends.
In addition, health departments have been overwhelmed for weeks and are barely keeping up with new cases.
I can understand that.
Since the delivery doesn't take place until the beginning of March, it might be possible by then.
I have to print this out and stick it on the package and take it to the post office, is that it?
I don't have to click/specify/fill in anything else here?
That's exactly what I want to avoid, which is why I'm writing to you.
I'd like to take care of the return at my own expense.
8 euro return fee is in my eyes an impertinence.
It's time for a change.
###MBundestag I'm here in the plenary hall in the heart of Europe on a fantastic day!
What's the mail for?
If you look at the activity of the Bundestag in recent months, one thing is clear: it does not exist.
We went into winter rigidity and extended the summer hole for a few months.
What's the problem?
Yeah, what was it about?
For the most part, it may simply be related to dissatisfaction with the way some things have gone and with the way we are in general.
In the last few days, there has been a growing impression that many people here are still really interested in the Bundestag.
#What we need to change
At this point, the community around the Bundestag is asked who wants to keep it alive.
The impetus came from u/edizVEVO, which became aware of this project in the last few days and found a pile of debris, to put it simply.
After some back-and-forth, several people from the community found themselves eager to rebuild the project.
However, I would also like to expressly call on everyone once again to participate, as this is the only way this project can continue in the future.
To do this, we have created a discussion platform in the form of a Discord server where we can exchange ideas and work out concrete things.
You can access the server through this link.
The objectives are:
* How will the Bundestag work in the future?
* Which existing schemes need to be changed/adapted/removed?
* How should we behave on the outside in the future?
* How should new members be recruited?
* How do we create a fair electoral system?
I'm pretty sure I'm forgetting a few things, but that's okay, because we'll end up with Discord.
If you have the time and the inclination, come to Discord, work with us, and let us democratically decide the future.
I ordered a lampshade from you, which will be delivered.
Now I see that the article is too big/clumpy for it and not suitable for my taste.
I've already ordered another hanging from you.
I put it together and noticed this when I took the soft foam.
Very sad about that.
I hope this gets returned and I get a full refund.
This is also quite sad as the #NAME# is much darker than expected.
I have another question: the daily blanket #PRS_ORG#, is it also available in extra size, so in 240/240 for example?
#PRS_ORG# must be able to guarantee that the defective cabinet will be picked up in a timely manner.
And I'm asking you to make that happen now.
I don't have a suitable packaging, but I will disassemble the cabinet as much as possible for collection - they have to clarify with #PRS_ORG# how this can work.
#PRS_ORG# can contact me by phone at any time to arrange a pick-up date.
Is there a manual for assembly?
How long would it take me to get them or to decide whether to return them?
How do you answer the question, why are you vegan?
Today I had a conversation with a colleague I like.
She herself used to be a vegetarian for a while, but now she rarely eats meat.
I myself was a vegetarian for a few years before that.
When asked if I had always wanted to be a vegan, and vegetarianism was a planned intermediate step, I answered honestly without much thought.
And that is, for a long time, I thought that being a vegetarian would be supporting animal welfare, but at some point I reflected and realized that I was ultimately supporting animal cruelty.
Hence my decision to go vegan.
At that moment, I had the impression that there was resentment on her side, and then she defended vegetarianism, saying that she knew where her meat came from and that being a vegetarian would reduce animal suffering.
Now I wonder if my answer was to "plump"?
How do you answer the question?
I feel like as a vegan, you're quickly put in a corner and conflicts arise that you wouldn't have picked up on otherwise.
It greets a harmony-loving vegan (;
This is clearly not an exception under § 312d BGB.
Your #PRS_ORG# does not exempt you from the legal requirements for distance selling.
I'm not at the assigned date when #PRS_ORG# picks up my returns.
Since I can't be there for a funeral, I can't change that.
Can I please be assigned an alternative pick-up date?
As of February 1st, I'll be available all the time.
Lahnsteiner Wehr equipped for water rescue: €45,000 subsidy from the county
Recently, the Minister of the Interior of Rhineland-Palatinate, Roger Lewentz, presented Mayor Peter Labonte with a grant of EUR 45 000 for the construction of a new water rescue vehicle for the volunteer fire brigade in Lahnstein.
The total cost of the vehicle, which has been in service since November 2020, was €135,000.
A good and important investment in security.
I am delighted that the state of Rhineland-Palatinate is supporting us in this", says Lahnstein's Mayor Peter Labonte.
The equipment car is used by the diving squadron Lahnstein, one of a total of seven units in Rhineland-Palatinate.
Above and below the water they perform tasks in water and ice rescue as well as technical assistance.
In Lahnstein, it is expected to increase continuously: The boom in hotel shipping on the Rhine and Mosel as well as the further increasing use of the Lahn as a leisure stream contribute to this.
I bought a book that I could only read 10% of, and then the problems started.
I can't open the book.
I followed your recommendations, however, I synchronized, removed and reloaded the app. Nothing worked.
I'm a little frustrated because the whole operation has already cost me a lot of time and I'm hoping for help now.
Okay, here's the deal.
I'd like to order 3 items from the #PRS_ORG# collection for June.
Can I enter a date during the ordering process?

First of all, thank you for facing the whole thing here, I also spent almost a decade in the civil service in a similar activity, that is, we were also weapons carriers in the executive, I do not want to go into it further!
The question of right and left has always seemed to me to be very simplistic.
But basically you should say that of course the civil servant comes more from the liberal to conservative spectrum and not from the revolutionary left, that should actually be clear to everyone.
That of course also in special uniform and carrying weapons people right from conservative magically dress should also be clear to everyone that these people then of course with the lived reality can be difficult to deal with is of course also clear, because you have of course besides the average white, meanwhile many Germans with a migrant background, women and also homosexuals (and by this I do not mean the exaggerated feminine clichés, because these are in the executive rather less to none but quite normal men and women to whom you do not notice if they do not tell you) and also on these people can rely and I have to rely, because in doubt they save your life or put this one for you.
But even these marginalized groups, although it may sound strange at first, in my experience have a conservative attitude, i.e. they are proud of Germany and feel that exaggerated left-wing politics do not take them seriously, even if these politicians supposedly stand up for them or think they have to do right by them, but they simply want to be treated quite normally.
Returning to the right, since of course the police and the armed forces are also a cross-section of society, you will also find extreme right there, but that they can openly express their opinion there or even openly forge any state-threatening plans is completely exaggerated in the media and annoys me too.
Of course, it happens that even police officers and soldiers who have often been deployed abroad often start to generalize due to negative experiences and sometimes say things that are controversial and even politically incorrect.
It also happens that certain right-wing sympathizers meet and have a lively exchange of ideas.
Nevertheless, in my opinion, this kind of thing is well fought and counteracted by political education and enlightenment!
Germany is so internationally involved and that's a good thing in my opinion that we could not afford to have real racists and Nazis in our ranks!
Yes, which I do not understand, the other basket I also ordered on the German side.
Why would this come from England?
When I ordered it, it wasn't sold out.
I already ordered in November.
It was confirmed to me in your order confirmation.
It's still about my order, which is no longer available.
I was chatting with #NAME# earlier.
Alternatively, could the other #PRS_ORG# basket for #NUMBER# Euro in black still be delivered to Germany or is this basket available anywhere in Germany.
You're the only partner company I can think of.
But at the top of the edge of the wooden part are two deep notches that have been filled with something yellow
And on the mirror itself, there's a small scratch.
Cleaner by child?
Hello, I've been thinking about something for a while.
I'm very disciplined and organized at work (I'm self-employed, very little free time), but all my life I've had a hard time keeping my household clean and tidy.
There's always phases where everything falls apart, and then every now and then it catches up with me and I'm cleaning up and cleaning up.
But it's never the case that someone spontaneously comes to visit.
My husband is (unfortunately) no better either, although it bothers me somewhere but usually household loses simply against work and unhappiness.
The kitchen is still the most regularly cleaned because we love to cook.
Now to my question, did you manage to get any tidier with the baby?
We don't have one yet, but we're working on it, and this question has been bothering me for a while.
Because for me, I have no incentive, it just doesn't bother me so much, as long as no visitor comes and, for example, there are always fresh clothes and the kitchen is usable.
Does having a kid give you more motivation, or does it leave you sloppy?
I look forward to your answers.
Exclusive, new, and high-quality as well as anatomically preformed cut, offers maximum comfort, a perfect fit and thus allows almost unrestricted freedom of movement.
Pre-forming with special further embossing at the joints for improved freedom of movement (at arm and knee bends)
In addition to the Focea Comfort 4, the Flex System 2 has more than doubled the area covered by the Flex System in order to further increase comfort.
Seamless stretch panels at the joints reduce friction (armpits, arm and knee bends)
High-quality preforms in the lower back and in the step ensure a perfectly reclined seat.
Elaskin 8.8 Stretch Panel in the lumbar vertebrae increases the flexibility around the back tear cap and thereby improves comfort, especially when bending and mounting and attaching the equipment to the surface.
The Free Flex Zone located around the shoulders and the back guarantees increased flexibility in the movements of the arms and the back.
Fireskin is a heating, water-repellent material with a special surface structure that provides a high degree of cold protection.
Positioned on the chest, it delivers heat to a sensitive area of the body.
Seamless, thin (-2 mm) seal on the face of the hood increases comfort, sealing and durability (separate head hood)
Soft collar zone improves sealing with fine adjustable width by means of a flexible, gentle zipper that does not adhere to the casing or seams
Double cuffs with zipper on wrists and ankles combine a folding inner cuff with a soft, cased neoprene outer cuff
45° notch at the end of the inner cuff for increased elasticity and resilience when pulling.
Long neck zipper with an elastic reinforcement, for an anatomical cut with increased comfort on the overalls without hood
Long G-Lock P back zipper (all without hood) with metal pusher and built-in water dam system for improved sealing (Beuchat patent)
Arms and legs zippers
Neoprene reinforcements at all ends of the buckles to prevent tearing if excessive force is applied.
Flat-rolled products of iron or non-alloy steel, of a width of less than 600 mm, hot-rolled or cold-rolled (cold-reduced), not clad, plated or coated
The edges of the outer sleeves are lined for greater load-bearing capacity
The edges of the inner sleeves are notched for increased flexibility
The original Beuchat system was designed to hold the computer in place, especially during deeper dives (the system is compatible with all common wrist-worn computers)
Career in social work as someone with an insecure personality disorder?
I trained as a software developer and have been an apprentice for about a year now.
Unfortunately, I'm realizing more and more that this profession isn't right for me, which is why I've been thinking for a while about starting over and studying social work.
The problem is that I have an insecure (or anxiously avoidant) personality disorder.
That means, roughly speaking, that I have no self-esteem and am consequently shy.
I have no problem talking to people on a factual level, but I find it very difficult to have casual conversations and I have been told many times that I seem unapproachable (which I think has improved).
Can I become a social worker?
I don't want to work as a street worker or in an open youth meeting but rather in, for example, addiction counselling or family support.
But I don't know if the actual day-to-day work is really what I imagine it to be, and it's hard to find anything about it on the Internet.
The EPS is already causing problems in my job (for me, emotionally) because it brings me down every time there is something to complain about in my code ("already screwed up the simplest things again") and it is difficult for me to ask more experienced colleagues for help ("I should really know how to do this myself by now" / "I keep him from working with my stupid questions" / "he must really think I am less well-off" etc.).
The problems I will probably have in any profession but I wanted to have mentioned it at the time.
Did you get the couch back yet?
Because there was no confirmation of that either.
I'm waiting for a pick-up appointment.
What do you mean, give it back?
If I downloaded a book to the #PRS_ORG#, the message comes your #PRS_ORG# does not authorize this book
Is there a problem?
I was chatting with #PRS_ORG#, who asked me if I got a delivery receipt for my locker.
In its gastrointestinal tract, the bird breaks down the protein (protein) absorbed from the food into its individual protein building blocks (amino acids) and from these, in turn, builds up its body's own proteins, which it also needs for the formation of feathers.
The formation of feathers in the nestling bird and the regrowth of feathers in the mousing bird are extremely complex processes and involve a particularly high level of stress on the animal's overall organism.
Please note that NEKTON-Bio must not be administered during breeding, as this may interfere with the breeding cycle.
Following this short-term administration of NEKTON-Bio, the daily vitamin supplementation should be resumed with NEKTON-S (multivitamin preparation) and NEKTON-MSA (mineral preparation).

1 g of NEKTON-Bio on 250 ml of water or 100 g of soft food.
It is recommended to prepare only as much drinking water/soft food as the bird consumes daily and to change the water/feed daily.
One painted measuring spoon (inserted) is equivalent to 1 g NEKTON-Bio.
In case of severe damage to the plumage, the initial dose of NEKTON Bio may be doubled or tripled until the onset of plumage regeneration is visible.
The normal dose is then administered until the plumage has fully regenerated.
Storage: NEKTON-Bio should be stored in a dry place, away from sunlight, between 15°C and 25°C.
If you'll excuse me, the chair is sold as an office chair.
How can an office chair break down after nine months?
The warranty period in Germany is 24 months.
This is really very bad service.
Hi, I sent an e-mail on Monday to let you know that my order arrived damaged and pictures were attached.
Did you get this e-mail?
Statement of a municipal employee contrary to the statute
Hello r/LegaladviceGerman, how are you?
I have this problem.
A walnut tree is to be cut down on our property.
So I filed a complaint with the municipality.
An employee writes to me that the felling of fruit trees and therefore the walnut is not part of the statute.
However, the charter explicitly designates the walnut as a tree to be protected.
Can I now rely on the employee's testimony or not?
On the one hand, I have to be able to rely on an expert opinion.
On the other hand, the statutes are clear.
Thank you for your answers.
We understand that.
Then we'll use the new packaging for it.
I haven't received a message.
Well, then I still have a couch I'm not using.
Could you offer me a discount or a coupon?
What was more expensive?
Yes, I think so, but the question is, yes, can I pay in euros and have the blanket delivered to Germany?
Can you verify that?
Emergency report: Major traffic accident at Selb
Recently, a serious traffic accident occurred on the St 2179 between the junction of Selb-Nord and Plößberg.
According to the police's press alert (14:03) a passenger car has overtaken oncoming traffic.
There are wounded.
Ah okay I see.
Well, then, thank you again for making it so easy.
Advice and ideas for further professional life
First of all, Merry Christmas to you!
My Christmas is unfortunately moderately good, because my dear head is currently processing everything that can be processed.
Now, before I say anything else, I need some advice, and it's best to get it from people who know something about my situation, which is you.
I'm doing the ref as a crosstown starter.
Originally, I studied something else and also worked in a field there (to at least remain a little anonymous, I will not name anything more specific here).
But then I got bored with the whole thing, and I started looking for alternatives that might be more fun.
At some point, I ended up in the teaching profession, and I was sure that this was it - even though the framework conditions are much more inflexible than in my previous profession, but I didn't care.
I'm now at the third "I'm Googling other job listings" point.
And it's only been six months.
With the paintings before that, I always decided to go on and at least finish the ref, after that I can still turn around.
But right now, I'm totally done.
I've had so little free time in the last month that I'm completely drained.
It's a vacation now, but there's still a lot of work waiting for me.
Before the rehearsal, I always thought I was stress-resistant, but then my weekend was my weekend, and my night was my night.
It was my day off.
And the stress at work didn't matter in those moments.
Now even the family celebration is too much stress for me.
And then there are these rigid structures that annoy me even more.
Basically, it's fun, and from the outside looking in, the ref is doing well in terms of feedback and stuff.
But I'm completely drained, and I'm wondering how much stress my body can take before it shuts down completely -- if it hasn't already.
I'm wondering if this is how I want to spend the rest of my working life -- especially as I'm reading some of your posts here -- or if I should go back to the old area where I was valued, where I could take time off when I needed it, and the work was kind of boring, but I was paid fairly for it, and I worked together as a team and not as a lone fighter, as is the case now most of the time.
But then I wonder if in a year's time I'll be back where I am now and dissatisfied.
You realize that it's all kind of confusing, but maybe you, as an outsider, have some advice or ideas, like me, about how to get out of this situation where I'm completely exhausted and almost start crying at the slightest thought of it.
I'm not gonna make decisions emotionally right now, and it's probably not gonna lead to anything good.
But maybe your views will help me to at least see a little light at the end of the tunnel - or to be able to enjoy Christmas, that's enough for me for now.
Thank you for reading, and I apologize for the tearful tone.
I hope I've made my situation at least a little clearer.
Since its introduction in 2001, VOX's Valvetronix series has been constantly evolving, resulting, among other things, in the combination of advanced modelling technology with the Valve Reactor circuit, which perfectly mimics the behaviour of a tube amplifier.
With the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X Amps, we're introducing a brand-new modeling engine that is absolutely state-of-the-art when it comes to sound.
Thanks to the VET technology (Virtual Element Technology), which is based on the analysis of the components and amp circuits, the VTX amplifiers come with an authenticity that is absolutely impressive.
Of course, these amps also include the multi-stage Valvetronix tube preamplifier.
This is partly based on real analog circuits, because these just get the sound variations and nuances of a tube amplifier better than any simulation.
In addition to this sophisticated circuitry, the VTX amplifiers feature a closed housing and a bass reflex system from which the natural resonances just bubble forth.
With VOX's Tone Room software, you can even correct and distort historical facts on a virtual level until the amp and the effects sound like you've always imagined.
The perfect combination of tube sound with modelling technology is primarily due to the VOX Valve Reactor technology introduced in 2001.
Of course, it has since been refined several times to meet newly added sound requirements, which in 2010 again led to a performance boost of the VOX Valvetronix series - with more dynamics and numerous and significantly improved amplifier models.
From the handy VT20+ to the VT120+ with two speakers, the new VT+ Valvetronix series has also been designed in such a way that all guitarists looking for maximum sound diversity will find it here.
All guitarists dream of the pressure and dynamics of a tube amplifier: they expect a bold sound, a nuanced reproduction of playing dynamics and strings, and a prompt speech.
During an in-depth analysis, the VOX engineers discovered that the final stage in particular determines the tubular character of an amplifier and developed the VOX Valve Reactor technology on the basis of this finding.
The valve reactor circuit of each VT+ amplifier, fitted with a 12AX7 tube, perfectly reflects the behaviour, subtle nuances and sonic character of a tube amplifier.
NBA: Despite 20 points from Wagner: Magic lose to Clippers
The Orlando Magic's losing streak in the NBA is over.
The Wagner brothers can shine, but it's not enough to win against the Los Angeles Clippers.
Despite 20 points from Franz Wagner and seven assists from his older brother Moritz, the Magic lost to the Los Angeles Clippers 104-106 on Saturday.
The large main compartment is also customizable: with three individually playable and foldable Velcro sections, it completely adapts to the needs of your photographic equipment, making it suitable for all types of cameras - from mirrorless system cameras of all sizes to full-frame SLR cameras.
Of course, what ultimately fits in the backpack depends on the size of the camera and the lens.
A possible fitting would be a DSLR camera with a fixed lens, two to three interchangeable lenses and a flash.
Larger DSLM cameras such as the various models of the Sony a7 series or a Fuji X-T2 still leave room for more lenses.
Besides, there's plenty of room for accessories.
And if you have a small DSLM camera (MFT cameras from Olympus, Fujifilm X-A or E-series) you can use the backpack for your equipment and for things other than photography.
The Everyday Backpack 20L is also an ideal choice for drone pilots, as the backpack offers enough space for a DJI Mavic Pro including remote control and accessories.
The volcanic eruption on La Palma may be the longest in recorded history
In the less than three months since the eruption began, lava flows have caused extensive damage in the Canary Islands.
Is there an end in sight?
Lasting now 85 days, the volcanic eruption on La Palma since Sunday is the longest in the known history of the Spanish Canary Islands.
Until now, the eruption of the Tehuya volcano in 1585 was considered the longest on the Atlantic island off the west coast of Africa, lasting 84 days.
There are no reliable data on previous outbreaks.
Although the activity of the as-yet-unnamed Cumbre Vieja volcano has decreased somewhat in recent days, volcanologists still dare not predict when it might end.
The indicators point to a slowdown.
The best news is that they are stable", the president of the island council, Mariano Hernández Zapata, told state broadcaster RTVE.
Damage in millions
In the less than three months since the eruption began, the more than 1,000-degree-hot lava has destroyed nearly 2,900 homes and other structures, RTVE reported.
Nearly 4,000 acres [1,200 ha] were covered by a three-foot-thick layer of lava.
That's the equivalent of almost 1,700 football fields.
More than 7,000 residents had to be evacuated, and the damage is estimated at more than 900 million euros.
Off the coast, cooled lava created two new islands, totaling about 50 acres [50 ha].
Particularly badly affected was the island's vital banana industry, which directly or indirectly supports about half of the island's roughly 85,000 inhabitants and which was already in crisis before the volcanic eruption.
One hundred and twenty-five hectares of banana plantations were destroyed, and other areas were badly damaged, reported the newspaper El País.
Christmas and the Gifts
Christmas is just around the corner, and especially the children will look forward to the heavenly feast.
The many colorful gifts under the Christmas tree, combined with the spiritual atmosphere and the crackling excitement, have a seductive quality.
Christmas is one of the few traditional occasions that still holds our increasingly divided society together.
It is therefore all the more important to become aware of the Christmas tradition of giving, so that the gesture of giving, which, according to the French sociologist and ethnologist Marcel Mauss, was a peace-making "social contract of indigenous peoples", can escape the rigid routine and be brought back to life in the context of this tradition.
How St. Nicholas Became the Christ Child
Strictly speaking, it was the Protestants who linked Christmas with gift-giving.
Previously, gifts were exchanged on St. Nicholas Day in one way or another.
The background to this custom, which is still popular today, is that Saint Nicholas, as bishop of Myra, secretly threw gold into the windows of three women in one night to spare them another life of sin.
This unconventional form of gift-giving gave rise to the custom popular in Germany of filling children's boots with gifts.
Protestants came across this custom because they rejected mediators between God and man as "saints".
For these reasons, they guard against the institution.
Martin Luther made St. Nicholas the Christ Child and thus established a new line of tradition.
The focus of the gift-giving shifted to Christmas Eve.
However, since most Protestants no longer view such details in such narrow terms, few resent the fact that the custom of St. Nicholas is still an integral part of the pre-Christmas season, just as is the custom of St. Martin's with St. Martin's songs and St. Martin's procession.
Today, everything that the heart desires can be found in boots outside the door and under the Christmas tree, from socks to desirable luxury watches.
Diversity of traditions in Christian lands
Sources attest to a tradition of gift-giving since the 13th century on St. Nicholas' Day.
With the Reformation, the day of giving was moved to Christmas Eve.
In all Christian lands, however, there is joyful gossip as to who brings the presents to the children.
In Germany, it depends on the region whether the Christ child appears on Christmas Eve or Santa Claus, who is basically a kind of Nicholas, to whom some peculiarities have been assigned over time.
These include, for example, his white stubble beard, which has little in common with the rather strict Assyrian beard of the historical figure, his sleigh, which is pulled by reindeer, and the preference of the fireplace to gain access to the houses.
In the Netherlands, St. Nicholas remains the central figure of Christmas.
In Spain, the Holy Three Kings give the gifts, while in Italy it is the witch Befana who is said to have shown them the way to the baby Jesus.
In Scandinavia, mythical creatures sometimes bring the gifts, while in Russia it brought Father Frost some fame.
Here, it's not reindeer, but three horses pulling his sleigh as a troika.
In the Czech Republic, the birthplace of the Reformation in the wake of the Hussite wars, the Christ Child is responsible for the presentation of the gifts.

Police shoot suspected bank robbers near the royal palace
A gunman was shot dead by police near Kensington Palace in London on Saturday.
Police said callers reported a man with a gun allegedly entered a bank and a bookmaker's shop.
Authorities say the man fled in a vehicle that was stopped by officers a short time later.
Shots were fired and the man was hit.
He was pronounced dead at the scene.
The police didn't assume he had a terrorist background.
The area around Kensington Palace is home to several embassies.
The palace is the official London residence of Prince William, his wife Catherine and their three children.
Other members of the royal family also live there.
What's that?

The decorative lamp fits harmoniously into any bed, garden area or rock garden.
The lamp is easy to set up and can be anchored in the ground with 2 earth spikes.
Integrated and powerful 0.4 Watt solar module for optimum charging of the built-in battery.
Duration of illumination not exceeding 10 hours.
- The robust plastic design is suitable for outdoor use all year round.
In the Hollywood spectacle, it's mostly menacing objects from distant galaxies that glow colorfully inside.
On the other hand, Smart Stone is quite harmless: the sun alone ensures that this solar light shines fascinatingly  in either white or colored light (in as many as six different shades).
The edgeless, amorphous design is deliberately chosen: like a naturally shaped large pebble, this modern object of light presents itself during the day.
Its organic curves fit into any natural environment  whether on the edge of the terrace, in the lawn or in the stone bed.
He also does well in the vicinity of larger pebbles and boulders, where he is able to assert himself thanks to his size.
You can save yourself a lot of preparatory work: As a solar light, Smart Stone does not need wires or batteries.
Place the 'lampstone' in any place where the sun shines during the day.
Two supplied earth spikes provide firm support if needed.
The matte-white plastic shell itself is sturdy and weatherproof.
Its solar module hides "Smart Stone" discreetly inside, along with its battery and two LEDs - one for white light, the other for colored light.
The battery is already charging when sunlight hits the housing.
At dusk, the Smart Stone will light up automatically. You can choose which colour to use. There are six attractive colours of light to choose from  besides daylight white.
Finally, the switch-off is also automatic as soon as the battery charge level has fallen to a predetermined minimum or as soon as daylight returns.
As soon as the sun comes up again, the next day's charging cycle begins all over again.
I've done this many times before. It doesn't work.
It's a pity, I would have liked to have ordered more from you, but if the coupon is not credited to me, then on principle I will not order any more.
If you change your mind, let me know.
Otherwise, that's the last contact we'll have today.
Then send me the number for the sideboard.
There's no hardware store open during the lockdown anyway...

The Pill Problem
Hello, ladies and gentlemen,
I hope I'm doing everything right here, after a year Reddit is actually my first post.
About my problem: About five years ago, I started taking the pill again out of necessity, mainly because I had such incredibly bad pain during my period and fucking PMS before my period.
Now I'd like to let that go, because with chronic illness, I have to take enough medication that I can't choose.
My main problem, surprisingly not the pain, but my skin.
I had gone from zero to 100 explosive pimples in my last two-year break, and they were everywhere.
So far, it's been superficial, but it's taken a toll on me, and I haven't been feeling well.
In the two years we've been apart, it's never really gotten back to normal.
Maybe somebody has some tips on how to avoid that this time.
I've already got my perfume-free and non-perfumed cosmetics, but maybe there's something that someone can recommend to me.
Unfortunately, the gynecologist didn't take me seriously, and the dermatologist's still coming.
Thank you very much to everyone who has read the novel!
Yes, dear skin is such a thing.
Had pre-bubble severe neurodermatitis, then a period of rest, then extensive keratitis and the acne issue.
I've tried everything, and I've stuck with sugar, milk, and lean meats, because nothing else has worked so well.
It may be that Hormonell is just the worm in it, but when you have construction sites everywhere like me, you don't want to go looking for anything else that's going wrong.
I've already had all of your colleague's seminars.
Written and now I have lost the conversation and do not know what was answered to my request.
I have to work all the time and answer the phone, and then all of a sudden it's gone...
What's there to check? If the money was there, I'd have seen it.
Please check my bank details, maybe there was a mistake
But does it exist in general in large
Because it's available in a big black one.

In the name of the people: lay judgments
In the courtroom, they sit on the bench in everyday clothing.
But much depends on their judgment, even if they are not wearing robes: Creators determine with professional judges whether and how long someone goes behind bars.
Two of them, Sascha Wickert from Boos and Ruth Ertz from Bad Kreuznach, are two of a total of 125 lay judges at the district court on John F. Kennedy Street.

Could you please send me the invoice from the order number #NUMBER# again to the email address above?
Can we dispose of the packaging material?
We don't have the means to store it for that long.
We'd use the table as they offered it, as if it were our own.

110 kV underground cable to be built in 2022
The authorization for the laying of the new high-voltage cable at Tann is legally binding.
The plan approval decision of the government of Lower Bavaria clears the way for construction to begin in 2022.
This was announced by the grid operator Bayernwerk.
The approximately seven kilometres long underground cable will connect the Tann substation in the north of the municipality and the existing 110 kilovolt line between Simbach and Pfarrkirchen.
The cable is connected to an overhead line tower near the village of Edermanning near Reut.
Good morning to you.
My order of 03.01.21 with order number #NUMBER# has only arrived in parts so far.
The blue postal code: #PRS_ORG# with the consignment number #NUMBER# was returned by #PRS_ORG# with the note "Cannot be delivered".
All three other packages have arrived, so a delivery is definitely possible.
Can you tell me what the next step is?
Have a great start to the week.
You can forget that, I already explained that several times yesterday!!
This is a chest of drawers made of glass, and all the sides are cracked, so there's glass everywhere, and the box is broken.
The dresser is in my apartment and #PRS_ORG# refuses to come into the apartment because of the #PRS_ORG# regulations
That means the dresser can't be picked up because no one's allowed in my apartment.
Thank you for the message.
But why only 20 euros?
The original value of this chair was #NUMBER# EUR
No, it's in all the books, that's why the question on #PRS_ORG#, as it seems to be a general problem
Ref: Scheduling of lessons (EC)
Ladies and gentlemen,
I've been in the Ref since the summer, and I enjoy teaching, but I'm currently having a lot of trouble scheduling my geology class in a timely manner.
Unfortunately, my school is not very well equipped technically, so basically I can only use the blackboard, the textbook and an OHP as a medium.
At school, I can only copy for free (which is annoying for geography).
I just need a lot of time right now to plan my hours.
For example, we're currently working on the topic of geofactors, and for me, every hour counts.
In principle, the methods are always repeated, but on the other hand I do not want to invest too much time in simple lessons (which I also need for UBs, etc.).
When I plan, I always start from the learning goal (what I want to achieve) and then think about how I can build it (usually I create a worksheet with texts from books that my school does not have).
We have the book Terra, and I'm rather unhappy with most of the tasks in the book.
Hence the worksheets.
Maybe I can get a geology teacher to teach me how to use the book in a time-efficient way.
I'd really like that.
I'd like to return the #PRS_ORG# from the order #NUMBER#.
I've actually already decided on a new one at #PRS_ORG# but I'd like to handle the returns as soon as possible.
Retailers are worried about the 2G rule for the Christmas market.
In most shops, only those who have been vaccinated or recovered are allowed in.
Retailers consider this unnecessary and complain of falling sales.
He also has a possible solution.
From the point of view of the German Trade Association (HDE), the 2G regulations are ruining the important Christmas business for retailers.
HDE's chief executive, Stefan Genth, criticised the drop in sales of non-daily items.
According to a recent HDE survey of 1,100 retailers, more than 70 per cent of companies had a negative view of the rest of the year.
A lot of people would have already written off the Christmas business.
"What should have been the positive highlight of the year is now often a bottomless pit", said Genth.
Retailers with 2G access restrictions lost almost a third of their pre-crisis revenues in the past week.
Only grocery retail and online are doing well.
The association called for consequences from the dramatic development.
Shopping with a mask, distance and hygiene concept was a safe affair, the chief executive said.
"2G shopping won't get us any further in the fight against the pandemic", he stressed.
The current regulations discouraged customers and required a high level of human resources.
He called for the strip system to be authorised nationwide.
After that, each customer would only have to be checked once for 2G (vaccinated or recovered) and would have access to all shops on that day with the receipt of the booklet.
In addition, in retail trade, as already in public transport under the 3G rule (vaccinated, recovered or tested), random checks should be sufficient.
The real estate group Deutsche Euroshop, which specialises in shopping centres, also spoke of a difficult Christmas business.
Frequencies were last without 2G at a good 75 percent of pre-Corona levels, revenues at about 90 percent.
These figures will now fall safely in the midst of such important Christmas business", CEO Wilhelm Wellner told Wirtschaftswoche.
Due to the high level of human and administrative effort, efforts are being made to find solutions and obtain approvals for the centres.
This includes the so-called 'band' solution, whereby 'visitors, for example, provide their 2G ID at a central point in the centre and then - equipped with a bracelet similar to that in a club hotel - can enter all shops undisturbed'. dpa
I recently ordered and received the #PRS_ORG#.
There's a scratch on the mirror, and there's also a flaw on the frame, which has been covered with a yellow filler.
This looks bad.
I'd like to return the mirror, and I've already wrapped it up and pasted it back on.
What do I have to do now for the return?
The lamp is designed for dual balance, based on new, flat SMD LEDs with high power and high colour reproduction.
The color temperature and brightness of the lamp are controlled by a modern microprocessor with exceptional capabilities.
In addition to adjusting the brightness, there are two standard color temperatures: daylight and artificial light.
It is also possible to manually set and store the colour temperature in the range 3100 - 5650K.
Use the current settings in the flash memory.
A special feature of the controller is that it is simple and intuitive to use.
The lamp produces a very light stream with soft light of high quality, completely free of flickering.
The 120-degree radiation angle, which allows you to illuminate large areas at a relatively small distance, is excellent.
And by the way, it's also useful in small-scale or short-distance reporting situations.
You can adjust the brightness practically without changing the color temperature.
It's a great tool to use both on set and in the studio.
The optional DMX512 controller allows the lamp to be controlled remotely in television studios or when the lamp is mounted in hard-to-reach places.
On the back of the lamp is the control panel, consisting of buttons and a luminous display.
The display shows the current brightness setting in percent and the current color temperature in Kelvin.
Furthermore, there is the slot for the NP-F batteries (not included in the scope of delivery)
User memory The memory has up to three panel settings for brightness and color temperature.
To carry out the adjustments of the individual settings on the memory slots, simply by pressing one of the memory keys for a long time is occupied and finished.
The memory controller stores the current state of the lamp when switched off, so that the familiar situation is restored when switched on again - Very practical for studio work if, for example, the camera is set to certain color temperatures.
One of the greatest strengths of the DL3120 functionality stems from the possibility of operation with inexpensive NP-F batteries.
These are often already in the possession of photographers and cameramen (and women) - so you can use existing equipment.
The DL3120 can also check whether the batteries have enough power before the set - there is a battery tester built-in - for each of the two battery compartments a value in the two display displays (the left battery on the top display, the right on the bottom display).
In addition, it is of course possible to supply the headlamp with a continuous supply of electricity via the supplied power supply.
The construction of the headlight is very simple.
They have a 16mm housing for attachment as a connector, so you can attach it directly to your photographic tripod.
The inclination shall be reliably adjusted by means of detectors on both sides.
Attention has been paid to the fact that the mechanical components are also of extremely high quality and are therefore also designed for longevity and harsh use.
In addition, an inclined joint is included in the package.
What's great is that there's a bag in the package.
So you can safely transport or store the lamp with all the accessories you might want to buy without any problems.
It's too bad, I got it as a gift and it's too small.
"The party we wanted to throw": Frankfurt celebrates after a strong comeback against Leverkusen
What a spectacular reaction from Eintracht Frankfurt.
After 22 minutes, the Hessians, who had last won twice in a row, were supposedly on their way to the next Bundesliga plateau.
"It's crazy what the guys did today", cheered coach Oliver Glasner on DAZN and said a "general praise to everyone who was there".
At first, it looked like another setback for the ninth-ranked Frankfurters, who were still lagging behind their expectations.
Patrik Schick had put the Leverkusens in the lead with a 2-0 lead.
What happened next impressed the SGE trainer as well.
"How the players came back and gave a fantastic performance", continued Glasner.
I'm incredibly happy with the performance we've shown and, of course, with the result.
Also, defender Christopher Lenz, who was able to stand on the court for the first time since the fourth game day and his muscle injury was overcome, emphasized the morale of his teammates.
"I think our mentality is incredibly great", said the 27-year-old, looking forward to the result, especially for the spectators.
That was the party we were gonna throw today.
For the upcoming tasks, however, Glasner now wants to keep the focus on himself, but also sees himself well positioned in terms of the personnel situation.
It's extraordinary that we have all the players fit in December, that all the players are physically in top shape.
It's top-notch work in our medical department, but the players live a very professional life, too.
Now they want to "go forward step by step and remain humble" and carry out the tasks "at this level" until the turn of the year.
Next on the agenda is an away game at Borussia Mönchengladbach (18.30 p.m., Sky) on Wednesday as part of the English week.
I'm about to get the e-mail that my package is being returned to you due to an error on my part.
I tried to call #PRS_ORG# and get it rerouted, no luck.
Can it be sent directly to me again or do I have to wait until the money is transferred back and place the order again?
Unfortunately for me, that would mean that I won't order again because it's already taken a long time.
Have you ever sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs?
Dampers for women's handball before quarter-finals against Spain
Germany's handball women sneak off the field after the humiliation against Denmark with hanging heads and empty eyes.
At the end of the main round of the World Cup, the DHB team suffered a tough defeat at 16:32 (8:13) in front of 800 spectators in Granollers and must now face the host Spain in the quarterfinals.
"We were much too afraid and had too much respect for the opponent", said national coach Henk Groener.
We have to do things differently against Spain.
After the first defeat in the tournament, Germany finished the main round group III with 8:2 points as second behind the Danes (10:0).
It's too bad we couldn't take the flow with us.
This was a bad game by everyone that we have to erase", said Captain Emily Bölk.
In the fight to reach the semi-finals, a significant increase must be made against the runners-up of the 2019 World Cup next Tuesday, in order to keep the fragile dream of the first medal alive since 2007.
The best German pitcher in the duel with the three-time Olympic champion Denmark was backroom player Alina Grijseels with six goals.
"We just weren't there - neither in attack nor in defence", admitted back-room player Xenia Smits and demanded: "We have to look forward quickly now".
From front to rear not at height
Unlike in the previous five tournament games, the German team was not up to the task.
Misfires and technical errors in the attack and gaps in the defense were responsible for a quick 4-0 deficit after seven minutes.
Only goalkeeper Dinah Eckerle was immediately up to operating temperature and prevented worse with some parades.
The first goal was scored by the DHB team after 9:30 minutes, when Grijseels successfully completed a quick counterpunch.
However, this was not the initial ignition we had hoped for.
Against the aggressive cover of the Danes, the German women could hardly put themselves in the scene - and if they did, they mostly failed at the strong Althea Reinhardt in the gate of the Scandinavian women.
So the game had ended early at 3:10 after 20 minutes, especially since backroom player Mia Zschocke also saw red a little later due to a hard foul on her opponent.
But she'll be back in the quarterfinals.
Only in the final phase of the first half did the DHB selection come into play a little better and by the break at least five goals were approached.
The already faint hope of catching up after the changeover was gone after seven minutes at 9:19.
Once again, the Greener patrons sinned in all areas and made it easy for the well-positioned opponent, who is one of the medal candidates in the final round.
As a result, the German team could no longer rise to a performance increase and left the field as a clear loser.
DACH advent calendar day 6: family traditions during the Christmas season
As part of the Reddit advent calendar, we've embraced St. Nicholas Day and use it as an opportunity to reflect on family traditions during the pre-Christmas season, Advent, St. Nicholas, Christmas Eve, and Christmas holidays.
What was it like back home?
Like with your partner?
Do you want to pass on your traditions to your children?
What's best for the kids?
The boot polish?
You want to bake cupcakes?
The tree ferns?
Is there music?
Is Santa coming, the Christ child, or is the gift from Grandma and Grandpa?
No matter how you do it, everyone goes out of their way around Christmas to make it as beautiful as possible as a family.
Whether these are established traditions or even something different every year, tell us how it went or is going in your family!
Please send me any transaction numbers or anything else that might help.
Confirmation of the transfer, etc.
I'd like to give away a coupon code.
Just like with #PRS_ORG# gift vouchers
Can you do that?
The title says that I work as a vaccination doctor in mobile vaccination teams, in which (so far only) the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine is mainly vaccinated in nursing homes.
Since these will soon be largely completed, part of the work will continue for me in vaccination centres.
I am happy to answer questions without time limit on the organisational and human aspects and also medical questions, as long as they do not relate to you personally (e.g. "I take medicine X, is it compatible with the vaccination..").
In my area of responsibility is the information for the vaccination, the indication status (a person is entitled to a vaccination according to the coronavirus vaccination order and there are no reasons against it), the medical documentation and, if necessary, the emergency care in case of allergic reactions (it has never happened to me).
Vaccination itself can be delegated to qualified personnel, e.g. healthcare professionals.
In vaccination teams, however, we often do not have any, but "only" (for God's sake no lack of appreciation!) pharmaceutical technical assistants for the preparation of vaccines, who, however, cannot carry out vaccinations (are they allowed?), so I also carry out most of the vaccinations myself.
Difficult "Huidler" question: Amberger knows the answer
What is a "Huidlerer"?
With this dialect word, sent by an Amberger, the BR television program "We in Bavaria" has been provided for intense reflection.
However, unlike many previous days, this time the term in the "Host mi?" series was not guessed by the callers.
No, it wasn't "someone who's nervous".
And no one who "needs to do things quickly".
This, people heard about the TV presenter, was completely wrong.
At which the man from Amberg communicated the solution and thus probably also caused amazement among many Oberpfalzers.
"The Huidler", the audience learned, "is a rag with which someone wipes the stove".
Dialect researcher Antony Rowley, interviewed by Bavarian television for years as an expert, confirmed this.
With the note that this is a typical Upper Palatinate term, derived somehow from the more familiar colloquial word "Houdern".
Thus, an educational gap was closed - probably also among some who have been living in the Amberg area for a long time.
I haven't been able to buy books for two weeks.
There is always the following error message after the confirmation: oops - someting went wrong - try again later.
I restarted the #PRS_ORG# gel#PRS_ORG#s, connected to the PC, synced and repaired.
Nothing has helped.
Tire selection on a racing bike - is it really that safe?
I woke up this morning full of energy because I wanted to do at least a little exercise in preparation for my bicycle tour next week.
Said it, done it, and I took off on my racing bike that I bought on eBay yesterday.
The first 40 km were also really nice - but then what happened lurks in every city center (this time: Thanks Krefeld!).
Shards of glass on the track.
Zack, loud hissing, and my rear tire wouldn't go the rest of the way.
Since I had no real opportunity to get a spare coat and a spare hose because of the day of the week, I had to turn around in a half-bad mood and take the first train home.
It wasn't so bad technically, maybe it's better if I practice the tire change again before the bike tour.
But now I'm faced with a question, and I'm hoping you can help me.
Since I have a relatively long journey of several days ahead of me, I would be extremely reluctant to have this problem more often.
Now it was really not bad, since the old tires from the previous owner (a very nice old man, tore off 120 km until 2 pm on the day I came to pick up the bike!) and who had already described them as suboptimal, because he had ridden with them for several years on a roller.
But when I think about the fact that I have to change a tire after driving 80-90kms, then I think I'm really in a bad mood:D
Now I was talking to an elderly man on the platform who asked me in amazement why I didn't have the Marathon Plus tires, since they are supposed to be non-playable.
Now, of course, the whole thing sounds very tempting.
But are they really that unbreakable?
I don't feel like spending $40 on a tire just to be disappointed.
Next thing I know, I'm on a racing bike right now. I think it's 25x622.
There are also (apparently?) with the Marathon Plus tires, but most of them are already wider.
Is that a problem?
Or, for a racing bike, would you advise me on other tires in general?
The swallow side seems to be my absolute!
Thank you in advance for your help and greetings!
Car slams into tree: driver fatally injured
The 53-year-old had been on the B57 between Rheinberg and Xanten with his car for an unexplained reason against a central island and then hit the opposite lane, as the police announced.
There was a head-on collision with the vehicle of a 27-year-old man.
The 53-year-old's car was then slammed into a tree, trapping the man inside.
The 27-year-old and his 23-year-old passenger were seriously injured in the accident and taken to nearby hospitals.
Yeah, we did. We deleted all the books. We re-authorized and uploaded all the new books.

After the release of our new high-end broadband B 100- 6 OHM, it was only a matter of time before our SOLO series would also have offspring.
SOLO 15 is the new offspring and is visually reminiscent of the large prototypes with the B 200 - 6 OHM.
However, this construction proposal directly includes a suitably designed foot to raise the loudspeaker to the correct listening position.
It has no effect on acoustics and can therefore be adjusted in length to suit the conditions at home.
In principle, the SOLO 15 is very well suited for people for whom the maximum volume plays a rather subordinate role, but an exceptionally high sound level is to be achieved.
A four-inch loudspeaker is simply not capable of producing such large sound pressure levels almost unfiltered.
But that doesn't mean that the SOLO 15 sounds weak.
On the contrary, it is remarkably mature and extremely impressive and accurate for its size.
Tonically, the SOLO 15 has been tuned with a slight rise in pitch.
This is commonly used in broadband to optimise the rapidly increasing clustering at frequencies that are too high.
Focused exactly on the listening position, the SOLO 15 impresses with its very clear and fine sound.
When turned slightly outward, the pitch range can be reduced, making the sound picture warmer.
Thanks to the point sound source, the location of the individual components of a piece of music in the optimal stereo triangle is razor sharp and surprisingly precise.
The extremely low mechanical losses of the reference suspect B 100 - 6 OHM provide for enemy dynamics similar to its own.
The SOLO 15 not only complements our SOLO series, but expands it in terms of resolution and accuracy.
As with all our kits, it is advisable to think about the final appearance of the loudspeaker at the beginning in order to plan corresponding changes during construction.
If, for example, the casing is to be lined, the lowering of the loudspeaker must be adjusted accordingly, since the liner again adds material.
After all the boards have been cut (e.g. in a hardware store), an 8 mm hole should first be drilled in the floor plate at the appropriate place, so that the cable can be easily carried there later.
With the help of a top milling machine, the loudspeaker opening in the front now follows, so that the B 100 - 6 OHM can later be used flexibly.
At the rear, this opening should be fitted with a 45° phase to make the opening area of the loudspeaker chassis inside as large as possible.
The four screwing points of the B 100 - 6 OHM are interrupted in the phase as shown in the figure Detail Phase.
Then you start with the actual construction of the box, placing one of the two side walls on a flat surface in front of you.
The back wall, the lid, the front and the floor are now glued to these.
The three stiffeners should also be used and glued.
The reinforcements themselves can vary in material thickness as required, e.g. if you want to use ready-made bars from the construction market instead of making them yourself from 16 mm MDF.
In the next step, the second side is mounted.
Then follow all the plates of the foot, that is, the two sides, as well as the front.
A suitable perforated circular saw or a forester drill will facilitate the attachment of the openings of the bass reflex tube, as well as the connection clamping on the rear wall.
Then a circular grinder is used to round off all the edges of the box itself.
It can also be used to round off the top of the foot plate.
Afterwards, the foot plate is firmly glued to the foot of the housing and additionally screwed with long wooden screws.
This is followed by the marking and pre-drilling (2.5 mm drill) of the screwing points of the loudspeaker chassis and the connecting clamp.
After the housing has been cleaned of wood dust (suction/blowing out), the laying of the cable is started.
The easiest way to do this is through the 35 mm bass reflex opening in the rear wall.
The entire unshortened cable is pushed piece by piece through the 8 mm hole in the foot to the terminal opening, where it protrudes about 30 cm.
In the upper part of the housing, the cable is led to the loudspeaker opening and let it hang loosely there as well.
The frequency selector is then prepared and used.
The construction plan of the frequency switch, as well as the corresponding connection plan, can be found in the following document: Installation instructions Switch Solo 15.
If the frequency converter is installed and the connection terminal is screwed, the 8 mm cable opening inside the box, which is not yet completely closed, is sealed.
Through the 35 mm bASSREFLEX opening, and with a little skill, you can drip hot glue onto the opening and seal it.
By opening the B 100 - 6 OHM and using a small lamp, the sealing can be checked accordingly.
Now we're going to do the dampening as described.
The B 100 - 6 OHM is then attached and screwed with the appropriate screws.
The polarity plays an important role here, so that the plus wire (marked cable) must be soldered at the plus pole of the loudspeaker (greater contact).
Finally, the bass reflex tube is shortened to the specified length of 28 mm (total length of the tube) and inserted.
For damping, a mat of the damping material is cut in two and spread loosely in the housing.
The opening around the bass reflex channel should be kept clear.
Can I place an order now and have it delivered by the beginning of June?
> Hello to all,
> Finally, we can announce that we will be hosting OSCAST again this year!
> Unfortunately, for known reasons, we are unable to get more than four people into the studio, which has meant a higher planning effort and explains the short timing of the announcement.
BUT, there will be at least three people per channel, so we'll be streaming the 2021 Oscars with at least seven beans, and hopefully thousands of you watching!
> We do our best to avoid delays or other problems.
But hey, it's still a pandemic, but we're gonna do everything we can to make the Oscars as entertaining as possible.
> It will start at about 12.30 a.m.
Get your drinks cold, plan a nice meal, and get ready for a long but very interesting night.
