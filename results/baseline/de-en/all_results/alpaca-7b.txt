The item cost less than 20 euros.
The fee corresponds to 40% of the item's value.
I am a #PRS_ORG# customer and therefore it is no problem for me.
I just need to provide either a number or an instruction so that your package can be tracked.
I ordered #PRS_ORG# for 249€ a few days ago.
It costs 179€ today.
I find that very annoying.
Should I cancel the order and place a new one for a better price or is there another way to get a refund?
I generally believe that children should not be expected to take on the parental role for their siblings.
However, I think it is also good for big siblings to take care of the little ones in moderation.
Look quickly, help quickly, and bring the bottle etc.
You are responsible, help in the family and are involved.
As long as they can still have enough children, I don't see a problem.
When your K1 is occupied for a short time and it's okay for him, that's alright.
You can best judge whether it is suitable for your children.
It is not the case that he should wrap K2 and accompany him for hours while sleeping.
It is likely to be right legally.
The psychologist's statement may also be included.
Something should actually happen like a fire, break-in, earthquake, alien invasion, etc. would be too much responsibility for K1 to handle K2.
If you want to take a risk, that is your decision ;)
Please help me to find the title of a book!
I remember reading a crime / thriller a few years ago and I can still recall almost the entire plot, but the title eludes me... Perhaps someone here knows the answer...
The story dealt with fear and how to overcome it.
At the beginning of the story, a zookeeper commits suicide by showering himself with food and going into the enclosure with the raptors.
The case is taken over by a commissioner who, after a short investigation, goes to his therapist's clinic where he treats anxiety patients.
The Commissioner has a small niece who is afraid of fire and this therapist helps her.
More suicides are occurring and there is another protagonist - a photographer who is assigned to the location of each suicide and ordered to document the scene and post the photos online.
In the end, it turns out that this therapist is running an underground therapy group where a chip is implanted in the patient's brain that suppresses their fear center and extreme anxiety is induced.
A woman jumps out of the window intending to commit suicide.
This will be referred to as "the fight" in the book.
At the end there was a great showdown in the hospital that had set fire to.
That is the gist of the action I am sure that the book was written by a French author / authoress.
If someone knows this action or even tells me the title of the book, I would be very happy.
Oh, I don't have the Wi-Fi password available.
My husband must be contacted first.
That could take a while.
What steps should I take next?
Is it possible to get the price difference refunded ?
Kind, four j., Splitter under the fingernail.
Four years, has throughout the entire length of wood splinters under the fingernail (outside).
He tried to pull him with a pinch.
Very difficult to reach.
It did not work and caused pain.
The child reacts hysterically when we try to do something.
No chance.
Tomorrow I am going to the doctor.

Johnson will promote the spread of the flu.
Politics and science in Great Britain are constantly dealing with new Omikron cases.
In England, all qualifying adults should receive an immunization offer on New Year's Day.
Boris Johnson, the British Prime Minister, is aiming to progress faster than ever before with the Corona vaccinations in light of the rapidly rising Omega numbers.
Everyone in England will have the opportunity to receive a booster dose by the end of the year, so long as three months have passed since their second vaccination. This was stated by Johnson on Sunday evening in a pre-recorded video message to his countrymen.
The goal date is at the end of January.
The British government will also provide additional support so that the vaccination campaigns can be accelerated in Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland.
Johnson said that in the face of the Omikron variant, action must be taken immediately to strengthen the vaccine.
The good news is that the protection level can be increased with a third vaccine dose.
Johnson said, "Let's boost now!"
On Sunday, 1239 additional cases of the Omikron variant were registered in Great Britain, resulting in a total of 3137 cases.
Yesterday, there was an increase of roughly 65%.
Will the full amount be refunded from the purchase price upon pickup?
I am for everyone to imagine.
I have sent my application.
The invitation to a conversation was sent via email today.
I will reply to the email.
Unfortunately, his name is not "Peter", but a more complicated one.
I have googled him/her and depending on their cultural background, it is either a man or a woman.
I have no idea how to write the email.
Can someone help me?
I am a foreigner and I will not step over anyone's authority.
Conclusion: Everyone should imagine themselves with pronouns.
I have 5 books.
Four of them are going.
I only bought one thing today, but it doesn't work.
It was obvious that the chair had a hidden defect in its sale.
How can a mattress damage occur after 9 months?
First, I tried on the #PRS_ORG#.
It has been working for about.
14 days.
I always bought the last books from the website and then read them on the #PRS_ORG#.
I bought 6 #PRS_ORG# and wanted to buy 8.
However, there was none left.
Now they are available again and I would like to add two chairs to my order and have the total cost sent to me.
The feeling of helplessness.
Warning: I will be writing in great detail about domestic violence.
I need to write something from my soul.
I (21) often come into contact with victims (and perpetrators) of domestic violence due to my profession.
A topic that bothers me a lot and unfortunately occurs too often is that many victims are not able to help themselves or think we cannot help them.
I am aware that we cannot do everything and it is not perfect.
There are fewer things in my job that move me more than when I can't do anything in such situations.
I see the blue spots, the blood, the desperate eyes...
Even in conversation, with the perpetrator far out of sight and earshot, I cannot reach all of them.
I don't know what the reason is, maybe it's fear, fear of revenge, fear of leaving the familiar social environment, fear of taking away the children from this.
What I always want to make clear, sometimes very close to tears, is that everyone is worth living without violence.
I want all women to know that they do not have to simply endure violence.
I often wish I could help... I know I can't.
It will never get lighter, but it will become easier.
Please always keep in mind that you are worth living without violence, which is incomprehensible important.
What does the series "Arcane" on Netflix teach us about "League of Legends"?
There is a lot of fantasy, complicated names, and an amazing presentation: "Arcane", the series from the "League of Legends" video game universe, has recently been started on Netflix.
Why are we excited for the already announced two seasons?
Basketball Bundesliga: Ludwigsburg suffered a derby defeat to Crailsheim.
At least young John Patrick was gone.
Nothing again: For the second time within three months, the giants lost in Crailsheim - and how!
Ludwigsburg's coach John Patrick said after their cup defeat in October: "We still have some anger in our stomachs."
He didn't lay down after the game, but instead increased his intensity despite the 61:72 (28:38) loss in the Basketball Bundesliga.
When more than the bare result disappointed the manner of appearance.
It expresses the entire dilemma: The triple rate was just 13%, with four hits (all from young Johannes Patrick) on say and write 31 attempts - any more questions?
John Patrick's response was: "We were not focused enough after our victory at Tenerife and did not implement what we had trained."
Move the ball.
Sebastian Gleim reacted differently to his opponent Ludwigsburg: "It was great to win a second time," said the happy coach.
It felt like there were 10,000 people there.
Only 750 people were allowed to attend the Hohenlohe Arena on Saturday, but they still had to pay for it.
Not only due to BBL Topscorer T.J. Shorts, who marked 22 points and guided the game of his team.
The best coach I ever had, Gleim praised.
During Patrick's team, the performers such as Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7) across the line failed.
In the last quarter (22:15), the giants prevented a total disaster and came within eight points of catching up, after they had already trailed by 39:59.
John Patrick arrived with Justin on twelve points.
Fortunately, there is plenty of time to spare.
The Giants will receive the Skyliners Frankfurt at 7:19 pm on Wednesday, before then playing in Ludwigsburg in front of 750 spectators.
We had a different email address, but I changed it.
Yes, I have already reported this several months ago.
Unfortunately, all warranty claims were rejected.
We have informed them legally again and have consequently written to them again.
We originally reported it half a year ago.
Max Raabe will be 59 years old.
He is able to captivate his audience with new interpretations of songs from the 1920s and 1930s.
He is currently traveling with the program "Good Day, Lucky Star" - if he is allowed to appear.
Max Raabe had wanted to celebrate his birthday on stage in Leipzig.
From that nothing.
The concert has been postponed to May 2022 due to government orders to contain the Corona virus.
Other performances that he had planned for the Advent season have had to be postponed, as stated on the singer's website (www.palast-orchester.de) he is 59 years old.
The artists then plan to reschedule their 20
Max Raabe was born on December 12th, 1962 in Lünen, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. As a youth, he enjoyed singing a lot.
In Berlin, he studied opera singing, 1986 he founded together with his fellow students the Palast Orchestra.
Since then, the baritone has established himself with his repertoire of songs and chansons in the style of the Comedian Harmonists.
He was awarded numerous times.
His live album from the "MTV Unplugged" series (2019) reached - just like his successful album "Für Frauen ist das kein Problem" (2013) - the second place in the charts.
He has made it into the mainstream from the niche.
Max Raabe, always immaculately dressed, with his blond hair strictly combed back and mindful of etiquette, is impossible to forget from the current German-language music scene.
With the program "Hello, dear luck" he has been on tour since 20
Hello #NAME#, is it possible to get a small sample of the furniture wood before purchasing?
We can add the existing furniture and so be able to check beforehand whether it matches the color.
It still doesn't work but I can only stretch the cover page but not turn the pages.
Minister of Housing and Urban Development Klara Geywitz: Through expropriation, no new housing is created.
The new Federal Minister for Housing, Klara Geywitz (SPD), has spoken out against the expropriation of large housing corporations, as called for in a popular referendum in Berlin.
When there is an expropriation, no new housing is created, only the ownership structure changes, said Geywitz in an interview with the "Tagesspiegel" (Sunday).
My goal is to give tenants security that their rent will remain affordable in the future.
A varied mix of, for example, private landlords, cooperatives, and housing associations is the best protection against monopolization.
The coalition in Berlin will set up an expert commission to determine how to proceed with the outcome of the referendum.
If the situation is not relaxed, Geywitz is currently in talks with the FDP in the Ampel government about further tightening of the rental law.
The coalition agreement provides for a rent ceiling until 2029, a restriction of rent increases in stressed housing markets, and a widening of the rental spectrum.
I will be speaking with the Justice Minister to implement it as quickly as possible.
Even if the rental market does not loosen up, we will discuss further steps with our coalition partners with the SPD politician.
Hello, I wanted to buy something and after a few days I noticed that I had forgotten the last step in the payment.
Unfortunately, the product is no longer available.
Do you know when it will be available again?
Will it come again?
Storage space (180 cm x #NUMBER#).
Coupon sounds great.
I will open a new order independently.
Thank you for the quick clarification!
When the lamp is sent in March, how long does the shipment take?
I have already cut my finger.
That is incredible brazenness.
At least 100 people have been killed by tornadoes in Kentucky.
During a devastating storm system, numerous tornadoes have swept through the United States.
In Kentucky, there could be more than 100 dead to lament.
The pictures remind me of a war zone.
In the United States, several tornadoes caused extensive destruction and may have claimed up to one hundred lives.
Storms leave a 320-kilometer path of destruction, especially in the state of Kentucky.
Governor Andy Beshear said after visiting the disaster area, "Everywhere the tornado went, it destroyed everything."
Houses, businesses, government buildings - simply gone.
Industrial facilities and roofs are in the trees.
It is difficult to imagine that this is possible.
Kentucky is currently dealing with up to a hundred dead, with the official numbers rising by the hour.
Hello, I just saw that the vitrine #NAME# was sold out.
That's too bad.
Will it be produced?
Is she no longer available?
Is it possible to order this vitrine in another country?
When do you plan to report?
If the delivery cannot be made to my home, I will have to cancel the order.
I understand that, but I can order the roof and have it delivered to Germany, which is in the shopping cart.
I had returned the contact form or had given up on it and was inquiring whether it had been received or was being processed, as I had not received any confirmation.
Companies pay vaccine premiums and change advertising slogans.
While the federal government continues to reject proposals for a vaccine subsidy, companies in Austria have taken the initiative and are offering their employees financial incentives for getting vaccinated.
They are in line with the social partners ÖGB and Wirtschaftskammer, who today called for financial incentives for vaccination.
Even the transformation of advertising slogans into immunization calls - following the German example - should increase the willingness to get vaccinated against COVID-19.
He has changed jobs.
Your situation is not better than his.
Waiting and drinking tea.
It has been one year.
He had clearly not stayed in the same place and was looking for something else.
You may also do that.
And he didn't like you then: who cares.
He didn't like his job either.
There are too many variables.
Please cancel the reservation.
That will become relevant legally.
I am taking a screenshot.

Help with first own campaign.
Hello!
I am currently leading a group of 4 friends on an adventure Over the Greifenpass and want to seamlessly transition them into a custom-written campaign.
We are playing DSA 5.
The great bow has been made, the villains and their motivations have been written, the individual acts have been devised and I am now writing the introductory adventure and stumble already at my own feet.
The premise is that the heroes must drive a wagon of grain from Gratenfels to a small village near the Thuran Sea.
The further action should develop there.
The heroes are to search for a group of goblins that are located some distance away from the village and lure them into a trap.
I want to give the player characters the opportunity to resolve the confrontation in various ways: persuasion, action, intimidation, recognizing the danger early on, whatever the players come up with.
Eight regular goblins, two with spears, six with bows and swords equipped.
The Goblins are lurking in the shadows, waiting for the heroes to pass by in the narrow path. They are armed with bows from left and right, while two of them are holding spears to stop the wagon.
If it comes to a fight and the heroes lose, I have two solutions.
The heroes are found unconscious and subsequently healed by the son of the village schoolmaster, a half-elf.
The cart is of course gone.
If defeat is unavoidable, this half-elf will join forces with two of his servants and come to the aid of the heroes in battle.
The cart is still there, everything is great.
How appropriate is the Deus ex Machina solution from Lösung 2?
Is the Encounter too much of an adventure?
The Goblins will play an important role later on, so they are not just cannon fodder.
I didn't expect so many responses, especially not with so many great suggestions and tips.
I will definitely implement many of your ideas and once again have faith in my narratives.
I took the lamp apart again.
And stuck together again.
Unfortunately, it still doesn't work.
I would still like to send them even though.
Can you come back with the receipts, then I can package the lamp and bring it to the #PRS_ORG#.

I am frustrated with Sky Sports F1.
Hello lovely F1 fans, throughout the season the quality on the German Sky has decreased significantly, so I want to take a break with this post.
First, the F2 race was interrupted midway through to begin the F1 pre-coverage on time.
Despite the delayed start and crash of the time plan, they could still show the last (planned) ten minutes as well as the championship decision (!).
It appears that, for legal reasons, F1 has priority and must be given preference, meaning that Sky DE had no choice but to make compromises in order to accommodate it.
Despite being dumb, Sky UK has ended the race.
Despite a small compliment: commentator Olivier Zwartyes handled the difficult situation around the serious accident well.
There was confusion among the commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, as they did not know that one can change tires under a red flag.
Although there had been situations in Imola, Baku and Silverstone this year, it was not until Hamilton's team radio messages that Verstappen decided to change his tires.
Both Sky UK and RTL knew immediately that this opportunity was available to Verstappen.
I believe basic rules should be known when commentating on a pay-TV F1 race.
It is not the first time a puzzle-solving has been allowed or required, both having constant uncertainties regarding the rules.
Roos's artificial comment style does not please her in general, but it is a matter of taste.
I actually prefer Heiko Wasser from RTL more seriously.
There are constant foolishnesses that simply look unprofessional, like ordering coffee from (equally clueless) reporter Peter Hardenacke or "UuuuuHD" from Ralf Schumacher.
The last one is causing a lot of uneasiness in the comment, which appears to not be taken seriously.
Sky is the only channel that goes into advertising overdrive, as one can only listen to the German audio track without commentary after the race.
Neither ServusTV nor ORF is doing anything.
These two channels make less advertising than Sky, and they are free-to-air channels.
One must praise Glock and Baumgartner for their work, but it does not make up for the drawbacks.
The rest of the programming on Sky Sports F1 is also very sparse and full of repeats.
In total, Sky is the worst German-language broadcaster of the F1.
Unironically, RTL can do a better job with the four races that they are allowed to broadcast.
In any case, the thrilling F1 season makes much less fun than it would with a sensible broadcaster.
I would be interested in your opinion.
On this page: #PRS_ORG#-Pendelleuchte, Messing and multicolored glass x 1
Hello, I have an article that was supposed to be delivered last week and it still hasn't been delivered.
I have contacted the chat twice and so far nothing has happened.
The First Lady told me it would be sent on Monday, the Second Lady told me yesterday that she would check and send it and she has never replied.
Hello, I have ordered two #PRS_ORG# on 12.12.19.
One of them had already displayed a defect (the fabric had a hole at the front of the chair).
I would like help.
Air pumps are excellent for supplying an aquarium with oxygen.
It is also possible to operate a filter system over a conveyor belt.
This series is offered in 3 variants by us.
Look at the bottom of the offer in the table.
You can compare the services here.
Are the pumps strong enough to operate an entire facility?
If you have a large aquarium, it is advisable to use pumps with two or more outlets, so that multiple filters can be connected.
The MK Series has one, two or four outlets, depending on the model, but you can also set an accent in your aquarium, for example, with an air curtain (find them in our shop) or decorations that transform the air bubbles into a function.
Here you could call it a treasure chest, shell or something similar.
The MK series has a special, quiet construction and thus produces low operating sounds.
The installation is very easy.
The vacuum pump is connected to a 4/6 mm air hose...and it can now start.
The fan should be equal to, or higher than, the water level and be placed outside.
The pump should be placed lower than the water level, and a check valve should be inserted between the pump and the water supply.
Cut the air hose and insert the valve between them.
This can be prevented if the water were to flow backwards from the tank through the pump...
If the fan should be installed outdoors, it should be covered and protected from the elements, just like other air pumps.
The MK series pumps are pure power packages that consume little energy.
Although we indicate here on eBay that the processing time is 3 days, the packages are picked up and delivered daily.
Everything is going well, it is going very fast.
We just want to avoid causing anyone to be offended, even if it takes a bit longer.
It would be great if everyone had understanding for the employees who work in the transportation industry...of course, here, Corona isn't an issue.
Please do not rate poorly just because the delivery is delayed, it is solely the responsibility of the delivery services.
Men naturally enjoy complaining about these services, even though we are saying,...they are having a hard time.
This is also very varied regionally.
Never be cruel, stay healthy, and we all hope that there will be better times ahead.
How long does it take to order the yellow with or without armrest?

Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, is sending his astronaut daughter and a space-moderator into space.
The daughter of the first American in space, a TV host and four other passengers have taken a short trip to space.
They were transported on Saturday by the "New Shepard" rocket system of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.
The takeoff and landing of the ten-minute flight occurred in the western US state of Texas.
Under a shining blue sky, Bezos personally welcomed the newly-crowned astronauts upon their return.
Welcome back, said Bezos, wearing a blue spacesuit, as he opened the hatch to the capsule.
Under the applause of friends, family members and colleagues of Blue Origin, the six passengers climbed out one by one and embraced the Amazon founder.
According to Blue Origin, it took ten minutes and 13 seconds to reach a height of 107 kilometers.
Seventy-four-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of the 1961-launched NASA astronaut Alan Shepard (1923-1998), and 50-year-old TV host Michael Strahan were guests of the company, who had paid for their tickets: space engineer Dylan Taylor, investor Evan Dick, technology entrepreneur Lane Bess, and his son Cameron.
Blue Origin did not share how much each person paid for their ticket.
Laura Shepard Churchley remembered after the short flight of her father.
He had to work hard and do everything himself.
She just went along for the ride, said the 74-year-old with a laugh.
Michael Strahan expressed his enthusiasm.
The moderator would love to go back to space again, he said.
New Shepard is expected to reach an altitude of 100 kilometers.
The "New Shepard" rocket system flies largely automatically.
The detached capsule reached an altitude of around 100 kilometers above the Earth, experiencing weightlessness before the reusable object was brought down by parachutes.
The International Air Transport Association and many other experts view 100 kilometers above the Earth as the boundary between Earth and space, but there is no definitive international regulation.
Blue Origin's third manned flight was in July, when Amazon founder Jeff Bezos was on board with his brother Mark, a 82 year old former US pilot, and a 18 year old Dutchman.
At the second one in October, the 90-year-old Canadian actor William Shatner was present, who became world-famous for his role as "Captain Kirk" in "Star Trek", as well as the former NASA engineer Chris Boshuizen, the founder of Blue Origin, Audrey Powers.
Critics have accused Bezos and Blue Origin of pursuing space tourism largely without scientific research interests in mind and without regard for the climate.

Someone who works or studies biochemistry.
I am currently studying biochemistry in my first semester and I find the subject quite interesting. In the lab, I don't get distracted and I have already completed my organic chemistry practical.
I had also thought about career prospects at that time, but I was still sure that I would keep studying until I got my PhD.
I am having doubts, especially concerning my professional prospects.
On one side, one always hears about great job opportunities and the job is highly sought after, but on the other, one hears about unemployed biologists and incredibly poorly paid positions.
That would really interest me:
What are you currently working on?
Are you satisfied with your job/salary?
What have you studied/ What kind of education have you made?
Would you do it again?
Thank you for your answers!
I am currently uncertain and am considering abandoning my studies and pursuing an apprenticeship as a computer scientist.
If you have experience, please share it.
Extra Stress for Holidays & Weekends
This topic came up last week.
I had to use this long weekend to relax.
Now I'm going to nail it down.
Not only during big holidays, such as Christmas holidays, there is a lot of stress at our workplace.
It appears there are also bridge days before holidays.
It was like this: Last week was Mary's Ascension, which is called "Auffahrt" in Switzerland.
On Friday, most people and businesses take a day off, although it is not an official holiday.
Last weekend was a long 4-day weekend at home.
What happened last week?
Stress everywhere.
Several urgent emails needed to be sent before the weekend, assignments here and there, everything had to be done before the long weekend.
Why?
Why can't it be next week after so much time sounds?
Why do people want to accomplish so much in a short week as if it were a normal one?
I was both stressed and annoyed on Wednesday.
Why are you self-censoring for holidays?
What holidays do we still have left if we don't get to enjoy them properly?!
The stress was noticed, the colleagues were all self-sufficient in dealing with it.
My question is simple: Are we the only Swiss?
Is this our reformed-evangelical art?
Do you know that up north?
Yvonne Catterfeld is looking forward to Christmas in Thuringia.
Yvonne Catterfeld (42) is looking forward to Christmas in her Thuringian homeland - but has not yet bought any presents.
The beautiful, even if there should be no snow in Erfurt, one should still go to Ilmenau in the Thuringian Forest, said the actress and singer Hit Radio FFH.
You will agree to the festival by baking and decorating cookies with your son.
I love it, said Catterfeld.
She still had some things to do until the sensible days: "For the first time, I have no gifts to give, I must finally get rid of them".

NEKTON-Bio contains all essential vitamins, amino acids, minerals, trace elements and 200,000 µg biotin/kg.
Bio provides the bird with a smooth and shiny plumage.
Most of the feather damage that occurs in bird-keeping is due to nutritional deficiencies.
The feathers of a bird are made from protein-rich substances, which is why a balanced and abundant protein diet is essential for the formation of a flawless feather.
For a functioning metabolism, daily nutrition must contain adequate vitamins, minerals, and trace elements.
Most of the losses of animals during the molt are due to inadequate or imbalanced protein intake and/or vitamin and mineral deficiencies.
At the composition of NEKTON-Bio, the unfavorable ratio of amino acids in most plant-based feeds is specifically taken into account and balanced.
During the use of NEKTON-Bio, no other vitamin supplement should be administered.

Thank you, I have found it.
It is still not working.
This sentence translates to English as "DDR-Model Workshop Locomotive E-Lok E 95 03 DRG/ DR, which was used in Saxony and Central Germany, is a very rare locomotive from the modeler's ME Heft 11/1968 kit, with play tracks and missing parts as seen in the photos, it functions well, the E 95 is a heavy freight electric locomotive of the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft (DRG), designed to haul heavy coal trains in the Schleswig-Holstein network, possibly coming from the small-scale company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN.
A locomotive is located at the DB Museum in Halle (Saale) and is operational.
The Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft had commissioned AEG to propose an electric locomotive that could pull 2.200-tonne coal trains and 530-tonne passenger trains at a speed of 45 km/h.
The maximum speed was required to be 65 km/h.
In March 1926, the DRG ordered 1'Co+Co1' locomotives with Tatzlager-drive from AEG, with Siemens-Schuckertwerke supplying the mechanical and electrical parts respectively.
From December 1927 to June 1928, six locomotives were delivered with the numbers E 95 01–06.
Everyone survived the Second World War and found themselves on the territory of the later DDR.
In 1946, the locomotives were sent to the Soviet Union as war reparations.
They returned to Germany until November 1952.
At the Reichsbahnausbesserungswerk Dessau, the readiness of all six locomotives was established.
As the electrification of the middle German network progressed, a growing demand for locomotives for heavy freight service arose. In 1959, the three locomotives E 95 01 to E 95 03 were overhauled, while the remaining machines served as spare parts donors.
First, the available E 04, E 44 and E 94 pieces were preferred for construction.
When looking at the E94, it became clear that the processing number could not be increased any further, so the E95 came into focus of the processing.
At first, the locomotives were stationed in the Leipzig-Wahren railway workshop.
They arrived at the railway depot in Halle P in 1960.
They were usually assigned to haul coal trains from the Geiseltal towards Halle, Leipzig, and Erfurt.
It became increasingly difficult to control the locomotives with age.
It is often the case that shooters get stuck with sticky hands after handling ammunition.
The conductor, who was always travelling on the locomotive, had to unlatch the shutter with a hammer and an axe during the journey.
Damage to the engine frequently occurred and resulted in months-long failures of the locomotive.
By the end of the 1960s, there were enough new locomotives available and an expansion of the electric service was not planned, so the Reichsbahn was able to retire the E 95 class locomotives.
It was discovered that the Deutsche Reichsbahn only wanted to operate their electric locomotives with a single engineer, due to the mentioned difficulties with the machines and the poor visibility from the cab, which could have caused a problem in the train operation.
After mid-1969, the E 95 02 and E 95 03 were taken out of service, followed by the E 95 01, which quit the service on October 5th, 1970.
The intended new name 255 001 was never used.
All locomotives were dismantled on the E 95 02.
The E 95 02 was installed as a replacement for the future museum locomotive E 77 10 as a switch heating facility at the main station in Halle.
It took some time for the authorities at the Reichsbahn to be convinced that the E 95 should be preserved as a museum locomotive.
In 1979, the initial processing of the locomotive began with the goal of presenting it in a vehicle show in RAW Dessau.
She had been part of the Dresden Transport Museum as a non-operational museum locomotive since.
In 1986, the interior of the locomotive was completed.
The DB Museum in Halle (Saale) is taking care of the locomotive in a museum setting.
Since 1995, employees of the Traditionsgemeinschaft Bw Halle P have been working to make the locomotive operational.
In April 2015, the locomotive was presented at an exhibition in the Museum-Bw Arnstadt with a new internal and external livery, where the transformers were checked and five traction motors were found to be operational.
The locomotives stood until 1945 on the Silesian Mountain Railway and its branch lines in service, where they proved their reliable drive and low maintenance.
In February 1945, the machines were relocated to the central German network.
The main area of operation was initially Schlesien.
The English translation for this sentence is: This handcrafted model H0 is functioning well, it needs optical adjustments to the loco in self-work, dusty, with play tracks, cellar smell !!!, possibly comes from the small-series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN.

I cannot build the bed.
The beam is held by two feet, which are unfortunately defective.
The center beam does not fit into the designed holder.
I also receive new ones.
When will they be sent?
No flat.
According to the assembly instructions, these are the correct ones from the form, they were only too narrow.
That doesn't matter.
The main thing is to fulfill their purpose.
With you, they are not shallow.
Could I have received this?

A house fire with two light injuries and significant damage.
Two people were slightly injured in a house fire in Upper Bavaria.
In addition, a considerable damage in the six-figure euro range was reported by the police on Sunday.
The fire had spread from a carport onto the adjacent house in Kinsau (district of Landsberg am Lech).
According to the reports, two people were brought to the hospital on Sunday with mild smoke inhalation.
The exact cause of the fire was initially unknown, but the police suspected arson.
The Kripo Fürstenfeldbruck has taken over the further investigations.
It eventually comes later.
And I have to pay shipping costs again.
Weakening Fake News - Biontech CEO Publishes Vaccine Photo
Uğur Şahin published a photo of his first vaccination in early 2021 on the social network LinkedIn.
Biontech-Chef Uğur Şahin has not yet publicly commented on his vaccination status.
The entrepreneur published a photo showing his Corona vaccination.
His illness prompted him to share the news with Şahin.
The CEO and co-founder of the Mainz-based company Biontech, Uğur Şahin, has published a photo showing him receiving a vaccination against the Coronavirus.
There were false information circulating on social media that I was not vaccinated.
My wife and I have received 3 doses of the Biontech-Pfizer vaccine, as Sahin wrote in a post in the "LinkedIn" network on Friday.
My friends have been urging me to post a photo of myself getting vaccinated in order to counteract these false rumors.
He rejected it because the communication should not revolve around him.
I was deeply saddened to learn that an old school friend of mine is currently battling for his life.
He is battling a severe Covid-19 illness and has been hooked up to a ventilator for the past three weeks.
His friend and family have not been vaccinated, wrote Şahin.
He did not ask for the reasons.
The most common cause appears to be fear, which is often fueled by false information and mistrust.
It is difficult to fight anxiety with facts, sometimes it is better to share personal experiences.
An interview with Uğur Şahin, in which he says he is not vaccinated, is circulating on the internet.
However, the video was created in December 20
It is not legally permitted to obtain the vaccine at present, said Şahin then.
In Germany, there is a priority for the administration of vaccines.
The priority has been rescinded - and the Biontech CEO has reportedly been vaccinated three times.
Fire in transformer station: Thousands of people without power.
In several municipalities in North Rhine-Westphalia, the power went out on Friday evening: no electricity and in many cases, also no heating.
A fire had disabled a switching station.
Thousands of people in the Rhine-Sieg district of North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany were without power for 24 hours due to a fire at an electrical substation.
On Friday evening, 41,000 people and residents had their lights go out in several communities.
The provider Westnetz reported that numerous backup power sources had been in operation until the widespread disturbance was finally brought to a complete conclusion late Saturday evening.
Firefighters and helpers of the THW provided assistance in the communities.
The authorities offered childcare places in schools and called for neighborhood help.
The provider thanked the affected people for their patience and thanked the helpers for their effort.
We are aware that the last 24 hours have imposed significant restrictions.
We would like to thank the affected communities, the county, the fire departments and the THW for their tireless effort, stated Florian Witt, head of the Primary Technology area, in a statement on Saturday evening.
It will take some days to repair the damage, as the Westnetz engineers were only able to provisionally restore some of the damaged cables.
A technical defect caused the fire, according to the company's statements.
The river is flowing again.
The fire that broke out on Friday at 19:15 according to Westnetz's information has reportedly damaged parts of the 10,000-volt switching station in Neunkirchen-Seelscheid.
There may be expensive cleaning and repair works necessary.
In addition, a connection to a 30,000-volt voltage level was created.
With the help of this bypass, the power supply is restored.
Since Saturday at 6 pm, over 21,000 people in Much and Ruppichteroth had power.
An additional 20,000 people from Neunkirchen-Seelscheid were switched on at 21:30.
Since 11:15 PM, the last affected people still had power.
More than 80 workers from Westnetz and partner companies were involved.
The authorities had called for neighborhood help on Saturday afternoon to set up a backup power supply for important buildings.
It is important for citizens to take care of their elderly or solitary neighbors and to inform the local fire stations when help is needed, explained Landrat Sebastian Schuster (CDU) after a crisis meeting.
When setting up and operating backup power generators, the focus was primarily on the residents of nursing homes.
In addition, temporary care places in schools were set up for those people who could not take care of themselves or who needed power-dependent medical equipment or medical supervision.
Hello!
Unfortunately, the roof in Germany is sold out.
Can I buy it from you and pay in Euros?
It is about the blue-green roof #PRS_ORG#.
I hope you have a beautiful day and stay healthy ♡
I can't mount it on the tabletop.

There are three versions.
We wanted those tabletops to have a diameter of #NUMBER#.
We have received a diameter of 155cm.
My #PRS_ORG# arrived today, but I cannot squeeze it in and shorten it.
Can you help me further?
I would have to send them back, since they are not suitable for the purpose.
I would be delighted to receive a response.
That is really easy!
Then we will do it!
Could you please send me the return receipt by mail?
The repair is now complete.
I had already tried to do it before the chat.
I had not restarted the E-#PRS_ORG# before the purchase.
Should I do it now?
I find it almost shameful to get such a low discount.
We are not in agreement with that.

In order to ensure even and smooth application, you should clean the parts with some soapy water to remove dust, fat and fingerprints, rinse with clear water, and dry thoroughly.
Before you bring the paintbrush to the model for the first time with a new color, it is advisable to practice 2 to 3 strokes.
You can do it on the hidden inner side of the components or on a yogurt cup.
The first stroke on the component.
Draw evenly spaced lines beside each other.
Light overlapping of color layers later results in a even surface.
He swiftly wiped back and forth with the brush.
That creates unrealistic surfaces.
A model is not a garden fence.
Start with the bright colors.
The dark ones could appear later.
Metallic tones and colors finish off with a separate brush.
It can lead to unsightly metallic sheen when mixing normal colors.
Let the painted parts dry for one day before you sand them.
The models can achieve a realistic look through the decals or stickers.
Emblems on aircraft, ships, and automobiles: Decals give the model the final touch.
Apply the decals in the correct order until the parts are still reachable.
A plane's cockpit can be furnished before it is installed in the body.
More important than the right tool such as a saw, pincette and scissors are time, patience and a steady hand.
Cut out each necessary decal and lay them out for you.
Decals are also called water shifting pictures, because you just need to wet the back side of the paper with water until it becomes dark.
You tear off a small piece of paper and place it on the corresponding spot on the model (which you have previously moistened).
While you are holding the decal in place with a tool, you are pulling the backing paper sideways.
Check to make sure the picture is in the correct position before you completely remove it from the paper, so that it does not stick, knit, or tear.

The lamp arrived in three separate packages at my place.
Despite everything, thank you very much!
As soon as I have the money back, I will buy elsewhere.
Will I be able to solve the problem?
Childhood treatment for PKV / What is an "insurance case"?
Hello everyone.
We were in the fertility clinic for a while, now that it's time to settle up with the health insurance, suddenly this pops up.
One by one:
We had applied for the fertility treatment in advance and were granted permission for three attempts.
The experiments were not restricted in any way (e.g. by time frame, success, etc.).
The first attempt resulted in a successful pregnancy and birth, which was settled with the PKV.
Several months later, we tried to get a second child, but had two (unsuccessful) attempts, but did not count these with the PKV.
We applied again for coverage from the PKV and were granted three additional attempts.
After a few more attempts (we had conducted more experiments than we had promised, logically the most expensive ones were with the PKV), we submitted the bills to the PKV and got the bad surprise: instead of 5 experiments (2+3), the PKV will only pay for 3 experiments.
Explanation: With pregnancy/birth, the other two attempts of the first offer are lost.
The second child wish is a new insurance case.
The insurance case begins with the treatment, it ends when the treatment is no longer necessary.
The experts in the room are being asked questions.
Who is entitled to receive three attempts or five attempts?
The PKV should have warned us that further attempts would be fruitless after a birth.
Is the wish for a second child really a new insurance case?
Infertility (resulting from blocked fallopian tubes) cannot be healed by the first child.
It would be great if the experts here could give their opinion.
Thank you very much for your help!
Could you please send me the three variants by email and tell me how I can best achieve them?
In order.
We will not be ordering anything more from them.
When my friend #NAME# and I add our transactions together, it is obvious that they have lost a good customer.
They would like to forward it to their manager.
This is not competitive.
Yesterday, my colleague told me that the refund was initiated and now you are telling me that I need to send the thing back.
I can't do anything about it if the dresser arrives completely destroyed.
Please take a look at the screenshot to see what your colleague has written.
It is clear and evident that the refund was initiated and I have still not received a refund from #PRS_ORG#.
You can inform your manager that you have lost two regular customers.
My friend has also ordered various furniture for our apartment through his account.
We will not be doing that anymore.
No, the defect has only recently appeared.
A swivel chair must be able to withstand normal use.
They are not allowed to sell him as a office chair.
Regardless of that, the guarantee is valid for 24 months.
No, I am not able to obtain another type of packaging.
I will take the cabinet apart and be able to provide it to the transport company.
Hello, I have a question about your series of #PRS_ORG#
These products were advertised with additional purchase incentives, but we were unable to find them with you.
Can you help?
The topic of the week: The best low budget films.
What is a low-budget film exactly? There is no general definition with exact budget limits.
Wikipedia has the following to say:
A low-budget film or low-budget movie is a motion picture shot with little to no funding from a major film studio or private investor.
You can find plenty of low-budget films on Letterboxd.com, such as on Netflix.
Do you know any interesting representatives of this category?
What are you doing?
What do you not like at all?
You have been a very good customer, having already furnished two apartments with your furniture.
I wanted to ask the best price for the gray leather sofa Odelle.
The delivery time was extended again, is this now reliable?
Thank you very much.
With friendly greetings.
There is no telephone number, a chat, where one has to wait for 30 minutes, is not a chat!
Unfortunately, nothing changes the waiting position...I will give it another try, as it might just work here.
Hello
The battle against Belarus is associated with high costs for the EU.
According to political expert Raphael Bossong, the EU can declare a "half victory" in the conflict with the Belarusian regime.
The costs were very high and meant massive violations of the rights of migrants and refugees at Belarus's border with Poland and Lithuania, said Bossong to the Evangelical Press Service (epd).
The EU has not resolved the conflict, according to a researcher from the Berlin-based SWP Foundation.
This state of limbo - Belarus does not give up completely, but the EU feels like the winner - will probably continue for a while longer.
The way people are treated at the border is not in accordance with the European Convention on Human Rights, according to Bossong.
It appears that there is an increasing normalization of pushbacks by individual EU governments.
If the EU as a whole is not decisive in opposing this, it will come at the expense of fundamental rights.
This development weakens the unity within the Union.
Poland is currently preventing Frontex, the EU's border security agency, from accessing its border, even though it is supposed to be able to do so.
In addition, the EU pays a price for its policy at the border with Belarus, according to Bossong: A consensus on asylum policy has become more difficult, as the line "border protection, border protection, border protection" has been strengthened.
Attempting to cross the border again.
According to Poland's border guards, migrants have once again attempted to cross into Poland from Belarus.
Fifty-five migrants were apprehended in the night of Sunday and brought back to the border, said a spokesperson for the authority on Sunday.
The Polish officers were attacked by the migrants near the place Czeremsza with stones.
According to the information, a soldier was struck in the face and had to be medically attended to by a military doctor.
The Border Control registered 52 attempted crossings within 24 hours.
On Friday evening, a group of 28 migrants had crossed the border.
Thousands of people from countries like Iraq and Afghanistan have attempted to cross the border between Belarus and the EU in the past months.
The EU is accusing Alexander Lukashenko of being the leader of Belarus, luring them with the prospect of entering the EU.
According to press reports, Poland and Lithuania have sealed off their border sections.
The EU sanctioned Belarus and threatened airlines for bringing migrants and refugees into the country.
In addition, EU Commissioners travelled to the countries of origin of the people, in order to prevent them from leaving.
The most effective element of the EU reaction is the pressure on the airlines, said Bossong.
The EU has thrown its market power into the scales and demonstrated its determination by applying harsh bandages and extraterritorial sanctions.
Minsk must take into account internal political costs.
The Belarusian society is not prepared to have the state security apparatus routinely herd thousands of people through the country.
Mercedes protested the controversial Formula 1 finale.
Max Verstappen is believed to have committed two rules violations during the race.
After the controversial Formula 1 finale in Abu Dhabi, Mercedes has filed an appeal.
They suspect two rule violations in the last Grand Prix of the year.
A protest is brought against Max Verstappen for allegedly breaching the rules during the safety car phase when he overtook unsafely.
A second protest was lodged against the final race result.
No one followed the protocol correctly after seeing the Mercedes.
Verstappen had overtaken Lewis Hamilton on the last lap to win his first Formula 1 title.
The maneuver was performed shortly after the conclusion of a safety car phase, in which the Dutch car ahead of him had been overtaken.
I am checking.
I am speaking with the bank and re-registering with you.
Thank you for the support.

Problems with glass fiber + Devolo DLan/Magic.
We have had a new fiber optic connection in the house for a few weeks.
Unfortunately, I am having difficulty setting up a stable Wi-Fi network.
Previously, I had a DSL 50 Mbit connection and I used the Devolo DLan, which has been reliable and has received and sent 50 Mbit without any issues.
The new fiber connection sends 500 Mbps to the FritzBox 7590 and the DLan module, which is connected to it, also receives these speeds.
Although the other module, which transmits WiFi, does not send the full 500 anymore, but the further I stay in the house with the module, the less WiFi it sends (using a power outlet which is 1, 2, 3, etc. rooms away from the other module).
This leads to the fact that the internet with the new fiber connection is now even slower than before (\~45 Mbit).
I have also ordered a new Devolo Magic Set, which appears to use a new technology.
This was better than the DLan, but there were still considerable losses.
Could someone explain why so much internet speed is lost through the power line?
Is there really a solution?
It would be expensive to install a LAN cable in that house.
I am at my wit's end, so I created an extra account here.
I would be delighted to receive an answer.
When it is time to switch the Giro account.
He who thought he would find rest among his accounts, is deceived.
While many banks have been using the fall to confirm past fee increases with their customers, negative interest rates continue to decline.
The Deutsche Bank, for example, was considered generous with a limit of 100,000 euros.
She has just halved her bonus and even quartered her daily allowance.
In the first step, the limit was lowered to 50,000 euros for Giro and investment accounts and 25,000 euros for current accounts.
However, these lower interest rates now apply to the entire German Bank, as a spokesperson confirmed upon request.
Not only for new contracts, but also for "renewed individual agreements with existing customers".
Commerzbank had previously gone down to a limit of 50,000 euros, which is still in effect, as well as for ING Germany.
Direct bank DKB, which is popular with cost-conscious customers, has lowered its bonus levels in two stages, first to 50,000 euros and now to 25,000 euros.
More than 100 banks according to the Internet portal Verivox currently offer a bonus of up to 25,000 euros.
The Sparda Bank Berlin has arrived at 25,000 euros: However, there is still a legal dispute with the consumer centrals, which won the first instance court case against this regulation.
It is already being discussed in the banks whether they should make provisions - in case the higher authorities declare the negative interest rates to be unlawful and many millions of bank customers have to be refunded.

Jennifer Aniston is employing an entire beauty army.
She is now officially at the top of Hollywood.
Your life is like a journey up and down a mountain.
Jennifer Aniston (52) was chosen by the US magazine "The Hollywood Reporter" as the most influential woman of the year.
For those who made a splash in 2021 with the "Friends" reunion and the continuation of their series "The Morning Show", this success is primarily due to hard work and discipline.
An entire army of assistants, stylists, and trainers are concerned with your appearance.
At least, Aniston, give yourself one chip a day (yes, properly read: one single chip from the bag).
That your hearts, both female and male fans, will still fly, is truly a miracle.
Perhaps because she is unlucky in love - and still searching for the great love.
He removed the baby's wish from the list.
In the past, she was constantly asked when she would become a mother.
It hurt her.
The people who asked had no idea what was going on with me medically, why I couldn't.
It was really hurtful.
Hope that success and fame will bring happiness.
Unworthy End of a Career: Räikkönen Must Retire
Kimi Räikkönen's departure from Formula 1 was quieter than expected.
Abu Dhabi - The 42-year-old Finn took off his gloves and wiped the sweat from his brow.
That was it.
After a driving error and a light contact with the barrier, Räikkönen had to retire from the Grand Prix of Abu Dhabi halfway through the race due to his Alfa Romeo.
It was his 349th and last Grand Prix, the "Iceman" ending his career in the motorsport kingdom.
His wife Minttu and their two children had also gone to the United Arab Emirates for the farewell.
Räikkönen's greatest success was winning the 2007 World Championship in a Ferrari.
He achieved 21 Grand Prix victories, started 18 times from the pole position, and finished 103 times on the podium.
Friedrich has won 60 World Cups - Nolte has won the two-man bob - Sport
Ole Einar Björndalen's 94 victories is the goal of the bobsled team.
I have calculated that I need to win nine and a half races in a season to have a chance of making it to Cortina 2026, said the double Olympic champion from BSC Oberbärenburg, who achieved two victories in two days at the races in Winterberg.
On Saturday, he fended off Johannes Lochner's attack by 0.5 seconds, moving up from third place to first.
He changed something in the material setup and drove away with a 0.30 second lead on Sunday.
With his team Thorsten Margis (SV Halle), Candy Bauer (BSC Oberbärenburg) and Alexander Schüller (SV Halle), he defeated the British Brad Hall.
The Austrian Benjamin Maier was born third.
Friedrich said, "We have taken on greater risk today and have been rewarded, with my 22nd consecutive victory."
John Lochner, who was driving to Stuttgart, came in second place this time around.
Christoph Hafer from BC Bad Feilnbach finished fourth in the first race and placed eighth overall.
If I knew what he was doing, I would do it too, said Lochner.
Nolte with home victory - platform for Jamaica
Laura Nolte brought home the third season victory in the two-woman bob.
After coming in fourth the day before, she roared to a world cup victory on Sunday with the help of her anchorwoman Deborah Levi.
Mariama Jamanka from the BRC Thüringen bobsleigh team came in second place with Germany's fastest sprinter, Alexandra Burghardt from Burghausen.
She booked her Olympic qualification as well as her first podium finish this winter.
The Wiesbaden resident Kim Kalicki finished third with Leonie Fiebig.
It was super cool to me to be the first place in the World Cup, I am super happy that Mariama is taking me with her.
I am very happy with the development.
There is still a lot of potential at the start, but the start times today were okay, said Burghardt and emphasized: "It's not just about pushing, but there's also a lot to do elsewhere.
She was irritated by the not entirely error-free journeys, but she said: "It's going in the right direction."
I had the ceiling in my shopping cart and could now buy it!
What should I do?
I haven't received it yet and couldn't cash it out so I finally asked.
Last year I had different problems and no time for it.
And now it was said that I was finished, which made me very angry.
They discussed the sofa in the chat.
I would like to return it and then order it again since it is on sale.
Why is the shipment not started until March 16th?
There is nothing on your website about delivery times.
Not until I press the enter key will a new field appear with the message.
Your colleague took it away yesterday.
Why is there a problem today?
I have also sent you pictures of the wrong item.
We still want the dresser even though it is damaged, a new undamaged one.
Do not cancel the entire order.
Only this day, only this week, only until XY...
Hello beautiful ladies and girls,
I want to write something and maybe it will help someone else too...
I am 24, I have a part-time job, and I am a student. Additionally, my dog does not bark or go to the kindergarten, but he is still my child.
My friend (since 6th grade) is sick, he got a second-degree burn on Monday and has been depressive (but is now in therapy).
Yesterday I visited him because I also have emotional needs and I wanted to see and feel him. We cuddled a lot and it was nice.
I helped him shower because his hand was bandaged due to burns.
He is also cold and we see each other less frequently (1-2 times a week) which makes me very uncomfortable with regards to affection and love.
My dog is feeling sick, so I cooked for him and now he is lying in his comfy blanket and has relaxed after I gave him some warmth and petting.
I am living with my sister and mother, and she is away for a month.
Now, it seems, we also have to do housework, which we will have to divide among us.
Cooking is a lot of work for me...
My illness is going well, I am halfway through the treatment and am managing okay.
Not good, but I am managing and am almost symptom-free.
My university requires a lot from me, tomorrow I have a written test that I haven't prepared for, and I should at least prepare something for my Anatomy class the next day.
I have an oral exam next week, and what happens then is written down in my calendar and not in my head because there is no more room.
My week is going by quickly: Only until tomorrow, then it's the weekend.
After that, what happens?
Only until the birthday.
Only until the beginning of the holidays.
Only until the weekend.
Only until...
And so it goes on forever.
I believe I am just so stressed out that I need these mental cues, otherwise I will just give up.
I sometimes feel guilty and "chaotic", but I can't seem to manage it...
Does it also go for you?
I am infinitely grateful that I do not have to work.
I am infinitely grateful; I cannot express it in words.
I don't know if I would have survived my captivity.
I believe this has something to do with mental load for women and that's why I thought I might find some sympathetic comrades here...
I wish you a restful evening, the week is almost done!
I received my order today, but it is the wrong color and the surface is scratched and there are fingerprints on the tabletop.
At the first delivery, the color was exactly as expected.
We are very disappointed!!
What can you offer me?
When we switch tables, will I get a different color or how?
The cancellation email was sent on #DATE#.
In addition, twice.
She was not confirmed.
Many religion teachers do not believe in God and it is just another subject for them like math or geography.
For me, it was always strange, perhaps even because I was raised Christian and I always believed somehow.
How do you stand?
You could also tell stories with your colleagues from work or school with different attitudes.
I understand the difference between private and professional, and it is sensible to separate them.
There is also a curriculum, etc.
It's odd to have a physics teacher who doesn't believe in relativity.
Why would someone want to teach religion if they don't believe in it?
What is culture?
I hope your question is not too personal.
Can it be changed or not? I understand English well.
That is very long, I would stop watching then.
It is good, thank you.
I am expecting a response by the beginning of next week at the latest.
Thank you for your support.
Please help me find films.
Hello people,
I am looking for a movie from my childhood (I am 24).
I believe it was a movie for teenagers.
The film has two time axes (or parallel worlds).
The Modern (Real) World.
On the other hand, the past (or the realm of the dead (uncertain)).
Even though I cannot describe it in greater detail in the real world, there is a young woman.
In the realm of the dead, a young soldier (wearing a uniform similar to those in the movie The Curse of the Caribbean).
From some reason, paths cross and an action is created.
The antagonist is also a soldier from the realm of the dead who wants to bring the woman there in order to be able to live himself. I think.
I believe the transition is also the soldier's grave.
I believe the two soldiers are fighting against each other at the end.
If I say something, I am grateful for any response.
Our baby has only slept on their stomach from Week 1.
Fast forward: lives still.
Relax.
One child holds more than is thought.
Make sure everything is in order, no cuddly animals, go back and check occasionally, but no surveillance.
That makes you crazy!
Fresh air in the room.
Good mattress.
No kisses.
We had no sleeping bag, but always had a blanket.
Watch your child while it sleeps.
Turn your head to the side?
Can something be straightened from the inside?
Is it lying face first in the mattress?
You can check to see if everything is in order.
We have all grown up and when my husband was born, it was a party and everyone laid the kids on their stomachs to sleep.
We are already "regular customers" with you and have already bought many articles.
Why are you offering me only 20EUR?
Hello, I have already written to one of your colleagues and have yet to receive a response.
It is about my closet, which arrived yesterday (order number: #ALPHANUMERIC-ID#).
The right drawer does not fit in the cabinet.
I would like to contact you as soon as possible.
The cabinet is not currently usable.
It is quite clear.
RBTV has promised much.
Yes, I know myself that not everything can be held.
I had a lot of fun with RBTV.
It is simply the case that the politics of this sender have become a mess.
Every format is sponsored (ok), but then still go on a great begging tour.
It was said that one was an "independent" Internet broadcaster.
Arno said he didn't want to be a running advertisement.
What are you doing now?

It applies to everyone, except for Simon and Etienne.
People can obviously continue to insult each other.
Ein Krogmann lacks empathy and is trying to make ash out of the exploded rented rooms.
How can one find this?
If you like, I find it horrible.
I would like to return the defective wooden table that was delivered to me.

Cherry pits are a traditional home remedy for comforting applications, as cherries are able to absorb a lot of heat and release it slowly.
The detachable inner cushion can be easily warmed in the microwave or oven.
The soft touch makes the application especially pleasant, so that the little ones feel safe, even if it does not always go well.
The cherry-stone pillowcase is suitable for the following applications:
Before heating the kitchen, check for unusual odors, stains or burn marks and dispose of them immediately.
Please take the inner cushion out of the package before heating it.
In the microwave up to 300 watts for two minutes (adjustments of the microwave manufacturer).
Immediately after heating, spread the heat evenly in the blanket!
After attaching the inner cushion, return it to its original position.
At the first heating, there may be a slight moisture formation that disappears with repeated applications.
Adhere to the given heating instructions, as longer times or higher energies can lead to damage (ignition and burning risk!).
Check to make sure that heating the kiss in the microwave is allowed according to the instructions of the manufacturer.
After the heated inner cushion was put back in place, please check the temperature of the cushion for suitability for babies (maximum 43 °C) at your elbow joint!
Do not use the pillow during acute and chronic, inflammatory or feverish illnesses, circulatory problems, fresh haematomas, bleeding and open wounds, and in people with diminished pain sensitivity.
Before using this product, please consult a doctor if you have existing skin, heart, vein, diabetes, or tumor conditions, as well as if you are pregnant.
If the seams have opened and loose kernels have come out, dispose of the product and the loose kernels immediately and inaccessible for children.

Is the battery broken?
Yesterday evening, my laptop (ThinkPad E480 20KQ and about 3 years old) stopped being charged by my power supply.
I bought this approximately 5 months ago, so it should still work.
I thought, the power supply alone is enough for operation.
The battery is empty and the laptop won't start even with an inserted network cable.
I expanded the battery, but it still didn't work.
Do you have any ideas?
A new battery has been ordered, but I can't use the laptop online.
Is anything broken?
Thank you for your help!
I want the #PRS_ORG# delivery to be brought to my room.
How can I book it?
I'm interested in the #PRS_ORG# chair.
We don't know how high the seat is.....
Are you still on tour despite all the equipment?
With the Everyday V2 Backpack from Peak Design, there is no problem!
This sentence translates to "20 Liter capacity can also accommodate larger photography equipment without any problems, which can be securely stored using the padded FlexFold dividers."
And whatever everyday items you need, thanks to practical storage solutions in a customizable interior and separable from the photography equipment.
With the "Update" of the Everyday Line to Version 2 (V2), the series is presented in a new look.
Peak Design has developed some highly innovative solutions to protect the interior of the backpack while still allowing quick access to photography gear.
It works in two ways: either conventionally by opening the lid, which can be secured with the MagLatch system, or by a highly thought-out solution that has already proven itself at the Messenger Bags.
There is a metal latch with an accompanying metal bar attached to the front of the rucksack.
Unlike most backpacks, Peak Design has considered multiple "fill levels": there are four stabilizing struts that can be inserted into the closure system.
Is the backpack full, take the top bar if it is heavier, take a lower one if it is lighter.
The catch and the latch are also magnetic.
The backpack can also be securely closed without using the hook.
The second option differentiates the Everyday Backpack from other photo backpacks: in addition to the flap closure, there is also a side-opening zip on both sides of the backpack.
This bag eliminates the biggest drawback of traditional backpacks - you don't have to sift through the contents!
This clever detail greatly enhances the practicality of the backpack: You can not only take your photography equipment, but also everyday items or travel luggage.
You can customize the interior of the backpack and store both items separately - and access them independently through the two side openings.
You can also pull the rucksack from the right side over your body to access the camera equipment in the right main compartment, while everyday items will remain secure in the left rucksack compartment and not interfere.
Easy-to-adjust straps help with that.
The outer shell of the rucksack is made from 100% recycled, weather-resistant nylon, so even when going to Scotland in the fall, the contents will remain dry.
I was waiting for the email from their support.
Yesterday, I received an email confirming the assignment.
The shipping company has announced their intention to contact the customer to arrange the return of the wrongly delivered table.
Until now, I have not received any news.
I would like an immediate settlement.
I am now writing with the third support worker, with none of them I got further than a promise that I would receive an email confirmation.
It is about returning the wrongly delivered Custom #NAME#.
When could the cabinet be delivered?
Keeping it for me is not an option...
It works.
Many thanks for the help.
I wish you a beautiful evening.
Hello, my order number is #NUMBER#. When will the article be delivered?
Order and payment was made on 12.1.21.
I was delivered a completely different lamp than I had ordered.
Please call me.
If you extend the coupon, I will immediately place a larger order, but nevertheless I will keep the damaged furniture piece and not return it.
I could not anticipate how the past year would unfold and was unable to resolve and clarify it in time.
I will not accept the damage as a customer.

Based on the individual technical drawing, a special production program is created that takes into account the characteristics of the original assembly during inspection.
These made-to-order discs ensure high comfort and braking efficiency.
Additional openings increase the efficiency of cooling the disk, while the cuts improve the cleaning of the brake pads and shoes.
The aesthetic features of our tuned wheels emphasize their attractive and striking appearance, which in turn highlights the character of each car.
Coloma is the city where an unexpected event shaped the history of the West Coast.
In 1848, a man discovered shining rocks in the water at the southern bend of the American River.
Although he tried to keep his discovery secret, the news spread quickly and caused the infamous "California Gold Rush" of '49.
Thousands came from near and far and made Coloma one of the fastest growing and flourishing cities in the land.
areas were delineated, tents were pitched, and saloons and hotels appeared almost overnight.
Everyone wanted their share of the wealth of the country.
For many it was said: "Coloma or Bust" (Coloma or Bankruptcy)!
In this game, you are a pioneer who is seeking wealth and fame.
You will be searching for gold, recruiting workers, herding horses, and building companies.
You will have the opportunity to explore the nearby rivers and adjacent areas.
You are not alone - the other pioneers seem to have the same idea!
You must exceed your colleagues to avoid going bankrupt with the rest of them.
Coloma is a fast strategy game with many paths to victory.
You must manage your actions simultaneously while maintaining your resources and constructing a tableau which works more and more for you (so-called "engine building").
The buildings on your tableau allow you to become more efficient, to obtain additional actions or to apply rules in your favor.
With these buildings and dynamic bridge pieces, you can develop your individual playing style by making fine adjustments.
Coloma played over a period of three years from 1848 (the year the gold was discovered), 1849 (the year of the California Gold Rush), to 1850 (the year when California gained official statehood).
A year in Coloma consists of five rounds.
During each round, the players secretly select a location on the game board where they can perform actions simultaneously.
Their selection will be revealed and they will place their pioneers at the appropriate locations.
When a location has the most pioneers, it receives a restriction!
This deactivates one half of the location - thereby reducing the possible actions there.
The players take turns performing actions such as collecting resources, moving wagons, setting up tents, exploring rivers, building bridges, opening shops, and positioning revolver heroes.
When all actions are completed, the pioneers will return.
The spinner rotates at the beginning of each round to a new location, thereby changing the available actions.
This goes on until the challenger has moved five times, thereby uncovering all locations and the year ends.
There is a shootout in which the players Coloma must defend themselves against an attack by enraged bandits.
When the players have recruited enough cowboy heroes and are numerically superior to the bandits, they will receive rewards.
If they fail, they will receive lower rewards or end up in the cemetery.
The game ends after the third shootout, followed by the final scoring.
The player with the most points wins!
I take up to 35 x 25 x 4.5 cm of free shipping, including games.

Why are children not tyrants? Documentary, ARD Mediathek.
Psychological violence, sexual abuse, power abuse.
The ARD Documentation has appeared in my Twitter timeline, and I have already watched it.
Dr. Michael Winterhoff is a popular guest on talk shows and gives lectures across Europe.
His book "Why Our Children Become Tyrants" (2008) sparked a fierce parenting debate.
Former patients and guardians now level serious accusations against him.
Please switch on, the film is hard to bear.
I am very grateful that many people are now thinking and acting differently.
Never, never, never should parents and other authorities have power over the child.
Our goal is to always give the child space for their development and to provide a framework for them that is as large as possible, while still being feasible in the given situation.
I'm still shivering.
Countries are discussing the abolishment of the triple vaccination requirement.
The health ministers of the countries will decide at their next meeting to abolish the national testing requirement for triple vaccinations.
We need clarity as to whether and when the three-fold vaccination requirement can be waived, said Klaus Holetschek (CSU), Chairman of the Health Ministers' Conference, to "Bild am Sonntag".
The loss of 2G plus for triple vaccination is not only medically sensible, but also provides an additional impetus, said Holetschek.
Health Minister Karl Lauterbach (SPD) has promised to present a proposal to the Health Ministers' Conference on the next Tuesday.
I will send the lamp back.
What is the best way to go there?
Hello, I find the #PRS_ORG# chair very beautiful, but I cannot see how high the seat height is.
Can you help me further?
I cannot handle any more shopping.
Error: Oops, something went wrong.
Shopping on the #PRS_ORG# website via computer.
I have updated my contact data.
What is the cause of this?
What you describe is called Awareness, which includes sensory perceptions under general anesthesia.
These occur with a frequency of about 1 in 1000.
It is most common to hear sounds/voices, less often to see images, and most rarely to experience pain.
This topic is relevant to operations involving a high rate of awareness since one must avoid a very deep anesthesia in order to protect the child.
Previous episodes of awareness should be mentioned during the anesthesia consultation.
Specific anesthesia procedures such as total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) come with a slightly increased risk.
This comment from me describes awareness correctly, although it had no definition according to u/Nitemarex.
You have misread the comment.
The chair is broken.
Unfortunately, the 20€ does not help us.
These are legal entitlements.
The bare minimum would be for them to take away the broken chair.
This is in addition to the legal obligation also standard in the eCommerce area.
Please check to see if they can at least take away the broken chair.
We will sell the second chair privately.
We will also lose some money.
I sent you an email that you didn't answer.
Another question.
The order and invoice specify that the goods will be delivered to a room of my choice.
The shipping company is #NAME#.
I just called them.
He told me that they would only deliver to the door - due to #PRS_ORG#.
Is that so?
If I have to, I will have to cancel the order, since I don't know anyone who can help me move the heavy furniture to the first floor.
Why am I not being called?
I had formulated a question.

Rouladen tips and tricks.
I received many great tips last week for the perfect goulash.
There was a feast at Christmas and it was incredibly delicious and buttery!
Thank you again.
I have tasted it and I want to cook a roulade for the first time on New Year's Eve.
I will set up a beef fund tomorrow.
Do you have any other tips for me?
Note: I don't have an oven, I only have a large pot.
What's next?
What happened to the books? How can I get them back on my #PRS_ORG#?
My English is not as good as it used to be, but I'm getting better.
I am requesting a refund of €#NUMBER#.
I was informed by email on January 18th that the refund had been processed.
Until today, my money has not arrived.
Could you please check that?
Where in Lübeck is there still Christmas ham?
For many people, Goose or Duck is associated with Christmas like the Christmas tree and presents.
Have you gotten any chicken yet?
Time is running out.
We will tell you where you can still get a Christmas roast in Lübeck.
The "Drive" of a tube stage contributes significantly to the heat and fatness of the guitar amplifier sound.
This feature is perfectly implemented by the Valve Reactor circuit.
With the VOLUME-, GAIN- and MASTER VOLUME-knobs you can set both the desired level and the distortion of your sound.
The amplifiers in the VT+ series offer a unique POWER LEVEL controller, allowing you to reduce the sound level without affecting the gain or distortion.
It was already sounding like it could be adjusted with the POWER LEVEL knob to access a reserve of power even when it gets really loud.
The Power Level Regulator allows you to utilize the full potential of the VT+ Series in any situation.
The headphones can also be used as a line output.
This signal is processed with a box simulation so that you can get a "acoustic" sound impression even when using headphones or when recording directly.
You can connect a CD or MP3 player to the AUX port so that you can jam to your favorite songs.
A tuner function is also on board - you do not need a separate audio device.
If you spend an additional VFS5 foot pedal, you can also conveniently call sounds per foot, adjust the effect blocks in/out and control the tempo of the compatible effects.
This is essential for live use.
With its new power packages, VOX is taking another step into the future!
I had seen it differently at other places.
Do you have the possibility to send the lamp back?
Is the table too low for you to eat?
I would like to send it back then.
Can you help me further?
What is the dresser?
Will we get another update about the exact delivery date in the next weeks?
Hello, have you ever sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs?
If it doesn't work, I'd be happy with a refund or discount.
Under any circumstances, I will find a buyer for the furniture.
If I don't need more than 1,000 euros worth of goods, then there is still a lot.
I have just received my delivery and would have liked to know if screws were included in the delivery.
I would like to mount the #PRS_ORG# Spiegel (Door) to the designated hinge.

Iran is making progress in negotiations over an atomic agreement.
Negotiations over the revival of the International Atomic Agreement have made progress according to Iranian reports.
Both sides are standing before agreeing on the topics that are on the agenda, said Iran's chief negotiator Ali Bagheri on Sunday to the news agency Irna.
This is a "positive and important development", as there had been no agreement even on the topics to be discussed at first.
The agreement should prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons.
The Vienna talks to revive the agreement were resumed after a week-long break.
Representatives from Iran, Germany, Great Britain, China, France, and Russia are taking part in the negotiations.
A US delegation is also present in Vienna, but only indirectly involved in the negotiations.
Thuringia has overtaken Saxony - it is now a federal state with the highest Corona incidence.
Thuringia has replaced Saxony and currently has the highest incidence rate nationwide.
As the only federal state, the value exceeds the mark of 1000.
Thuringia was the only German state to exceed 1000 cases of Corona infection on Sunday.
The Robert Koch Institute reported 1025 new cases of infection per 100,000 people.
In Saxony, which had always had the highest incidence rate nationwide, it was 990.5 on Sunday.
On Friday and Saturday, the incidence in Thuringia has slightly decreased, but it was still above 1000.
In Thuringia, 2242 new cases of Sars-CoV-2 virus infection and 16 additional deaths related to the infection were reported within a day.
200 people were hospitalized on Sunday with COVID-19.
It is possible that there may be delays in reporting on weekends.
In addition, health authorities have been overwhelmed for weeks and are unable to keep up with the number of new cases.
I understand that.
Due to the delivery beginning in March, it may be possible until then.
I have to print it and stick it on the package and give it to the postman, right?
I don't have to do anything else?
I want to avoid that, so I am writing to you.
I would like to take responsibility for the return shipping.
I consider the 8 euro return fee to be an act of dishonesty.
It is time for changes.
The German Bundestag welcomed me, I am StratorDE in the heart of Europe on a fantastic day!
What is the purpose of this post?
When one looks back at the activities of the past months of the Bundestag, one can conclude that it is not extinct.
We have come to a winter standstill and have widened the summer gap for several months.
Where is the problem?
What happened?
Most likely, this is related to dissatisfaction, as some things have gone wrong and we are generally standing still.
In the last days it has become increasingly clear that many people are still enthusiastic about the upcoming federal election.
What needs to be changed.
This place is asking the community around the Bundestag which one wants to keep alive.
The impetus came from u/edizVEVO, who recently became aware of this project and found a heap of scattered pieces.
Several people have found each other within the community who are eager to rebuild the project.
I also invite everyone to join in, so that this project can continue to exist in the future.
We have created a discussion platform in the form of a Discord server, where we can exchange ideas and work on concrete things together.
You can join the server by clicking on this link.
Goals.
How will the Bundestag function in the future?
Which existing orders must be changed / adapted / removed?
How should we present ourselves to the outside world in the future?
How should new members be recruited?
How do we create a fair voting system?
I'm pretty sure I've forgotten a few things, but it's not too bad. We'll be able to discuss it on Discord at the end.
If you have the desire and time, come to the Discord, work with us, and let's decide the future democratically.
I have ordered a lamp shade that will be delivered.
I can see that the article is too big for my taste.
I have already ordered another hanging for you.
I put it together and noticed it then when I took the soft foam.
Very sad about that.
I hope to receive a full refund and that this is returned.
This is quite sad, as the #NAME# is much darker than expected.
I still have a question: is the day roof #PRS_ORG# available in large sizes, for example 240/240?
#PRS_ORG# must be able to guarantee that the faulty cabinet will be removed promptly.
Please do it now.
I have not found an appropriate packaging, but I will try to take the shelf apart as far as possible for the pickup - #PRS_ORG# needs to clarify how this can work.
#PRS_ORG# can contact me anytime by phone to arrange a pickup time.
Is there an instruction manual for assembly?
How long would it take to get these and decide whether to return them?
Why are you vegan?
I had a conversation with a colleague that I like.
She used to live vegetarian for a while, but now eats meat only occasionally.
I was also a vegetarian for several years.
When asked if I always wanted to be vegan and vegetarianism was a planned intermediate step, I answered honestly without hesitation.
I used to think that I was supporting animal welfare by being a vegetarian, but eventually I realized that I was actually supporting animal cruelty by doing so.
My decision to become vegan.
At that moment I had the impression that she was feeling ill-disposed, she then defended vegetarianism and said she knew where her meat came from and that vegetarians could reduce animal suffering.
I asked myself if my response was correct.
How do you answer the question?
I feel like vegans are often put in a corner and conflicts arise without them wanting it.
A vegan-loving hippie greets you.
It is not an exception under § 312d of the German Civil Code.
Your #PRS_ORG# is not exempt from the legal requirements for distance selling.
I will not be able to pick up my retoure at the assigned date.
Unfortunately, I cannot be there for the funeral as I am unable to change that.
Could you please assign me an alternative pickup time.
I will be present from 01.02.#NUMBER# onwards.
The local government has provided 45,000 euros in funding for water rescue equipment.
The Rhineland-Palatinate Internal Minister Roger Lewentz recently presented a grant of 45,000 euros to Lahnstein's mayor Peter Labonte for a new rescue vehicle for the volunteer fire department.
The total costs of the vehicle, which has been in use since November 20
A good and important investment in security.
I am delighted that Rhineland-Palatinate is supporting us here, says Lahnstein's mayor Peter Labonte.
The diving equipment is used by the Lahnstein Diving Team, one of seven units in Rhineland-Palatinate.
They fulfill tasks in water and ice rescue, as well as technical assistance.
People in Lahnstein constantly calculate with increasing investments: The boom of hotel shipping on Rhine and Mosel, as well as the increasing use of Lahn as a leisure river, contribute to this.
I bought a book that I could only read for 10%, and then the problems began.
I cannot open the book.
Following their recommendations, I synchronized, removed and reloaded the app, but it didn't work.
I am frustrated because this whole process has taken a lot of time and I hope for help now.
Okay, that's it.
I would like to order 3 articles from the #PRS_ORG# collection in June.
Can I enter a date in the ordering process?
According to the ANSI/PLATO FL1 Standard, the previously mentioned values are determined at 21°C±3°C, 50%-80% humidity and the embedded 275mAh LiPo battery.
The values may vary depending on the type of lamp used, the age and environment.
The brightness level in the stage of Hell contains the brightness with reduced intensity due to the overheating protection.

Thank you for taking the time to do this, I have also spent almost a decade in a similar job, speaking we were both bodyguards in the executive, I don't want to go into further details!
I always find the question of rights and lefts simplified.
Generally, one should say that the civil servant is more likely to come from the liberal to conservative spectrum and not from the revolutionary left, which should be clear to everyone.
It should be clear to everyone that these people, who are attracted to the magical right-wing ideology, will have difficulty dealing with the lived reality, since you now have many Germans with a migrant background, women, and also homosexuals (and I don't mean the exaggeratedly feminine stereotypical gay people, but rather normal men and women who you wouldn't notice if they didn't tell you). I can rely on these people to save your life or set this for you.
Even these fringe groups are represented, even though it may sound comical to my experience, they are proud to be German and feel they are being mistreated by overly-zealous left-wing policies, even though these policies are supposedly meant to help them. They just want to be treated normally.
Going back to the right, of course, police and military are also a cross-section of society, so you can find extreme right there, which however openly express their opinion or even make any state-threatening plans media overly exaggerated and annoys me.
It is not uncommon for police officers and soldiers who have had negative experiences abroad to begin to stereotype and say things that are controversial or politically incorrect.
It is possible to meet like-minded people who engage in lively discussions.
Despite that, it will be combatted successfully and countered by political education and enlightenment!
Germany is so internationally entwined and I think that's a good thing in my opinion that we couldn't afford to have real racists and Nazis in our ranks!
I don't understand it, but I have ordered it on the German side too.
Why should this come from England?
When I ordered, it was sold out.
I had already ordered in November.
It was confirmed to me in your confirmation of the order.
It is still about my order, which is no longer available.
I have chatted with #NAME# before.
Alternatively, one could still deliver the other #PRS_ORG# basket for #NUMBER# euros to Germany or is it available somewhere in Germany.
I always find your company as my partner.
At the top of the wooden part there are two deep grooves, which were filled with something yellow.
There is a small scratch on the mirror itself.
Is the child orderly?
Hello, I have been busy with something for a long time.
I am very disciplined and organized, (independent, with little free time), but throughout my life I have gotten more used to messing up my housekeeping than getting it right.
There are times when nothing happens and then suddenly I get motivated and start cleaning and organizing.
In reality, no one could just drop by spontaneously.
My husband is (unfortunately) not better, it bothers me somewhere but I usually lose against work and apathy.
The kitchen is cleaned most regularly since we like to cook.
Have you been able to become more orderly with your children?
We haven't done anything yet, but this question has been bothering me for a while.
For me, it doesn't bother me that there is no one visiting, as long as there is fresh clothing available and the kitchen is usable.
Do you give your child a bigger push or do you remain sloppy?
I am looking forward to your response.

Can I pursue a career in social work - as someone with a vulnerable personality disorder?
I have completed an education in the field of software development and have been learning for about one year.
Unfortunately, I am realizing more and more that this job is not right for me, which is why I have been contemplating starting afresh and studying social work.
I have a fearful (or avoidant) personality disorder (FPD).
In essence, it means that I lack self-esteem and am consequently shy.
I have no problem talking on a professional level, but it is difficult for me to have casual conversations and I have been told that I have become better at it.
Can I become a social worker?
I would rather not work as a street worker or in a youth hangout but rather in examples such as substance abuse counseling or family support.
I know but I'm not sure if the concrete everyday life is really like I imagine it to be, and it is difficult to find something about it on the internet.
The ÄVPS leads to problems in my job (for me, emotionally), because it always brings me down when something is wrong with my code ("just simple things messed up") and I have to ask more experienced colleagues for help ("I should already know how to do it"/"I have to deal with my dumb questions"/"he has to hold me back").
I will likely have problems in every job, but I wanted to mention it here.
Did you get the sofa back?
There was no confirmation for that.
I am waiting for a pickup time.
Could you please give me back what I asked for?
When I have downloaded a book from the #PRS_ORG#, the message indicates that the #PRS_ORG# has not authorized this book.
Are there any problems?
I was chatting with #PRS_ORG#, who asked me if I had received a delivery confirmation for my dresser.
The protein taken in with the food is broken down in the bird's digestive tract into individual amino acids. These amino acids are then used to build the bird's own protein molecules, which it needs for feather formation.
The feather formation in the nestling and the feather regrowth in the moulting bird are extremely complex processes and involve a high demand for the entire organism.
Note that NEKTON-Bio should not be administered during breeding, as it can cause disruptions to the reproductive cycle.
Following the usual gift of NEKTON-Bio, the daily vitamin supplement with NEKTON-S (Multivitamin) and NEKTON-MSA (Mineral Supplement) should be continued.

One NEKTON-Bio tablet should be dissolved in 250 ml of water or 100 grams of soft food.
It is recommended to only prepare as much drinking water/feed as the bird consumes daily and to change the water/feed daily.
A stricken measuring spoon (inclusive) corresponds to 1 NEKTON Bio.
At strong feather damage, a double or triple dose of Nekton Bio can be given until feather regrowth is visible.
Until the new feather growth is complete, the normal dose will be given.
NEKTON-Bio should be stored dry, without direct sunlight, between 15° and 25°C.
Excuse me, but the chair is being sold as a office chair.
How can a swivel chair break down after 9 months?
The warranty rights in Germany are 24 months.
This is really terrible service.
Hello, I sent an email on Monday to let you know that my order arrived damaged and with attached pictures.
Did you receive this email?
Statement of a community worker in contradiction to the regulation.
Hello, I am looking for legal advice in German.
I have the following problem.
A walnut tree will be felled on our property.
Application to the municipality submitted.
A worker has written to me saying that pruning fruit trees and thus also gathering walnuts is not part of the regulation.
The walnut is specifically mentioned in the regulation as a protective tree.
Can I now leave the employee's statement or not?
On one side, I can rely on expert opinion.
On the other hand, the regulation is clear.
Thank you for your answers.
We understand that.
We will use the new packaging for that.
I have not received any message.
Nevertheless, I still have a sofa without using it.
Could you offer me a discount or inheritance?
What was expensive?
I believe, only the question is, whether I can pay in Euros and have the roof delivered to Germany.
Can you check this?
A serious traffic accident occurred in Selb.
Yesterday, there was a serious traffic accident on the St 2179 between the Anschlussstelle Selb-Nord and Plößberg.
The police siren is currently reporting that a car has crossed over into the oncoming lane (14:03 pm).
There are injured people.
I understand.
Thank you again for making it so easy!
Rat and ideas for further career life.
Happy Christmas to you!
My Christmas is not very good, because my head is busy thinking about everything I can think of.
Before I continue here now: I need advice and the best from people who somehow know my situation - from you.
I'm just starting out as a referee.
I originally studied something else and worked in that area (to at least some extent, I will not be more specific here).
It was boring for me and I was looking for alternatives that would be more fun.
At some point I had landed in the teaching profession and I was sure of it, even though the working conditions were much less flexible than in my previous job, but I didn't care.
I have arrived at the third "I am searching for other job postings"
It has been half a year.
Before that I always decided to keep going and at least finish the race, afterwards I can still change my mind.
I am done.
I had so little free time last month that I was completely drained.
Even though it is vacation time, there is still work that awaits me.
Before each exam, I always thought I was stress-resistant, but it was my weekend also my weekend and my celebration my celebration.
I had freedom.
The stress was equal in the moments.
I am overwhelmed by the family celebration.
Then there are these rigid structures that further annoy me.
In general, it's enjoyable and from the outside, it runs smoothly in terms of feedback and so on.
I am completely drained and I am wondering how much stress my body can take before it shuts down completely - if it hasn't already.
I'm asking myself if I want to keep working like this for the rest of my life - especially when I read some of your contributions -, or if I should rather go back to the old area where I was appreciated, was given free time when I needed it, and found the work boring but was still paid adequately and was part of a team that worked together and not as an individual fighter like nowadays.
Then I wonder if I won't be back at the same place next year and be dissatisfied.
You may notice that it is all a bit confusing, but as outsiders, you may have advice or ideas on how I can get out of this situation, where I am on the verge of crying at the smallest thought.
I am not making any decisions now due to the strong emotions I am feeling, which is likely to lead to nothing good.
Perhaps your views can help me to at least see a little bit of light at the end of the tunnel - or to be able to enjoy Christmas, which would be enough for now.
Thank you for reading and forgiving the whiny tone from me.
I hope, at least, my situation has become a little clearer.
Since its introduction in 2001, the Valvetronix series from VOX has been continuously developed, which includes the combination of advanced modeling technology with the "Valve Reactor" circuit, which perfectly replicates the behavior of a tube amplifier.
With the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X Amps, we present a brand new Modeling Engine that is state-of-the-art in terms of sound.
Thanks to Virtual Element Technology (VET), which is based on the analysis of components and circuitry, the VTX amplifiers offer an authenticity that is absolutely impressive.
This amplifier includes the self-evident three-stage Valvetronix power amplifier.
This relies in part on actual analog circuits, as these can capture the sound variations and nuances of a tube amplifier better than any simulation.
In addition to this complicated switching, the VTX amplifiers offer a closed case and a bass-reflex system, from which natural resonances only spurt.
With the "Tone Room" software from VOX, you can even adjust and manipulate historical facts on the virtual level until the sound is exactly how you always imagined it.
The perfect combination of tube sound with modeling technology is primarily due to the 2001 introduced VOX Valve Reactor technology.
Self-evidently, it has been refined multiple times in order to meet new sound requirements, which in 2010 led to a performance boost of the VOX Valvetronix series - with more dynamics as well as numerous and decisive improved amplifier models.
From the VT20+ to the VT120+ with two speakers, the new Valvetronix series was designed so that guitarists can find maximum sound variety.
All guitarists dream of the pressure and dynamics of a tube amplifier: they expect a fat sound, a nuanced response to playing dynamics and string attack, as well as prompt response.
During an in-depth analysis, the VOX engineers discovered that the final stage primarily determines the tube character of the amplifier and based on this finding, they developed the VOX Valve Reactor Technology.
A 12AX7 tube-loaded Valve Reactor Schematic of every VT+ amplifier perfectly captures the subtle nuances and sound character of a tube amplifier.
Despite 20 points from Wagner, the Magic lost to the Clippers.
The Orlando Magic's losing streak in the NBA continues.
The Wagner brothers can shine - it's not enough to defeat the Los Angeles Clippers.
Despite 20 points from Franz Wagner and seven from his older brother Moritz, the Magic lost to the Los Angeles Clippers 104:106 on Saturday.
The main section is also adjustable: with three individually placeable and foldable Klettverschluss parts, it is suitable for any kind of cameras - from mirrorless system cameras of all sizes up to full-frame reflex cameras.
What finally fits in the backpack depends on the size of the camera and the lenses.
A possible kit configuration would be a DSLR camera with an attached lens, two or three interchangeable lenses, and a pop-up flash.
Larger DSLM cameras such as those in the Sony A7 series or the Fuji X-T2 allow for additional lenses.
In addition, one can store a lot of accessories.
Anyone who has a small DSLM camera (Olympus MFT, Fujifilm X-A or E-series) can use the backpack for their equipment and photography-related items.
Drones pilots can find an optimal choice with the Everyday Backpack 20L, as it offers enough space for a DJI Mavic Pro including remote control and accessories.
Volcanic eruption on La Palma: longest in history
In the three months since the eruption began, the lava flows on the Canary Island have caused considerable damage.
Is the end in sight?
Since Sunday, the volcanic eruption on La Palma has been the longest in its known history, lasting for 85 days.
In 1585, the eruption of the volcano Tehuya lasted 84 days, making it the longest on the Atlantic island off the west coast of Africa.
No reliable data is available for past eruptions.
The activity of the unnamed volcano on the Cumbre Vieja has decreased in recent days, but volcanologists are still hesitant to make any predictions as to when it might end.
The indicators point to a slowdown.
The best news is that they are stable, said President Mariano Hernández Zapata of the island council to the state broadcaster RTVE.
The damage is in the millions.
Since the beginning of the eruption, over 1000 degrees hot lava has destroyed more than 2900 homes and other buildings, as reported by RTVE.
1200 hectares were covered by a meter-thick lava layer.
That is almost 1700 football fields.
More than 7000 people had to be evacuated, and the estimated damages are over 900 million euros.
Two new landmasses, each about 50 hectares in size, were created by the freezing of lava along the coast.
The important banana cultivation, on which about half of the 85,000 inhabitants of the island depend either directly or indirectly, was particularly hard hit by the crisis.
The newspaper "El País" reported that 225 hectares of banana plantations were destroyed, and other areas were heavily impacted.
Christmas and presents.
Christmas is at the door and the children can hardly wait for the heavenly festival.
The many colorful gifts under the Christmas tree have combined with the spiritual atmosphere and the crackling tension to make it alluring.
Christmas is one of the few traditional occasions that can still bring our increasingly divided society together.
It is important to be aware of the Christmas tradition of giving, so that the act of giving, which according to the French sociologist and ethnologist Marcel Mauss was a peace-bringing "social contract of nature-peoples", can be renewed and infused with life.
How Nicholas became the Christ Child.
The Protestants were particularly strict about associating Christmas with gift-giving.
On St. Nicholas Day, gifts of various kinds were exchanged.
The background of this popular custom is that Saint Nicholas as Bishop of Myra secretly threw three women a bag of gold through their window to save them from a life of sin.
From this unconventional way of giving originated the popular custom in Germany of filling children's shoes with gifts.
Protestants objected to this practice because they reject intermediaries between God and humans as "idolatry".
From these reasons, they defend themselves against the institution.
Martin Luther created Father Christmas and established a new tradition with it.
The focus of the gift-giving shifted to Christmas Eve.
Most Protestants no longer view such detail questions with such scrutiny, which only angers a few anymore that the tradition of Saint Nicholas, similar to the custom of Saint Martin with its singing and procession, still remains a firm part of the Christmas season.
Today, one can find shoes by the door and under the Christmas tree from socks to highly desired watches, whatever the heart desires.
Diversity of Traditions in Christian Countries
Sources attest a tradition of giving since the 13th century on St. Nicholas' Day.
With the Reformation, the giving of gifts was moved to Christmas Eve.
In Christian-influenced countries, there is a joyful hubbub over who brings the gifts to the children.
In Germany, it depends on the region whether Santa Claus or Father Christmas appears on Christmas Eve, who has acquired certain characteristics over time.
For example, his white drunken beard, which has little in common with the more strict Assyrian beard of the historical figure, his sleigh, which is pulled by reindeer, and the preference for the chimney in order to gain access to the houses.
In the Netherlands, Saint Nicholas remains the central figure at Christmas.
In Spain, the Three Kings bring gifts, while in Italy, the witch Befana is said to have shown them the way to the Jesus child.
In Scandinavia, sometimes mythical creatures bring gifts, while in Russia, Father Frost brought some fame.
There are three horses, not reindeer, pulling the sleigh.
In Czechia, the motherland of the Reformation during the Hussite Wars, the Christkind is responsible for delivering the gifts.
I have been trying for three weeks to download a new book, but I keep getting this error message: My account and contact details are currently invalid.
Please help to fix the mistake, as I don't know how to do it.
Otherwise, buy another e-book from #PRS_ORG#.
I have been searching for a return label #NUMBER# for my order this past week and this morning.
I was told that something will be sent to me.
I haven't received any yet (even in the SPAM folder), so I was just wondering how long this usually takes.
Many thanks.
The police shot a suspected bank robber near the King's Palace.
Near the Kensington Palace in London, a police officer shot a man armed with a weapon on Saturday.
The police informed that a man had been reported to have gone into a bank and a bookmaker's shop with a weapon.
The man fled according to the authorities in a vehicle that was later stopped by officers.
It sounded like shots were fired and the man was hit.
He was declared dead at the scene.
The police did not assume a terrorist motive.
The area around the Kensington Palace is home to several embassies.
The Palace is the official residence of Prince William, his wife Catherine, and their three children.
More members of the royal family live there.

The maximum duration of a flight is 10 hours.
The robust plastic version is suitable for outdoor use throughout the year.
At the Hollywood spectacle, it is usually dangerous objects from distant galaxies that glow brightly within.
Smart Stone is a fascinating solar light - either in white or colored light (in six different tones).
The amorphous, shapeless design is deliberately chosen: This modern light object presents itself to the public like a naturally shaped large pebble during the day.
Its organic curves fit into any natural environment - whether by the terrace, in the lawn or in the flowerbed.
He is also able to prevail in the neighborhood of larger pebbles and boulders, thanks to his size.
You can save time by doing preliminary work: 'Smart Stone' requires neither an electrical connection nor batteries.
Place the "Light Stone" at any sunny spot you choose.
Two provided poles provide stability as needed.
The white plastic shell is robust and weatherproof.
The Solarmodule hides »Smart Stone« discreetly within its interior, along with its battery and two LEDs - one for white, the other for colored light.
The battery is charging when sunlight falls on the housing.
As the sun sets, "Smart Stone" begins to glow; you can choose from six attractive light colors – in addition to Daylight White – to suit your preference.
The shutdown occurs eventually when the battery level reaches a preset minimum or it becomes bright again.
As soon as the sun appears, the laundry cycle will start from the beginning the next day.

The sentence "Pillenproblem" translates to "Pill Problem" in English.
Hello lovely people,
I hope I am doing everything correctly, it is actually my first post after a year.
To my problem: I started taking the pill about five years ago, primarily because I was experiencing unbearable pain during my period and terrible PMS symptoms before my period.
I would like to stay because I already have to take too many medications that I cannot choose for myself.
My main problem, surprisingly, not the pain, but my skin.
I got a two-year break from 0 to 100 explosive pimples and these everywhere.
It was so superficial, but it really bothered me and I didn't feel well.
In the two years' pause, it never really normalized.
Someone might have some tips to avoid this situation in the future.
My cosmetics are fragrance-free and hassle-free, but perhaps someone can recommend something for me.
The female doctor didn't take me seriously and a dermatologist appointment is still pending.
Thank you to everyone who has read the novel!
Love is such a strange thing.
If you have severe neurodermatitis, take some time to rest, and the knotty flakes and acne will eventually go away.
I have tried various diets due to my Christian faith and have remained on a sugar, milk and meat-free diet, as nothing else has worked properly.
It could be that there's a worm in the system, but if I want to be everywhere, I'd rather not look for anything else that's wrong.
I had already given my colleague the seminar paper.
I have lost the conversation and don't know what was replied to my request.
I was in the middle of working and answering the phone, and suddenly everything was gone...
If the money had been there, I would have seen it.
Please check my bank data, maybe something was wrong.

In the name of the people: lay judges render verdicts.
In the courtroom, they sit in everyday clothing on the judge's bench.
A lot depends on their verdict, even if they are not wearing a robe: Judges decide with professional judges how long someone should go to jail.
Sascha Wickert from Boos and Ruth Ertz from Bad Kreuznach are two of the 125 lay judges at the John F. Kennedy Street Court in Bad Kreuznach.
Hello, unfortunately I am not able to access the customer account.
Could you please send the invoice from Order #NUMBER# to the above-mentioned email address?
Can we dispose of the packaging material?
We have no means of preserving these for so long.
We would use the table as if it were theirs, as if it were ours.
He had already ordered the same chair in blue in November and received it. Therefore, because they are so beautiful, he now has one in gray.
The dresser must be completely disassembled for pickup and return.
When would the pickup be?
A new 110-kV power cable will be built in 2022.
The approval for the relocation of the new high-voltage cable at Tann is valid.
The government of Bavaria has decided to clear the way for construction to begin in 2022.
Bayernwerk shared the news now.
The seven-kilometer-long earth cable will connect the Tann substation in the north of the village and the existing 110-kilovolt line between Simbach and Pfarrkirchen.
The cable will be connected near the town of Edermanning at a pole of the power line.
Good Morning.
My order from 03.01.21 with order number #NUMBER# has arrived in parts.
The blue package with send number #NUMBER# was returned by #PRS_ORG# with the note "Delivery not possible".
The other three packages have arrived, so delivery is now possible.
Can you tell me what happens next?
Have a great start to the week!
You can forget it, I have already explained it to you several times.
This is a glass cabinet and all the sides are shattered, so there is glass everywhere and the cardboard is broken.
My dresser is in my apartment and #PRS_ORG# is refusing to come into the apartment due to the #PRS_ORG# regulations.
This means that the dresser cannot be taken away because no one is allowed to enter my apartment.
Thank you for the message.
Why only 20 euros?
The original price of this chair was #NUMBER# EUR.
No, it is with all books, therefore the inquiry at #PRS_ORG#, since it seems to be a general problem.
Planning a lesson (EK)
Hello dear colleagues,
I have been enjoying teaching this summer, but I currently have difficulty planning my lessons in Earth Science in an efficient manner.
Unfortunately, my school is not well equipped technically, so I can only use a table, a textbook, and a projector as tools.
At school I can also copy s/w for free (which geography annoys).
I need to spend a lot of time now to plan my hours.
We are currently discussing geographic factors and I am supposed to answer every hour.
In essence, the methods repeat themselves, but on the other hand, I don't want to invest too much time in simple teaching hours (I need it for UBs etc.).
I always start planning from the learning goal (what do I want to achieve) and then I think about how I can build it (usually I create an outline with texts from books that my school doesn't have).
We have the book Terra and with most of the tasks in the book I am not satisfied.
These are the worksheets.
Maybe someone can teach me how to work efficiently with the book.
I would really enjoy that.
I would like to return the #PRS_ORG# from the order #NUMBER#.
I have already decided to join a new organization #PRS_ORG#, but I would like to wrap up the retreat as soon as possible.
The retail industry is concerned about the 2G rule during the Christmas season.
In most businesses, only those who are vaccinated or recovered are allowed.
The trade considers it unnecessary and complains about mistakes.
He has also prepared an alternative solution.
According to the HDE, the 2G regulations will damage the important Christmas business of the retail sector.
Complaints have been made about shortages of non-daily items, criticized HDE Managing Director Stefan Genth.
According to a recent survey of 1100 traders, more than 70% of them were pessimistic about the remaining days of the year.
Many had already written their Christmas shopping list.
What was supposed to be the highlight of the year, said Genth, is now often a hole with no ground.
Retailers with 2G access restrictions lost approximately one-third of their pre-crisis sales last week.
Sales only occur in the retail sector as well as online.
The union demanded consequences from the dramatic development.
The purchase of masks, distance, and hygiene concept is a secure matter, said the managing director.
Going shopping brings us no further in the fight against the pandemic, he emphasized.
The current regulations frightened customers and required a high level of personnel resources.
He called for the federal government to approve the ban on smoking in public places, nationwide.
Each customer must be checked only once on 2G (vaccinated or cured) and be given a band on that day to access all shops.
In addition, in the retail sector - as is already the case in public transportation with the 3G rule (vaccinated, recovered or tested) - spot checks should be sufficient.
The specialized real estate company Deutsche Euroshop spoke of a difficult Christmas business.
The frequencies were last around 75 percent of the pre-COVID-19 level, with sales around 90 percent.
These numbers will now fall right in the middle of the important Christmas shopping, said CEO Wilhelm Wellner of "Wirtschaftswoche".
Due to the high personnel and administrative effort, it will be attempted to find solutions and to obtain approval.
This is the so-called "bracelet solution", where visitors can present their 2G proof at a central location in the center and then, equipped with a wristband similar to those found in a club hotel, be allowed to freely enter all shops.
I recently ordered and received the #PRS_ORG#.
The Spiegel has a scratch and the frame is also incorrect, which was attempted to be covered up with a yellow stuffing.
It looks bad.
I would like to give back the mirror and have already put it back in the package and taped it up.
What should I do now for the return?
The lamp is designed based on new, flat SMD LEDs with high power and high color reproduction.
For the setting of the color temperature and brightness of the lamp, a modern microprocessor with extraordinary capabilities is responsible.
Besides adjusting the brightness, there are two standard color temperatures: daylight and artificial light.
It is possible to manually set and save the color temperature in the range of 3100 to 5650K.
You can use the current settings in the Flash storage.
The special feature of the controller is that it is easy and intuitive to use.
The lightbulb produces a lot of light with a soft, high-quality light, completely flicker-free.
The beam angle of 120 degrees, which allows you to illuminate large areas with a small distance is excellent.
Even in reporter situations in small rooms or short distances.
You can adjust the brightness without changing the color temperature.
It is a great tool for working both on a film set or in a studio.
The DMX512 -Controller enables the remote control of the light in television studios or when the light is installed in hard-to-reach places.
The control panel is on the back of the light, consisting of buttons and a lit display.
The display shows the current brightness setting in percent and the current color temperature in Kelvin.
There is a slot for the NP-F Akkus (not included in the delivery).
The storage has three panel settings for brightness and color temperature.
To set the individual settings on the storage locations, simply pressing a storage button for a longer period will accomplish the task.
The storage controller stores the current state of the lamp when it is turned off so that when it is turned back on, the known situation is restored - very practical for studio work when, for example, the camera is set to certain color temperatures.
The greatest strength of the DL3120 Functionality comes from its ability to operate with economical NP-F batteries.
These are often already owned by photographers and cameramen (and women) - so you can access existing equipment.
The DL3120 can also check if the batteries have enough power - it is equipped with a battery tester - for each of the two battery compartments, with the left battery's upper display and the right one on the lower display.
In addition, it is naturally possible to continuously supply power to the headlights via the included power supply.
The construction of the flashlight is very simple.
You have a 16mm hose attachment to secure it, so you can connect it directly to your camera.
The inclination can be reliably established by measuring both sides.
It was considered that the mechanical components should be of the highest quality and therefore be designed for longevity and hard use.
Additionally, there is a joint included in the delivery.
The delivery also includes a bag.
You can transport or store the light and its accessories, if you want to buy them, without any problems.
I'm sorry, I got the gift and it's too small.
We wanted to throw a party after Frankfurt's remarkable comeback against Leverkusen.
What an amazing reaction from Eintracht Frankfurt.
After 22 minutes, it seemed that the previously winless Hessen were on their way to their second consecutive Bundesliga defeat.
Then the SGE turned around, vented their frustration from a mediocre season start in a matter of hours and won furiously 5:2. "It's insane what the boys have done today", cheered coach Oliver Glasner at DAZN and praised each individual player, saying "general praise for everyone who was involved".
At first, it seemed like there would be another dampener for the now ninth-placed Frankfurt team, still behind their expectations.
Patrik Schick had led Leverkusen to a 2-0 lead.
What happened also impressed the SGE coach.
The players then returned and showed a fantastic performance, according to Glasner.
I am ecstatic with the performance we have shown and, of course, with the result.
Defender Christopher Lenz, who had not been able to play since the fourth game due to a muscle injury, emphasized the morale of his teammates.
He said, "I believe our mentality is incredible," and he was especially delighted with the result, not only for the participants, but also for the viewers.
That was the party we wanted to throw.
Glasner will now focus on the upcoming tasks, but he is also in a good position regarding the personnel situation.
It is remarkable that we all players are in top shape in December, that all players are physically fit.
Our medical department is top-notch, but the players also live and work professionally.
He/She wants to proceed step by step and remain humble, and to complete the tasks by the end of the year at this level.
Next up is a away game at Borussia Mönchengladbach on Wednesday (8:30 pm, Sky).
I will send you the package due to my own mistake.
I have tried to call #PRS_ORG# and get them to redirect me, but there was no chance.
Can the order be resent to me or do I have to wait until the money is refunded and then place the order again?
I wouldn't order it again because it has already taken too long.
Have you ever sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs?
Dampers for the women's handball team before the quarterfinals against Spain.
Germany's women's handball team slunk away with their heads hung low and empty stares from the court after being defeated by Denmark.
At the conclusion of the World Cup main round, the DHB selection was defeated by 16:32 (8:13) in front of 800 spectators in Granollers and must now face host Spain in the quarterfinals.
We were too afraid and had too much respect for the opponent, according to Bundestrainer Henk Groener.
We must approach Spain differently.
After their first tournament defeat, Germany concluded the Group III main round with 8 points, finishing second behind the Danes (10:0).
It's a shame we couldn't take the flow with us.
Captain Emily Bölk said that it was a bad game that we had to delete.
In order to reach the semifinals, there must be a significant improvement against the 2019 World Cup runner-up on Tuesday to keep the dream of a first medal since 2007 alive.
The best German thrower in the duel with three-time Olympic champion Denmark was back-rower Alina Grijseels, who scored six goals.
We were not there - neither attacking nor defending, midfielder Xenia Smits said and urged us to look ahead quickly.
From the front to the back, not on the level.
Unlike in the previous five tournament games, the German team was not at its peak at the start of the game.
Mistakes and technical errors in the attack and gaps in the defense were responsible for a quick 0:4 deficit after just seven minutes.
Only Dinah Eckerle, the Torfrau, was able to prevent further damage with some of her parades.
The DHB team scored a goal nine minutes and thirty seconds into the game, after Grijseels finished a successful counterattack.
The expected ignition was not this one.
The German women were unable to counter the aggressive blocking of the Danish players - and when they did manage to get into the game, they usually failed against the strong Althea Reinhardt at the net of the Scandinavian players.
The game had ended with a score of 3:10 after 20 minutes, with midfielder Mia Zschocke seeing a red card shortly afterwards due to a hard foul on her opponent.
She can participate again in the quarterfinals.
In the closing stages of the first half, the DHB selection started to improve and, at least, managed to get to five goals.
There was already faint hope for a comeback seven minutes into the game at 9:19.
The Green-Shield bugs committed sins in all areas and made it easy for the well-prepared opponent, who is a contender for a medal at the end.
As a result, the German team was unable to improve their performance and clearly lost the match.

In the context of the Reddit Advent Calendar, we have acquired Nikolaus Day and use it as an opportunity to celebrate family traditions during the Christmas season, including Nikolaus, Christmas Eve, and the Christmas holidays.
What was it like at home then?
How is your partner?
Would you also like to pass on your traditions to your children?
What is the most beautiful for the children?
What are you doing?
Cookie jar.
Grooming.
Are you playing music?
Is the Christmas Man, the Christ Child, or is the gift from Grandma and Grandpa?
Whatever works for you, everyone puts in the effort and puts in extra effort around Christmas to make it as beautiful as possible as a family.
Are there any firm traditions, or even something different every year: tell us how it went in your family!
Could you please provide me with a transaction number or anything else that could help?
Confirmation of Transfer... etc
I would like to give a coupon code.
As with #PRS_ORG# gift vouchers
What is going on there?
The title is "I am involved in mobile immunization teams, where (so far) only the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine is administered in nursing homes.
Once most of it is done, it will go to vaccination centers for me.
I am happy to answer questions without a time limit regarding organizational and human aspects, as well as medical questions, so long as they are not personal (e.g. "I take medication X, will the vaccine interact with it?").
In my area, I am responsible for educating people about vaccination, determining eligibility (person has the right to be vaccinated according to the CoronaVaccination Ordinance and no reasons to oppose it), medical documentation, and providing emergency care in case of allergic reactions (never happened to me).
The administration of the vaccine can be delegated to qualified personnel, such as medical assistants.
We often do not have pharmaceutical assistants for vaccine preparation, who can not perform injections, so I had to do most of the injections myself.
Difficult "Skin" Question: Amberger knows the solution.
What is a "Huidlerer"?
This dialect word, sent from Amberg, has caused viewers of the BR television show "Wir in Bayern" to ponder deeply.
However, this time the term remained unrecognized by the callers, unlike previous days.
No, it was not a "man who was nervous".
Nobody has to hurry.
People heard from the TV moderator that it was completely false.
The man from Amberg revealed the solution and thus caused much astonishment among many people in the Upper Palatinate.
The audience learned that the Huidlerer is a rag, which someone uses to wipe the oven.
Antony Rowley, a dialect expert from Bavarian television who has been frequently asked by for years, confirmed this.
With the remark that this is a typical Upper Palatine concept, derived somehow from the more familiar dialect word "Houden".
With which education gap was closed - even for many who have been living in Amberg for a long time.
I haven't been able to buy books for the last two weeks.
After confirmation, there is always a following error message: oops - something went wrong - try again later.
I have restarted the #PRS_ORG#, connected the PC, synchronized and repaired it.
Nothing has helped.
Do wheels on a bike really provide enough protection against punctures?
I woke up this morning full of enthusiasm to start training for my bike tour next week, at least to some extent.
I said, I did it and I rode my new racing bike, which I bought yesterday on eBay.
The first 40 km were really beautiful - but then that happened, which is always lurking in the inner city (this time: Thank you Krefeld!).
Glassbreaker on the track.
Zack, my rear wheels didn't want to participate in the rest of the journey anymore.
Given that I didn't have the chance to get a replacement jacket and hose, I had to be content with a less than satisfactory attitude and take the first available train back home.
It is not as bad as it could be, perhaps it is even better to practice the bike maintenance before the ride.
Now I stand before a question and hope that you can help me.
If I have to walk a long distance over several days, I would really hate to keep running into this problem.
It was not too bad, since the old tires from the previous owner (a very nice old man, who had given me the bike until 14:00 and had already described them as suboptimal because he had been riding them for many years) had already been worn out.
If I think about having to change my tire at 80-90 km, I really feel bad:D
I was talking to an older man at the train station who asked me why I didn't have the Marathon Plus tires; these are supposed to be indestructible.
It sounds very attractive now.
Are these really broken?
I don't have the desire to spend 40€ on tires, only to be disappointed.
I am still asking: I believe I am pedalling my bike 25 times 622.
There are also Marathon Plus tires, but the majority is wider.
Is there a problem?
Would you recommend another type of tire for a bicycle in general?
The page seems to recommend Durano DD to me.
Thank you in advance for the help and loving greetings!
The car was propelled against the tree: The driver was killed.
The 53-year-old man was traveling on the B57 between Rheinberg and Xanten when his car collided with a central island for unknown reasons and then veered off the road, according to the police.
There was a head-on collision with the vehicle of a 27-year-old.
The 53-year-old's car was then thrown against a tree and the man was trapped inside the vehicle.
The 27-year-old driver and his 23-year-old passenger were severely injured in the accident and were taken to nearby hospitals.
We have deleted all books and authorized new ones.

After the publication of our new High End Broadband B 100- 6 Ohm, it was only a matter of time before our SOLO series got some new blood.
The new sprout is called SOLO 15 and it resembles the great predecessors with the B 200 - 6 OHM.
Although this design includes a suitable foot to raise the speaker to the correct listening position.
This has no influence on acoustics and can therefore be adapted accordingly to the given circumstances at home.
It is suitable for people for whom the maximum volume is of secondary importance, but sound quality should be exceptionally high.
A 10 cm speaker is not able to generate near-unfiltered loud sound pressure levels.
That does not mean that the SOLO 15 sounds weak.
In contrast, she stands out impressively mature and strikingly accurate.
The tone was set with a slight high-pitched increase.
This is commonly done with broadband signals to optimize the increasing bundling of high frequencies.
The SOLO 15 impresses with its precise sound placement and clear, fine sound.
The high tones can be reduced externally and so the sound image can be warmed up.
Thanks to the point source, the location of each component of a music piece is precisely and amazingly sharp.
The low mechanical losses of the B100 - 6 Ohm generate an enemy dynamics that seeks its own.
The SOLO 15 not only expands our SOLO series, but also increases its resolution and accuracy.
It is advisable to think about the final appearance of the speaker at the beginning of the construction process in order to plan appropriate modifications.
In order to furnish the case, the lowering of the speaker must be adjusted accordingly, as the furniture adds additional material.
After the plates were cut (e.g. in the hardware store), one should first drill an 8 mm hole in the floor plate at the corresponding location, in order to be able to easily run the cable through it later.
With the help of a saw, the speaker opening in the front is now followed, so that the B 100 - 6 Ohm can be connected laterally.
The opening should be faced with a 45° phase in order to maximize the interior opening of the speaker chassis.
The four connection points of the B 100 - 6 OHM receive a break in the phase, as shown in the image "Detail Phase".
One begins with the actual construction of the box and places one of the two side walls on a level surface in front of oneself.
Now the back, top, front, and floor will be glued.
In addition, the three reinforcements should be installed and glued.
The reinforcements can vary in thickness depending on the need, for example, if one wants to use pre-made frames from the hardware store instead of making them from 16 mm MDF.
In the next step, the second page will be attached.
After the heels, both sides, and the front.
Through the use of a chisel saw or a forstner bit, the installation of the openings of the bass reflex port as well as the connection clamp on the back wall can be facilitated.
Afterwards, one uses a router to smooth out all the edges of the actual box.
The top of the footrest can also be rounded off.
The heel of the housing is glued to the floor plate and additionally secured with long wood screws.
Following the drilling and tapping (2.5 mm) of the fixing points of the speaker chassis and the connector.
After the case has been cleaned of wood dust (absaugen / ausblasen), one begins to place the cable.
This is achieved simplest through the 35 mm bass reflex port in the rear wall.
When inserting the entire and unabridged cable piece by piece through the 8 mm borehole in the foot until the terminal opening and letting it hang out approximately 30 cm.
At the top of the housing, one leads the cable to the speaker opening and lets it hang loosely there.
The frequency switch is prepared and installed next.
The plans for the frequency switch, as well as the corresponding connection plan, can be obtained from the following document: Installation Manual Frequency Switch Solo 15.
The frequency switch has been installed and the connection terminal has been secured, followed by the sealing of the 8 mm opening inside the box, which is still uncompleted.
Through the 35 mm threaded opening and with a bit of skill, one can drizzle hot glue onto the opening and seal it.
By opening the B 100 - 6 OHM and with a small lamp, one can check the sealing accordingly.
Follows the description.
After that, the B 100 - 6 OHM is connected and secured with the appropriate screws.
The polarity is important, so that the positive lead (marked cable) must be connected to the positive terminal of the speaker (larger contact).
At the end, the bass reflex pipe is shortened to the given length of 28 mm (total length of the pipe) and inserted.
To reduce noise, a mat of damping material is cut into two parts and evenly distributed in the housing.
The opening of the bass reflex channel should be kept clear.
Can I cancel the order and have it delivered in June instead?
Hello everyone.
We can finally announce that we will be hosting the OSCAST again this year!
It is unfortunately not possible to get more than four people into the studio due to higher planning costs and the short notice of the announcement.
At least three people will be present so that we can watch the Oscars 2021 with at least 7 beans in the stream and hopefully thousands of you!
We do our best to avoid delays or other problems.
However, it is still a pandemic - nevertheless, we will do our best to make the Oscars as entertaining as possible.
It will start at around 0:30.
Set up some cold drinks, prepare good food, and get ready for an interesting, long night.
