In my opinion, the literature program was formed by women of Balzac's age based on their interests.
From 19th century Russian literature we preferred Danilevsky and Volkonsky.
They wrote fiction, of course, from the perspective of those same ballerina ladies.
And the psychology and sufferings of the heroines of Tolstoy and Turgenev are not so interesting for adolescents.
Teenagers are rarely interested in the psychology of the characters.
Thank you very much, very interesting.

Mattress Promtex Micropacket Prestige 105x195.
Micropack Prestige: comfort and natural composition.
The mattress has different firmness levels: a medium-firm surface made of latex coconut fibre and natural latex, and a moderately soft surface made of natural latex.
The spring block with 1000 springs per square metre quickly adapts to the body of a sleeping person, preventing the 'wave' or 'hummock' effect.
A virtue of the model is that it "breathes".
Latex, perforated for breathability, vents naturally like coconut coir.
This helps maintain a healthy microclimate in the sleeping area.
The same applies to the guarantee period.
The official warranty from the manufacturer is 5 years, but in fact, the service life of the mattress is even longer.
The protection against dust and contamination is provided by a removable cover made of Jacquard, which is supplied in the set.
Buy a pair of orthopedic pillows - they are recommended for maintaining the optimal position of the spine during sleep.
The filler determines the purpose - coconut serves anatomical support for the spine, while latex relaxes muscles.

Germany: The fourth coronavirus vaccine is inevitable
A fourth vaccination will be required in summer or autumn 2022.
According to experts, the current vaccination campaign in Germany will not be the final one, but will continue with new force.
Despite an active vaccination campaign in Germany, two or three doses of the coronavirus vaccine is likely not enough for complete protection.
The head of the Association of General Practitioners, Ulrich Weigel, is convinced of this.
This was reported by Die Welt on Saturday, 11 December.
We are expecting that a fourth dose will be required in the summer, at the latest in the autumn, said the expert.
Wiegelmann also hopes that a fourth COVID-19 vaccine can be given "in combination with a flu vaccine."
This will help achieve the best results.
In addition, booster shots may help combat the spread of the new coronavirus "Omicron" strain.
And the new version is particularly dangerous.
Therefore, the probability of re-infection with Omikron is three times higher than with Delta or Beta strains.
This is confirmed by the results of a preliminary study conducted in South Africa.
As a result, manufacturers BioNTech / Pfizer plan to provide a vaccine adapted to Omikron by March 2022.
Companies stress that two doses of the vaccine do not provide sufficient protection against infection with the new "Omicron" variant of the coronavirus.
The study by BioNTech and Pfizer showed that two doses of the vaccine are significantly less effective: "the neutralising potential is reduced by more than 25 times".
This indicates that two doses of BNT162b2 do not provide sufficient protection against omega strain infection, BioNTech and Pfizer said.
This is why a third dose is needed.
Experts are urging the country to speed up its vaccination rate.
For example, the president of the German Society for Infectious Diseases, Bernhard Salzberger, speaks in favor of reducing the interval between the second and third vaccinations.
Moreover, as Salzberger believes, accelerated vaccination will affect the spread of both the Delta virus and the omega variant of the coronavirus.
The experience of Israel is a convincing example of this, he stressed.
Wabler Pontoon21, Bet-A Vib, 54 Silent, 54 mm, 8.5 g.
The Bet-A-Vib series is a special branch of the Bet-A family from the company Pontoon21®.
It (like the Kalikana Vib series) differs from many other vibes because it was originally designed for sub-ice fishing, as well as for jigging.
These whiskers have a greater density than close analogues, which undoubtedly has a positive effect on the use of these interesting devices.
Another recognizable feature - the upper lacing from durable and elastic plastic, creating additional vibrations during vertical and horizontal cabling.
As a "winter bite" when fishing in the vertical Bet-A-Vib demonstrates quite aggressive game.
The most noticeable thing is the simple monotonous animation, i.e. the movements of the elevator up-and-down without pauses.
When planning a deviation from the vertical axis, the angle is not too great, which is convenient when fishing in limited space, overgrown with underwater vegetation, weeds and other obstacles, which can snag.
In addition, a small deviation is relevant when fishing for pike and large perch, and especially in the middle of winter, when accurate and aggressive bait presentation is required.
Reaching the extreme point of the trajectory, Bet-A-Vib instantly folds and returns to the starting vertical.
Just as successfully Bet-A-Vib is used for winter pike fishing.
To suit its caprices, you can choose from two versions: with a noisy capsule (NS – NanoSound) or without it (SL – Silent).
It is also noted that the Bet-A-Vib game can excite a passive pike that would not even react to a live bait.
The Bet-A-Vib lure demonstrates distance and accuracy.
This wreath is understandable and not capricious, it is well combined with willow and plaited cords even of large diameters.
For catching perch, pike, bream or roach, apart from a uniform bait, "a step", sometimes with "tapping" on the bottom, is also effective.
If you are catching in snagged areas, you can change the lead treble to a double, which reduces the risk of snags.
A mid-range performer in its class, Bet-A-Vib is among the most robust and, as a result, one of the most attractive.
It can be used with equal success on relatively small and on quite deep sections.
All models are equipped with Owner ST-36 hooks.

Libya says 7,000 Russian mercenaries operating
There are more than 7,000 private military company (PMC) Wagner contractors in Libya.
This was stated by the Chairman of the Higher State Council of the Republic, Khaled al-Mishri, on Sunday, December 12.
Currently in Libya there are more than 7,000 Wagner contractors.
They have planes as well.
They are also digging trenches in Sirte and Kufra.
There are 30 reactors at the airbases of Gardabia (it is also used as a civilian airport in Sirte)," the agency Anadolu quoted him as saying.
Haled al-Mishri also said that Russian mercenaries are "trying to capture" central Libya, stretching from Chad to the Mediterranean, after "putting their man in power" in the Central African Republic.
Presence
According to the publication's interlocutor, Moscow was looking for a country to keep its presence in North Africa and "chose Libya".
Wagner has been in Libya since 2019, using airbases and ports in Sirte as well as an airbase in Jufra, the agency reported.
The Russian authorities officially deny that the Wagner Group enjoys the support of the Kremlin.
Where can I find mercenaries
According to the agency, "Wagner" is allegedly active in nine African countries - the Central African Republic, Libya, Sudan, Mozambique, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Madagascar, Zimbabwe and Angola.
The company provides military training for local forces, personal security for leaders and protection of energy facilities.
In exchange for these services, subsidiary companies of "Vagner" receive certain privileges and licenses for the use of useful minerals and natural resources, as well as for the supply of weapons, technologies and military services to these countries," the article says.
As the media claims, "Wagnerites" allegedly fought in Donbass, Syria, Mozambique, Sudan and the Central African Republic.
This group is not registered in law enforcement agencies, nor in the register of legal entities, and its fighters are not in the summary lists of the personnel.
This company is under sanctions of the USA.
It should be recalled that previously the restrictions against "Wagner" were approved by the presidents of 27 EU countries.
The decision is expected to be endorsed by the EU Council on December 13.
The situation in Libya
The Higher State Council of Libya de facto became the second chamber of parliament with consultative functions dominated by Islamists, writes TASS.
The body called repeatedly for the election day to be postponed until at least February 2022.
With less than two weeks before the vote, the chances of it being held on time are diminishing, the report says.
In this context, the Higher Election Commission of Libya postponed indefinitely the announcement of the final list of candidates, the Sky News Arabia channel reports.
Russia's foreign policy through the eyes of Russians
38% of Russians see more successes than failures in the country's foreign policy, 29% believe that failures prevail.
Examples of achievements - "we defended and restored peace in Syria", "a decision on the Northern Stream-2", "the whole world was scared by our cool weapons", "we took Crimea".
The main failures are "the conflict with Ukraine", "confrontation with Western countries" and "isolation from the world", says a study by the Public Opinion Foundation.
The government of Dubai has fully refused paperwork - all public services have also become digital
The government of Dubai has announced a complete refusal of paperwork and a transition to digital technology.
All public services for the population will also be provided exclusively in electronic form.
This was reported by the Emirates News Agency WAM.
Today marks the beginning of a new phase of digitalization of all aspects of life in Dubai - we have completed the transition to a fully paperless government, the Crown Prince of the Emirate, Chairman of the Dubai Executive Council, Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, said on Saturday.
Now, internal and external document circulation in all government institutions in Dubai will only be in digital form through special information platforms.
The innovation affects all sectors without exception: healthcare, housing and communal services, police, municipal authorities, courts, and so on. Many commercial structures have also joined the initiative of the government.
The transition to e-government and digital document circulation began in Dubai in 2018.
During this time, authorities calculated that 33.6 million sheets of paper were saved, which amounts to 1.4 million hours of human labor and $353.8 million in monetary terms.
Earlier, Moscow mayor Sergei Sobyanin said that electronic services save citizens 2 days a year.
Well, yes, about dates of birth and how many years a child is, this is already a mania, about the class and the group in the kindergarten too.

Turkish car production and exports fall below 2020 level
Turkish car production and exports plunged in November as the lira weakened.
As a result, the indicators of the industry as of the end of 11 months turned out to be worse than the previous year's results, Bloomberg reported, citing data from the Association of Automotive Manufacturers of Turkey.
According to the association, in November 115,000 vehicles were released from factories in Turkey, which is 20% less than the previous year.
Around 75,900 machines were exported, which is a more than 25% fall from last year's figure.
And if in the first 10 months of this year the Turkish automotive sector demonstrated positive dynamics compared to the previous year, then as a result of 11 months of 2021, automotive production turned out to be 0.3% worse than the previous year's figure.
The reason for such a fall was a sharp devaluation of the Turkish lira, which in November weakened by 29% against the dollar.
This led to a decline in economic activity in all sectors.
More than 500 SMEs received deferrals on credit payments in 2021
Deputy Prime Minister Alihan Smailov spoke about the situation with the provision of preferences for small and medium-sized businesses, the correspondent of the MIA "Kazinform" reports.
According to the information of the Agency of the Republic of Kazakhstan on the regulation and development of the financial market, in the current year, pursuant to the instruction of the Head of State dated April 1, 2021, Order No. 127 "On Approving the Procedure for Granting Deferrals of Payments on Loans to Small and Medium-Sized Businesses" was approved by the Chairman of the Agency on April 9, 2021, - Alihan Smailov wrote in his answer to the parliamentary inquiry.
He recalled that the order on deferring payments on loans provided for banks and microfinance organizations to defer payments on credits issued before April 1, 2021, to subjects of the MSR, including individual entrepreneurs, from April 1 to June 30, 2021.
The period of deferment ranged from 30 to 90 days, as chosen by the subject of the MSB.
The borrower may have specified a different period for the deferral of payments in the statement.
The period of deferment in relation to the borrower has been suspended, claims and lawsuits, notifications of the need to repay overdue debt, as well as the charging of interest and other payments by the creditor have been stopped, - the Deputy Prime Minister noted.
In 2021, second-tier banks received 603 applications for loan repayment deferrals from 553 MSME borrowers, with a total deferral amount of 9.7 billion tenge.
Applications for deferment were submitted to the MFO by 131 subjects of the MSR, of which deferment was granted to 95 subjects for a total of 105.8 million tenge," Smailov concluded.
Pulmonologist Puretsky assumed that people with a weak immune system can easily tolerate the "Okamir" strain
The doctor suggested that those with weakened immune systems may be able to tolerate it better than those with a strong body reaction
Pulmonologist Sergei Puryazev explained why the "ocarina" strain of coronavirus may be dangerous.
The reason for this is in the conditions in which the virus was born.
Scientists believe that "okimron" is born in the tele infected with HIV or suffering from immunodeficiency.
In other words, when mutated, it did not meet any immune resistance.
This makes him more aggressive.
Because there was no immune response, it became very fast.
It is likely that there are more of these spike proteins, spikes there, their antibodies do not cut during mutations, - comments pulmonologist Sergei Puryazev.
The vaccine is expected to work better in people with weakened immune systems than in those whose bodies are able to mount a strong defense reaction.
It turns out that a strong response to something, to any infection, is not always a good thing.
In those cases, the organism may kill itself.
That's what happens with pneumococcal infections when a 30-year-old dies while the 60-year-olds cough it off.
The immune response of a maddened young man is inadequate: where he could have only threatened with a finger, he strikes like cannon fire against sparrows - concluded Sergei Puryazev.
The doctor also reminded that the coronavirus has dangerous side effects, the worst of which is pneumonia.
Pneumonia is bacterial and viral.
If the first is treated very successfully and quickly, in the second case you can often only palliate the symptoms - all hope is on the body.
The first sign of developing pneumonia will be the beginning of intoxication of the organism - this is a temperature, weakness, shortness of breath.
Then there are respiratory symptoms: shortness of breath, a sore throat, a cough.
Pain on the right or left, abdominal pain may also indicate a developing problem.
Meanwhile in Russia children aged between 12 and 18 will be vaccinated from the beginning of the year.
Virologist and head of the genetic engineering laboratory at MFTI Pavel Volochkov noted that this category is very actively affected by the coronavirus.
Teenagers who are in school have the most contact.
This is the most socially active layer, as well as the children who attend kindergartens, said Pavel Volchkov, a virologist and head of the genetic engineering laboratory at MFTI, to Moscow 24.

Immunologists have put forward a hypothesis as to why obese people become victims of COVID
The researchers studied fat tissue remaining after bariatric surgery and found that the fat cells known as adipocytes can harbor the coronavirus.
Immune cells, located in fat tissue, macrophages, also became infected, and showed a strong inflammatory response while doing so.
Scientists also examined fat tissue from patients who died of Covid and found virus particles in the fat surrounding various organs.
It is known that viruses such as HIV and flu can hide in fatty tissue, using it as a reservoir, in an attempt to evade the immune system.
It is likely that SARS-CoV-2 can do the same.
Biologist told about the reasons of dementia appearance
Candidate of Biological Sciences Semen Goloshekin named the reasons for the appearance of dementia and told about the ways of its prevention in an interview with Sputnik radio.
According to WHO data, more than 5.5 million people suffer from this disease.
The syndrome is characterised by a gradual loss of cognitive functions - over time, a person has difficulty orientating themselves even in a familiar environment.
Goloshekin said that dementia is most often caused by neurodegenerative disorders, head injuries, some infections, metabolic disorders and a lack of certain vitamins.
Some factors increase the risk of developing the disease.
This includes hypertension, diabetes, high cholesterol, obesity, depression, and alcoholism.
On a behavioral level, the role of factors such as social isolation and lack of active cognitive activity should be considered," he said.
The development of dementia is also influenced by harmful habits - smoking, alcohol abuse, disruption of the sleep regime and a sedentary lifestyle.
The expert noted the first symptoms as forgetfulness, inability to concentrate and reduction of abstract thinking level.
There is debate as to whether hearing loss is an early manifestation of Alzheimer's or a risk factor for its development, the biologist said.
For the prevention of the disease, the WHO recommends maintaining a necessary level of physical activity, training cognitive skills and abilities that require memory and logic.
Previously, he was a professor of the department of neurology, neurosurgery and medical genetics of the Federal State Autonomous Educational Institution of the National Medical University named after N.I. Pirogov.
N.I. Pyrogova, head of the department of cognitive disorders at the Federal Brain and Neurotechnologies Center, Anna Bogolevskaya told about the reasons for memory problems.
Egypt has returned around 30,000 illegally smuggled artifacts
Over the past 10 years, the government of Cairo has managed to return about 300,000 artifacts that were illegally smuggled out of the country.
This was reported on Saturday, December 11, by the head of the department of returned antiquities at the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities of Egypt, Shaaban Abd El Gawad, on the television channel Al-Hayat.
Since 2011, the Egyptian government has managed to retrieve 29,300 artifacts.
Only this year 5300 Egyptian antiquities were discovered in the Bible Museum in Washington," he said.
Abdel Gawad specified that all smuggled artifacts were registered in the archives.
Now department staff are working on their return to Egypt.
In particular, experts are "tracking auctions around the world and sales on the internet" through foreign and Egyptian websites, as well as social networks.
The chief inspector said that on return of the cultural values they are restored and then exhibited in museums.
One of the returned artifacts was a ancient human skeleton found in Belgium that is now part of the collection of the National Museum of Egyptian Civilization in Cairo, he said.
In 2020, Egyptian authorities asked Interpol to help find a bust of Pharaoh Tutankhamun sold at an auction in London.
Auction house Christie's held sales on July 4, when a bust more than 3,000 years old was sold for $5.97 million (around 680 million rubles).
This caused discontent from Egypt.
The Egyptian side also claims that the object was illegally removed from the Karnak Temple in Luxor in the 1970s.
The head of Tutankhamun, depicted in the form of the sun god Amon, has been in a private collection and not put up for sale since 1985.
How the relic made it to Europe is a mystery.
Egypt in recent years has actively sought the repatriation of illegally removed ancient monuments from the country at different times.
According to the authorities, 95% of smuggled antiquities are the result of "black diggers" archaeological finds.

They are united only by the Turkic language group.
FT: Credit Suisse wants access to employees' personal mobile devices
Credit Suisse has asked employees to give the bank access to their personal mobile devices, the Financial Times reports.
The matter is that in Europe and the USA, the Swiss bank does not provide corporate communication devices to its employees, instead offering a discount on the purchase of mobile phones or smartphones from a partner - a telecommunications operator.
Under current rules, banks are allowed to scrutinize data on corporate devices given to employees for work purposes as they are used to communicate with colleagues and clients.
The bank has the right to inspect mobile devices in extreme cases - for example, if an employee used it to conduct a meeting with a client that was not approved by Credit Suisse.
Now, however, with many staff working from home, the bank wants to extend the rule to all devices used for work purposes.
According to the newspaper, the bank's management set a deadline for employees to familiarise themselves with the new rule.
Credit Suisse declined to comment on the new demand.

Part 4
The last year of Sergei Esenin's life - 1925 - was productive in terms of creativity, but was the hardest for the poet's earthly existence and his "ego".
He is not a member of any literary unions, he has no connection with Imagism, he is known, in demand, criticised, sometimes harshly, but the reading public is ready to carry him on its hands.
More than 60 poems were written during the year, many of them true masterpieces, the cycle of Persian motifs was completed, the poem "Anna Snegina" was written, and eight books were published, including the collection "Rus Soviet".
And the main success - at the end of June 25th year - Gosizdat concluded a contract with Yessenin for the publication of his works in 3 volumes.
No contemporary poet has been awarded this honour before - he is the first!
In addition, this promised very good money - the contract stipulated a monthly salary of 1000 rubles for 20 months (for example, the factory director received 300 rubles per month, and the engineer received 200).
The money was needed then more than ever.
Esenin married Leo Tolstoy's granddaughter Sofia Tolstaya, and had to provide for his sisters Katy and Sasha, as well as his mother.
So life seemed to be improving, there was something to be happy about, but for him it was all overshadowed by dark tones, as if a nightmare from Esenin's poem "The Black Man" (written in November 1925 and published after his death):
My friend, my friend.
I am very and very sick.
I do not know where this pain came from.
Whether the wind is whistling
Over the empty and deserted field,
Therefore, as in September,
The brain is affected by alcohol.
Many acquaintances noted that Yesenin was very weak, looked bad, and was obviously ill.
More and more often there are repetitions, nervous breakdowns.
And the reason for that is likely not just alcohol...
By the way, if such a diagnosis - alcoholism - was given to Sergei Alexanderovich, there are no reliable documents.
Speaking of May 1923, when, at the insistence of his fourth wife, the American Isadora Duncan, Esenin was treating his health in a clinic in Paris under Professor Petr Gannushkin (two years later, already in Moscow, Esenin will return to him again).
And as for the poet’s evidence, the scandals based on this, reports to the police are in abundance – dozens of memoirs have been published.
Early in the 20s, the poet's terrible romance with the green snake rapidly developed.
At the end of the summer of 1923, Esenin stayed with his friend, the imagist Ivan Starcev.
Surprisingly, given his very good earnings, Yesenin never had his own accommodation in Moscow or St Petersburg, he lived in rented flats, hotels or with friends.
Starcev remembers:
He would only come to sleep and, in most cases, in an incoherent, drunken state.
One day, at four in the morning, Esenin fell on the stairway...
Padaia fell to his knees and wailed.
After a moment he began to cough uncontrollably, spraying blood everywhere."
And even Esenin himself after his travels in Europe and the USA (at that time there was a dry law in the States, but Duncan took a decent supply of spirits with him) admitted:
I didn't see anything there, just cabbage and streets...
I am already at the end and I have stopped remembering people...
Well, of course...
So I did it because I was fed up."

Matras Promatex-Orient Duet Latex Econom 100x195
Promtex-Orient Duet Latex Econom - a modern interpretation of the budget model in the line of premium class.
The foundation of the mattress – a block of independent double springs Duet.
A small spring is inserted into the large spring.
This allows for the load to be evenly distributed across the mattress.
The mattress is filled with artificial latex from both sides.
This is an analogue of natural latex, but it is denser and cheaper.
The flexibility and resilience of this material improves the comfort effect of the mattress.
The artificial latex is hypoallergenic, it does not absorb moisture and dust.
Matras would be a great pair with a big weight difference (up to 30 kilograms).
There is no "smart" spring effect here, when the light partner slips to the side of the heavy one.
The friendly, soft to the touch case is made from practical Jacquard Sense fabric.
Natural fabrics do not accumulate static electricity.
It is possible to make this mattress model in a twisted version (vacuum packaging).
Now his son is almost 16 and the desire to smoke is long gone.

And love, as Lermontov wrote, "strange love".
Why did the girl cry during the exam when she hadn't even failed it?
Why he didn't tell his daughter it was not a school
It will have a tail.
Well?

Poland's foreign ministry believes Belarus is using migrants as "weapon" against EU
Poland's foreign ministry believes Belarus is using migrants as "weapon"
Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of Poland Pawel Jabłoński expressed the opinion that President of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko used refugees as "weapon" against the European Union and intends to return to such "operation" next year.
The corresponding statement was made by the Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs in an interview with the Australian Financial Review newspaper.
According to Yabloko, the sanctions against Belarus have "temporarily stopped Lukashenko", but he is "actively looking for new ways".
A Polish official was also confident that now illegal migrants would be used as a weapon "in many points of the world."
As reported by the website kp.ru, the European Union had previously introduced the fifth package of sanctions against Belarus.
He touched 17 physical persons and 11 organizations.
In Europe, they declared readiness and will further restrict limiting measures against the republic "if the situation in the country does not improve".
In response, Minsk introduced a food embargo on a wide range of goods from countries that had previously imposed sanctions against Belarus.

Not a beret: when a camel coat makes a man a laughing stock
At the secular events of 2021, the satin jackets dominated.
Actually, the first to announce his new fashion venture was Daniel Craig.
Still in September, at the premiere of the "Time to Die" film, he appeared in a camel-hair overcoat and traditional "Bond" bow-tie.
Prince William followed in his footsteps twice, first by choosing an inappropriate green velvet jacket for the ceremony of the Earthshot Prize and then opting for a more classic line for the event in aid of the Royal Variety Charity.
A couple of weeks ago the trend caught the eye of Lionel Messi.
The footballer arrived to pick up the seventh "Golden Ball" in a Dolce & Gabbana silk tie.
His sons were dressed in similar ones.
AliExpress has already noted the growing demand for silk men’s jackets in Russia.
According to analytics service data received by Gazeta.Ru, their number has increased 1.4 times.
The most popular are warm velvet jackets with linings and contoured silhouettes in shades of dark brown, navy, dark blue and, of course, black.
The average price for such models is from 30,000 to 60,000 rubles. At the same time, men prefer to buy exclusively jackets - suits are chosen by them less often.
They can be bought not only from online retailers.
Budget options include H&M, Mango, Next and Zara.
In the luxury section, the barathea segment is represented by practically every brand - Brioni, Paul Smith, Etro, Saint Laurent.
The most desired model is the Gucci one in which the ambassador of the brand, Jared Leto, appeared in one of the first "Gucci" films.
By choosing an expensive brand, you can be sure that the leather is made from silk.
Thanks to a special weaving technology, a dense fabric with a knobby outer texture and smooth inner side is obtained.
Budget versions are made from cotton or polyamide, but, accordingly, they serve less.
Fashion expert for Lamoda Ilia Vakushkin warns that in the case of a camel coat the key thing is whether it is appropriate.
A barathea demands evening light, so this jacket is ideal if you are going to an evening or a celebratory event, explains Vakochkin. It is also suitable for those cases if the invitation specifies a "Black Tie" or "Creative Black Tie" dress code.
Another important criterion, which allows to choose a velvet jacket, is the status of its buyer.
A man in a velvet jacket, above all, must have a proper advanced knot, - the authors of the Telegram channel about male fashion "Krasavets Brammell" believe. - Owners of velvet jackets, as a rule, belong to the caste of people who rarely buy tickets.
They are simply invited to secular events, where a dress code is always specified.
Ilya Vakushkin suggests combining a velvet jacket with such elegant items: classic trousers with stripes, one-color shirts, silk scarves, lace collars, brooches.
Very simple and everyday things will look out of place.
Fashion experts from "Krasavchik Brammell" are confident: it would be inappropriate for an ordinary employee to appear in a velvet jacket at a corporate event, but if we are talking about "a director, who is in charge of this project, then - yes, such an item is relevant".
If you are a servant who ranks down and your goal is to move up in the complex hierarchy of the company or fight for financial bonuses, then it's better not to wear a silk tie.
It's precisely an assessment of the phrase "not a peasant's cap" - believe the editors of the Telegram channel on men's fashion.
Very ambiguous feelings about the voice.
This unnatural tone, so strained.
And does not at all resemble the cute face of a young girl.
If honestly, I do not understand the admiration of those around me.
But I wish you all the best in life!
It's all about the money - alternative energy is lobbied for, i.e. paid for.
Billion investments.
Are they crying?
No, the price of electricity has increased.
Traditional energy is also not in stock - and gas, oil and coal were cheaper than now.
Wild demand for fuel.
A penny corks.
But who was in the air?
As usually - an average consumer.
Does the sheriff care about Indian issues?
Therefore, Western politicians should not consider Russians as idiots, "sleeping" through the energy crisis.
They did their job.
For a good mind.
Did not see a single beautiful person in the pictures in the article.
Just mediocre for an average passenger.
Perhaps if such characters are so confident in their beauty that they decide to show this to the whole carriage, then such people are unlikely to be attracted to them, probably.
But only because of psychological disorder and ignorance such "beauties" (-ies), but certainly not because of their appearance.
A Kazakh who "knows his slave status and struggles against it is a revolutionary."
A slave who does not recognize his slavery and lives a mute, unconscious, and speechless slave life is simply a slave.
A slave, whose saliva flows when he self-importantly describes the beauty of slave life and is delighted with a good and kind master, is a lackey."
An immunologist said that re-vaccination in 4-5 months will help protect against the "omicron" strain of the coronavirus
Revaccination four to five months later may protect against a new strain of coronavirus "omicron".
This is what immunologist Nikolai Kruglov said, who called six months, with account of a new strain, "a very long period"
Under previous strains, such a term was normal, but now it is better to carry out the procedure five months after, and people with chronic illnesses - four months after, - expert said, urging to carry out revaccination parallel to the vaccination campaign.
Kruchkov also noted that early revaccination provides a good titer of neutralizing antibodies.
If a person has had two doses of the vaccine and a booster, or has recovered from the disease and been vaccinated, or has been vaccinated and then recovered, they will have acquired a "hybrid immunity", that is, antibodies are present in sufficient quantities to neutralise the virus, the expert explained.
The G7 warned Russia of "serious consequences" in the event of an invasion of Ukraine
The "Big Seven" countries (Britain, Germany, Italy, Canada, the United States, France and Japan) issued a statement following the foreign ministers' meeting in Liverpool.
It emphasizes that "the military aggression" of Russia against Ukraine "will have huge consequences and will be expensive" for Moscow, but concrete measures in the document are not described.
We, the foreign ministers of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States of America, and the High Representative of the European Union, stand united in condemning Russia's military build-up and aggressive rhetoric towards Ukraine, the statement reads.
The ministers then called on Russia "to deescalate, to use diplomatic channels, and to abide by its international obligations on transparency in military activities," which President Biden mentioned during a video message to Russian President Putin on December 7.
We confirm our support for the efforts of France and Germany in the Normandy format to achieve full implementation of the Minsk agreements with the goal of resolving the conflict in eastern Ukraine," the foreign ministers of the "Big Seven" also stated.
The use of force for border changes is strictly prohibited by international law.
Russia must not doubt that further military aggression against Ukraine will have enormous consequences and a serious price in response," they warn.
We reaffirm our unwavering commitment to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, as well as the right of any sovereign state to determine its own future.
We welcome Ukraine's restrained position.
We will intensify our cooperation in response to our joint comprehensive response," the statement also said.
Earlier today, the head of British diplomacy, Elizabeth Truss, stated that Russia would face "serious consequences" in the event of an invasion of Ukraine.
According to her, this meeting showed "the single voice of the G7 countries, which account for 50% of the world's GDP, which clearly said that the invasion in Ukraine will have huge consequences for Russia".
Pfizer's vaccine was 32 times less effective against the omega strain
Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is 32 times less effective against the omega strain of coronavirus than against other types of the disease.
This conclusion was reached by scientists from the University of Hong Kong and the Chinese University of Hong Kong, the South China Morning Post (SCMP) reports.
The vaccine was found to be less effective based on a study of antiviral activity in people who received two doses of the COVID-19 vaccine.
We see that most people had high levels of antiviral activity against the original Sars-CoV-2 strain, but this ability was significantly reduced against the omega variant, Professor Malik Peiris said.
At the same time, scientists stressed that vaccination is the most reliable way to protect against severe courses of the disease when infected with the coronavirus.
Earlier, scientists from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine predicted the development of the pandemic, taking into account the influence of the omega strain.
The study authors concluded that the omega strain could cause a new wave of circulation and increase mortality if additional measures are not taken.
Ukraine's defense minister accused Germany of blocking the delivery of NATO weapons to Kiev
The head of the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense, Alexei Reznikov, accused the government of former German Chancellor Angela Merkel of blocking Kiev's acquisition of lethal weapons within NATO.
In an interview with the Financial Times newspaper on December 12, Reznik reminded that in the previous month Germany had vetoed the purchase by Ukraine of anti-sniper systems and rifles to combat drones.
It is noted that later Berlin softened its position on firearms, recognizing them as lethal weapons.
According to the Minister of Defense, Kiev intends to acquire the aforementioned weapons through bilateral agreements with allies.
In particular, this refers to the United States, Great Britain, Lithuania and France.
Meanwhile, the FT notes that the position of the new German government under the leadership of Chancellor Angela Merkel on the issue of resolving the supply of weapons to Ukraine remains unclear.
Earlier on Sunday, Ukraine's ambassador to Germany Andriy Melnyk said that Kiev should not hope for weapons supplies from Berlin while Chancellor Scholz is in power.
According to him, the previous leadership of Germany explained its refusal to provide weapons by the risk of escalation of the conflict in Donbass, despite the "occupation of Russia" of part of Ukrainian territory.
The diplomat is confident that Germany will retain such an "unlogical" position even with a new chancellor.
In August, Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky said that Kiev is expecting help from Berlin in equipping its naval fleet.
Ukraine hopes that Germany will be its "partner in the technical sense," the president added.
It was also noted that in the spring of this year, the co-chairman of the German "Green" party, Robert Habeck, visited the republic, where he spoke in favor of selling defensive weapons to Kiev.

Mercedes protests Abu Dhabi Grand Prix result
The German Mercedes team, whose pilot Lewis Hamilton finished second behind Red Bull driver Max Verstappen in the Grand Prix in Abu Dhabi, filed a protest against the final race result, according to the Formula 1 press service.
Mercedes believes that the rules of "Formula 1" 48.12 and 48.8 were violated during the race.
In the first case, the German team is disputing the decision of the stewards to return to the circuit racers in one round with the leaders.
According to the second - Ferstapen overtook Hamilton before the "restart" zone was resolved.
It should be added that the result of the Grand Prix in Abu Dhabi, according to which Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen overtook Hamilton by 2.256 seconds and won the world championship in "Formula 1", is preliminary until the protests by Mercedes are considered.
G7 warns Russia of responsibility for invading Ukraine
The foreign ministers of the G7 countries warned of "serious consequences" for Russia if it continues its military aggression against Ukraine, according to the final statement of the parties.
The participants of the meeting also noted that they condemn the increase of Russian armed forces on the country's borders.
There can be no doubt that further military aggression against Ukraine will have serious consequences and serious costs, says a statement published on the website of the British government.
G7 ministers and the EU's top representative noted that they are "united in their condemnation of Russia's military build-up and aggressive rhetoric towards Ukraine."
The British Foreign Secretary, Elizabeth Truss, warned of "serious consequences" for Russia if it invades Ukraine, at a press conference in Liverpool.
We've made it clear that there will be significant consequences for any incursion.
G7 wants Russia to abandon aggression towards Ukraine," she said (quoted by TASS).
Earlier at the summit in Liverpool, G7 foreign ministers agreed that to resolve the crisis over the build-up of Russian troops on the border with Ukraine, both sides need to return to the negotiating table.
The talks were held in the "Normandy format".
The North Atlantic Alliance has also spoken out on the Normandy format dialogue on Ukraine.
Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said that countries in the G7 have "failed to take responsibility for their own mistakes" by calling for Russia and Ukraine to return to the negotiating table.

Ways of returning stolen money through online stores have been revealed
There are several ways to retrieve money stolen through online stores and avoid becoming a victim of fraud in the future.
Experts in information security discussed this with RBC.
So, to reduce the risk of large losses due to the theft of bank cards, it is recommended to keep the main funds on the card or in the bank account, which are not used for online shopping.
Part of the accumulated funds can be deposited into a savings account and withdrawn as necessary.
Experts also recommend keeping a separate card for purchases in stores.
If money was stolen during purchases in stores that do not use 3D Secure technology, the refund process can be initiated.
In line with the rules set by the payment systems, liability for unauthorized transactions conducted without using 3D Secure will be imposed on the participant in the payment chain who does not use this service," the representative of Promsvyazbank specified.
Arthur Zaremba, an expert from international payment provider Ecommpay, underlined that the purchaser has the right to submit a claim to the bank to challenge the fraudulent operation no later than 120 days after the purchase.
In addition, if the perpetrator used a card on online resources that do not require two-factor authentication, the transaction can be contested and the money returned.
It is noted that in some cases, online stores return funds to the client if the order has not yet been sent for delivery.
On November 19, the head of the Safe Internet League and a member of the Public Chamber, Ekaterina Mozzhinina, reported that only in 2021, the league received 11,000 appeals on different cases of fraud: from the sale of counterfeit documents to the theft of personal data.
She said that, in the current circumstances, an effective solution could be to create a single window for complaints about online fraudsters.
Scholz arrived in Poland to discuss "Nord Stream 2" and EU legislation
The newly elected German Chancellor Angela Merkel arrived in Warsaw for talks on the crisis of migrants on the border with Belarus, the independence of the judiciary in Poland, the buildup of Russian troops on the borders of Ukraine, and the situation with the Russian gas pipeline "Nord Stream-2".
Despite Scholz's declared aim to maintain good relations between Germany and Poland for a long time, leaders of both countries expressed unambiguous expectations of each other.
Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said that he would call on Scholz to speak out against "Nord Stream 2," through which Russia plans to deliver gas to Germany via a bypass of Ukraine.
According to Moravec, Russia may use the gas pipeline as a means of political pressure against Europe.
In turn, Germany supported Poland's efforts to stop the flow of migrants trying to enter the country from Belarus.
Berlin said it would help Warsaw and Brussels in resolving the crisis.
Poland's judicial system, however, remains a source of disagreement.
The European Court of Justice has penalized Poland, ruling that the judicial reforms carried out by the right-wing party "Law and Justice" violate EU legislation.
Poland has refused to pay the fine and its top court has ruled that national law takes precedence over EU rules.
Germany's new government, sworn in on Wednesday, made no public commitment to stop Nord Stream 2 in the event of a Russian invasion of Ukraine, despite demands from Poland and the United States.
American officials told Congress members they had reached an understanding with Germany to halt the pipeline if Russia invaded Ukraine, a senior U.S. congressional aide said on Tuesday.
German officials have not confirmed the reports, but Scholz warned of consequences if Russia crosses the border into Ukraine on Wednesday and the "Big Seven" confirmed that position on Sunday.
Dmitry, look more carefully.

Ministry wants to reward writers with residences
The future foundation will receive federal property inherited from the USSR Union of Writers and the Literary Fund of the USSR.
Writers' residencies will be established on the basis of the fund, "Parliamentary Newspaper" reported in the Ministry of Culture, which will act as the founder.
The Ministry of Culture is preparing a presidential decree on the establishment of the Russian Literature Support Fund.
The explanatory note specifies that the fund will be tasked with looking after, among other things, the targeted use and conservation of buildings and structures that once belonged to the Soviet Union's Union of Writers and the Literature Fund.
A significant number of immovable property objects previously belonging to the Literature Fund of the USSR have become the property of the Russian Federation, including objects located in the writers' settlement of Peredelkino, the Komarovo settlement in the Leningrad region and other places, "Parliamentary Newspaper" reported from the Ministry of Culture press service.
The project provides that the charter of the foundation should reflect that it "is established to promote literary activity by creating the necessary conditions for the creative work of writers".
The creation of "conditions for creative activity" involves the creation of writer's residencies in different regions of Russia based on the transferred property, where there would be comfortable conditions for creativity, explained the Ministry of Culture to our publication.

Doctors have warned of the dangers of prolonged use of blood thinners after COVID-19 and before vaccination
Doctors Irina Yarceva and Sergei Tokarev warned about the danger of uncontrolled use of blood thinners after the infection with the coronavirus COVID-19 and before vaccination against the coronavirus.
Physician-therapist and immunologist Irina Yarceva said that independent prevention of possible thrombosis formation after COVID-19 may provoke an stroke.
Yartseva explained that blood thinning agents are not for everyone, only if the patient had been hospitalized, had been in hospital, and had complications.
A doctor prescribes anticoagulants (blood thinners that prevent excessive clotting) as needed.
She said that now there is mania - everyone is taking anticoagulants for a long time and are getting complications in the form of hemorrhagic strokes (bleeding in the brain).
The head of the prophylactic department of Ural Federal University, scientific supervisor of the Society of Prophylactic Medicine specialists, doctor of medical sciences Sergey Tokarev told URA.RU that Russians nowadays often take indiscriminate anticoagulants and before getting vaccinated against the coronavirus infection.
According to Dr Tokarev, people are trusting dodgy advice on the internet and self-medicating.
There are such citizens who, a week before vaccination, start taking anticoagulants on their own decision.
And upon preliminary examination prior to vaccination, doctors note bruising.
He stressed that it is extremely dangerous to take any medication without determining the cause of any symptoms.
Potatoes named superproduct for hypertonia

The plumber will receive 20 thousand dollars, which we found in the wall of the church
A plumber who found money hidden behind a wall at a church in Texas will be rewarded.
The information is contained in a news release from the nonprofit Crime Stoppers of Houston.
The incident happened at Lakewood Church, where the Rev. Joel Osteen preaches a prosperity gospel that promises believers wealth and success.
In November 2021, plumber Justin Cooley was renovating one of the church's restrooms when he stumbled upon thousands of envelopes filled with cash and checks beneath the insulation.
He handed the find to the church and, according to him, did not even receive thanks from Austin.
I wanted to hear him say: 'You know, Justin, you were right.
We understand that you did and that you could do,"" KPRC-TV quoted him as saying.
It is thought the discovery is linked to the theft of the Lakewood Church seven years ago.
Then $2 million in cash and $4 million in checks vanished from the church safe.
The money was insured, so the church did not suffer any losses.
However, a reward of $25,000 was announced for information about the perpetrators.
Justin Coulter was ineligible for the sum as the reward expired.
Despite that, the nonprofit Crime Stoppers of Houston, which had offered a $5,000 reward and later received an additional $20,000 from Lakewood Church, decided to reward the plumber for his honesty.
He will receive $20,000.
Police have interviewed Pastor Joel Austin about the money found in the wall of Lakewood Church.
Tanya, her words, her actions - this is the characteristic of her "as a real person".
Therefore, the attitude towards it is so negative.
And it's not that "it is financially hugely richer than all the other regions", as it is written here.
There are people who are richer, but not everyone behaves so arrogantly, aggressively as this woman.

New bird flu case detected in China
A new case of infection with a highly pathogenic strain of avian influenza virus H5N6 was detected in China.
This was reported by the radio station RTHK with reference to a notice from the Hong Kong health authorities, reports ITAR-TASS.
A 68-year-old resident of the urban district of Huai'an in the southern province of Guangdong became infected after keeping poultry at home.
His condition was described by doctors as critical.
The first known human infection with the H5N6 virus was recorded in May 2014 in the southwestern province of Sichuan.
Since then, the number of such cases in the country has reached 53.
Brazil has made it compulsory for its citizens to present proof of vaccination on entry to the country
Brazil has made it compulsory to demand a COVID-19 passport from those entering the country's territory. The ruling was made by Judge Luis Roberto Barroso of the Federal Supreme Court (STF).
This was reported by CNN Brasil.
Citizens with contraindications to vaccination have been released from the obligation to present a certificate of vaccination.
People arriving from countries where there is no evidence of the vaccine will also be excluded from the list.
The situation is even more serious if we take into account that Brazil is a popular tourist destination for New Year's Eve, pre-Carnival and Carnival celebrations, as well as other events, which implies an increase in tourist flow," Barroso noted.
Brazil had previously forced unvaccinated tourists to observe a five-day quarantine.
A full protection scheme against COVID-19 has been revealed.
Virologist, doctor of medical sciences, and honored scientist of Russia Anatoly Altstein revealed a complete protection scheme from coronavirus infection in an interview with Ura.ru.
This can be done, he says, by introducing a jab and spraying a nasal vaccine.
With intranasal application a large amount of immunoglobulin A is formed. With the introduction of the vaccine by injection this does not happen.
Antibodies protect the mucous membrane, so the virus cannot get into the organism.
And inside us, after vaccination, the formation of immoglobulins G (antibodies) is the biggest.
And if you give both vaccines, you get a lot of A and G antibodies. But there's no decision yet on the double vaccination," the doctor said.
The head of the prophylactic department of the Ural Federal University, doctor of medical sciences Sergey Tokarev, in turn, stated that the main advantage of nasal vaccination together with injections is the possibility to become a non-carrier of the virus.
He added that this would help in that case that the body's defences would presumably be maximised.
Earlier, the Minister of Health of the Nizhny Novgorod region David Melik-Guseynov said that the spread of a new coronavirus infection among children will lead to a new surge of the pandemic of COVID-19.
According to him, just such a picture is observed in other countries, where the next wave of the pandemic came earlier.
Inna, hm...
I was talking to a dog (who died a long time ago) like this - if you are ready to exchange a warm home, care, love and games for a fluffy puppy, then go ahead.
But the pony was trained and quite clever.
I chose my society and went home.
In video mode, which works in 90% of cases.
Not taken from the ceiling, believe me.
I slowed down many owners so that they did not run after their dogs, although they claimed that they were chasing (barking), grabbed their hand and led them to the other side.
In the end, "200 thousand" chose the owner, not the dog, which ran somewhere.
Mass protests against vaccinations continue in Europe
In the Austrian capital, Vienna, more than 40,000 demonstrators took to the streets.
They expressed discontent with restrictive measures and the authorities' plans to make vaccinations against Covid compulsory.
Unvaccinated people will be fined 3600 euros from February next year.
Outraged by the government's healthcare policies, Spaniards staged a peaceful march in Madrid.
Some held placards reading "This is a false pandemic", "I will not be vaccinated".
A major protest against sanitary passports took place in Barcelona, the capital of Catalonia.
In the autonomous community, a COVID certificate is obligatory for access to bars, restaurants, sports halls, retirement homes and night-time entertainment venues.
The decision to introduce sanitary passports by the authorities in a number of regions of the country was taken against the background of an increase in the number of cases of infection with the coronavirus.
In Luxembourg, more than a thousand demonstrators protested against the tightening of restrictive measures and QR codes.
The protest started peacefully but then degenerated into clashes with law enforcement officers.
A group of protesters started hurling stones at police.
In response, law enforcement officers used water cannons.
Nikolay S., even Wikipedia does not have a unified opinion on this matter.
Kasheva-Rudneva is also designated as "the first Russian doctor of medicine", probably because she started studying earlier.
Let's just not argue, I think both are deserving of the title.
Agreeing with Zakharchenko is only one: Americans bring only death and robbery to any country they appear in.

WHO has found "omega" in dozens of countries
The World Health Organization (WHO) said that the new strain of coronavirus, "omega," has been identified in 63 countries.
A number of experts have already said that the spread of the new strain could have catastrophic consequences.
The spread of the strain was reported in a statement from the WHO.
According to the organization, as of December 9, the virus had been identified in 63 countries in all six WHO regions.
This is despite it only being actively spreading since late November.
The WHO has also expressed concern about the high rate of spread of the new coronavirus variant.
Experts from the WHO expressed concern that the new strain, based on preliminary data, could surpass the "delta" strain, which is the Indian variant of the coronavirus that is currently leading in absolutely all countries without exception.
Before that, the Director-General of the World Health Organization Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus stated that the omega strain would have a significant impact on the course of the pandemic of the coronavirus.
Similar conclusions have been reached in Great Britain as well.
Experts at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) believe that "omega" will replace "delta" in the coming months.
The number of cases in Britain alone is expected to reach about 1 million, although officials say only a few hundred people are known to have fallen ill in the kingdom so far.
British experts are predicting tens of thousands of deaths from the Omega strain, with up to 2,000 people a day being admitted to hospital at the height of the outbreak.
The British healthcare system will not be able to cope with this.
The situation is complicated by the fact that, according to recent studies, the efficacy of Pfizer-BioNTech's vaccine against the "omega" strain is 32 times lower than that against other types of infection.
It is not yet known how the Russian "Satellite V" will react to "omegon", this will become clear over the next few weeks.
The Gamaleya Center has only begun testing the Russian vaccine on the Omega strain.

Curious Little Bird, you are right, communication on the Internet - is quite different, it is easy and unconstrained, but in personal meetings and say nothing.
And to see a person live, perhaps, it is not what you expected, it did not grab you - from here the relationship.
When it meets its man, then the glances change.
And again the Soviet time is called the "time of demons".
So people believed in God much more than today.
And they were brought up practically according to God's laws (love your neighbor, don't steal, etc.).
What is the ideology today - money at any cost.
Believers in the likes of Globa are few and far between (if at all), but even if so, the time of the demons arrived in the 90s...
Our Petersburg, or rather Leningrad, communal apartment on Bolshaya Zelenina supports communication to this day.
Of course we're not the closest of friends, but we do try to maintain a warm relationship with the older generation.
Perhaps this is connected with the fact that there were no outsiders in the apartment, the rooms were not rented, and the blockade brotherhood was not cancelled by anyone.
We are seeing them more and more at funerals, unfortunately.

At least seven people died and 175 were injured by powerful rains that hit the northeastern Brazilian state of Bahia and the neighboring state of Minas Gerais.

$13.5 billion went on applications - Hi-Tech
In 2021, app expenditures worldwide grew by 25%, while the number of downloads grew by 8%.
Various video services proved to be the most popular in the world.
The most popular app by far was video editor CapCut, which was used most on YouTube.
The number of app downloads and user spending showed significant growth from January to November 2021.
The number of downloads increased by 8%, reaching 14 billion. Spending by users in apps increased by a significant 25%, to a record $135 billion.
This data was published by analytical company App Annie, which presented a report on the mobile application market in 2021.
In 2021, the global economy exited the recession and began post-pandemic recovery.
Will such a "return to physical" growth of the economy applications? Not at all, - consider the authors of the report.
India has become the leader in terms of the number of app downloads: it accounts for around 20% of all downloads.
These are followed by the USA (9%) and Brazil (8%).
iOS users, as well as before, spent more than Android users: on iOS 65% of all expenses in applications.
Among the applications, the video editor CapCut took first place in terms of the number of downloads in 2021.
Two Indian applications follow it: video service MX TakaTak and an online trading application Meesho.
Telegram is also in the top 10 by the number of downloads.
In general, based on the number of downloads, VPN services (two of which - VPN Master and NightOwl VPN - made it into the top 10) and video creation and streaming services (apart from CapCut and MX TakaTak, another two of which - Moj and SnackVideo - made it into the top 10) are popular among users.
The heaviest spenders were on live streaming and online streaming apps, said the report's authors.
Leading the way is YouTube, with the top five also including streaming services TikTok, Disney+ and HBO Max, as well as Japanese manga subscription service Piccoma.
The first places by the number of monthly active users are taken by Telegram, Instagram, Zoom and TikTok, with Microsoft Office mobile version closing the top 5.
In Russia, the leader in terms of the number of downloads for the year turned out to be shopping application AliExpress.
Behind it is the Zenly service, which shows the location of friends, and all the same CapCut.
Also in the top 10 were the online karaoke app StarMaker, online clothing retailer Shein, the Maps for Minecraft PE app, online taxi ordering service Didi, the YouTube Pure Tuber client, the Dixy retailer app and the online shoe store Cat.
People all over the world have adapted to the pandemic by going mobile, which is one of the main conclusions.
The areas that have seen the most success are those that help people connect virtually and in person," said Lexi Sidow, chief research officer at App Annie, commenting on the report.
The mobile games revenue reached $9 billion in 2021. The leaders by number of downloads were casual and hyper-casual games, in which there is no or almost no plot, and the video format is minimal.
Count Masters, Project Makeover and Bridge Race have made the top three most popular games in the world.
In Russia, the most popular games are DOP 2: Delete One Part, Going Balls and Phone Case DIY.
Earlier, App Annie presented its forecast for 2022.
Among the key trends for next year, analysts cited the growth of TikTok users to 1.5 billion, the rise in popularity of financial apps for Generation Z, such as investment app Robinhood, and further growth in the popularity of metaverse mobile games.

Russians warned about a new swindle
Scammers are looking for new ways to manipulate video messages.
This is reported by "News" with reference to experts.
According to Ivideon's director of products, Zaur Abutalimov, the main danger associated with the spread of video communication tools is diphtheria.
In this case, fraudsters create a fake video based on real recordings with the participation of the victim.
Thanks to this neural network it is possible to precisely reproduce the features of someone's behaviour.
Abitalimov added that using the deepfake technology, scammers could call the victim's relatives on video link or create a video with the participation of a copy of a person to blackmail.
Such hoaxes can provoke panic because the malicious perpetrator can place people in ridiculous, dangerous or compromising pseudo-scenarios, said the expert.
Varonis lead systems engineer Alexander Vetokh also noted that psychologically people are more likely to trust others when they can see them.
He stressed that this could create specific risks in case of technology using video.

Five actions to avoid diabetes
Problems with blood sugar levels - one of the most common in the world.
However, some do not attach great importance to this, and that's a mistake.
Diabetes can eventually lead to serious complications and even death.
Preventive measures play a key role in preventing the formation of diseases.
Thus, doctors recommend changing the drinking regime - reducing the variety of drinks and switching to plain water positively affects the metabolism.
Sweet products raise blood sugar levels to dangerous indicators when consumed in excess.
Therefore, the first step on the path to a healthy lifestyle is to stop buying sweets and storing them at home.
The appearance of the disease is influenced not only by improper nutrition, but also by habits.
To reduce the risk of diabetes, you need to move a lot.
Experts recommend a low-carb diet.
Such a diet will not only help reduce weight, but also protect against sharp fluctuations in sugar levels.
To protect against getting diabetes it is necessary to eat a lot of carrots.
Fiber fills the stomach and thus contributes to the feeling of satiety, the secretion of digestive juices and the absorption of food.

Dr Pavlova spoke about "migraines on the weekend" among workaholics
Several factors can contribute to a deterioration in self-esteem over the weekend.
The reason for the deterioration of self-feel after a working week is often "weekend migraine", according to famous endocrinologist, candidate of medical sciences, senior scientific collaborator of the Faculty of Fundamental Medicine at MGU, scientific head of the System Medicine Clinic Zukhra Pavlova in her telegram channel.
According to her, those most affected are workaholics, of whom suffer headaches, exhaustion and weakness at the weekends.
Dr. Pavlova noted that in addition to accumulated fatigue, there are enough objective reasons for the negative reaction of the organism to changes in conditions.
Our weekends are a fundamental change in our lives.
We drink a lot, lie on the couch all day, probably eat more and drink less, the doctor argued. A small break starts because of the lack of coffee.
Due to overeating and lack of water - heaviness and brokenness."
A additional role is played by late surge.
So if you stand up three hours later than usual, there will be a reaction, which is called a jet lag.
It affects travellers crossing several time zones.
To determine which of these factors plays a decisive role in the deterioration of self-esteem, Pavlova recommended tracking what changes the most on weekends.

South African scientists have claimed low efficacy of Pfizer's vaccine against "omicroon"
South Africa says Pfizer's vaccine against "the microbe" is ineffective
Scientists from the South African Republic conducted a study and reported low efficacy of the Pfizer vaccine against the omega strain of coronavirus infection.
According to estimates, it (the level of neutralization of "microons") corresponds to (the level of) efficacy of the vaccine against symptomatic infections by 22.5%, due to which... the ability of the vaccine to protect against infection is called into question, - it is said in the text of the study published on the MedRxiv portal.
At the same time experts specified that the preparation may save from a severe course of the disease.
Earlier, the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine predicted that the omega strain of the coronavirus could trigger a new wave of pandemic in Britain with more hospitalizations than last year.
How much hidden sugar in everyday products?
Sugar - not the best source of useful nutrients.
Its excess in the diet can lead to type 2 diabetes as well as cardiovascular and oncological diseases.
Consumers should bear in mind that an unfamiliar word in a product name may indicate hidden sugar - an ingredient similar to sugar in terms of calories, composition and glycemic index.
The label might contain several dozen names that, in essence, indicate sugar.
Some of the most common and frequently encountered names - glucose and fructose.
Other refined sugars include dextrose (corn sugar), levulose (fruit sugar), maltose (malt sugar), honey and so on.
These are all simple carbohydrates, which are mono- and disaccharides, and they may be not only in confectionery, but also in ketchup, in doctor's loaf, bread and etc.
As stated by Roskachestvo, the most effective way to reduce sugar consumption is to use whole and unprocessed foods, as well as to pay attention to the label and the many different names for sugar.
Different types of sugar are distinguished by taste, but regardless of how the ingredient is called - syrup or nectar, processed or unprocessed, brown or white, it is still sugar.
Counting the exact amount of sugar is not easy, as it is necessary to take not only the amount of sugar specified by the manufacturer on the packaging, but also the fact that vegetables, fruits and etc. initially contain a certain amount of sugar.
As a result, the total amount of sugar may be significantly higher than that shown on the label.
German Chancellor Scholz: Gas will lose importance for Germany in 25 years
The new German Chancellor, Olaf Scholz, stated that the import of gas is becoming less important for Germany as the country continues its transition to decarbonization of the economy.
According to him, Germany is planning to completely refuse gas, oil and coal by 2045, becoming a climate-neutral country.
This means that in 25 years' time the question of transporting gas to Germany and Europe will play a different role, he said.
Scholz noted that Germany continues to be committed to ensuring that Ukraine transports Russian natural gas in the future, as this resource is currently important for the country's energy transition.
He recalled that Germany and the United States made a statement in which Berlin's support for the energy transformation of Ukraine was fixed.
Earlier, the German Minister of Foreign Affairs, Annalena Berbock, stated that the process of certifying the "Nord Stream - 2" gas pipeline is ongoing.
According to the minister, during the coalition negotiations and the discussion of the coalition agreement, it was stated that European energy law should be applied to energy projects.
The diplomat also said that the pipeline "does not comply with EU requirements" so far.

Hackers have broken into the Twitter account of the Indian prime minister
Hackers have broken into the Twitter account of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
The perpetrators managed to publish a false message.
It was reported that India recognizes Bitcoin as a legal means of payment and that the country has already purchased cryptocurrency.
Modi's office asked them to ignore the new messages.
Representatives of the premier said that Twitter had responded quickly - access to the account had been restored.
The Indian premier's page was hacked in 2020 and donations to the fund were solicited using cryptocurrency.
In the referendum in New Caledonia the majority voted against independence
A third referendum in New Caledonia on December 12 delivered the same result as the previous two.
According to the first partial results announced on Sunday December 12 at midday, the majority of New Caledonia's residents voted against independence for their territory in the referendum.
However, turnout in the third vote was significantly lower than in the previous two.
According to preliminary results published by local authorities, 3.51 percent (2,755 people) voted in favor of New Caledonia becoming independent of France, while 96.49 percent (75,762) voted against it.
The turnout was 43.90%, with more than 80,000 people taking part in the election in New Caledonia.
As the French news agency France-Presse comments, "the outcome of these elections left no room for doubt", as supporters of independence urged voters not to take part in the vote.
As initiators of the referendum, they spoke out against the December 12 poll, saying a new outbreak of COVID-19 on the archipelago would make it impossible to hold a proper and "clean" campaign.
The absence opened the way to a third victory for supporters of French New Caledonia after referendums in November 2018 and October 2020.
In 2018, 56.7% of the population voted against independence, while in 2020 the figure was 53.3%.
As stated by separatists, they do not recognize the results of the last election and will challenge them in the UN.
French President Emmanuel Macron was to speak Sunday, Dec. 12, at the Elysee Palace about the results of the referendum.
The issue of New Caledonia's independence has livened up the final days of the French presidential election campaign.
Several candidates for president have spoken in favor of the territory remaining part of France because it is "the last region of presence of the European Union in the Pacific".
New Caledonia must remain French, Eric Zemmour repeated on several occasions.
The same claim was made by Republican candidate Valerie Pecresse, who at the end of October published a column in Le Figaro calling on Calaisiens to remain French.
For his part, Emmanuel Macron declared in May 2018 that he would not take a position, "because it is not his responsibility".
However, the President added: "France would be less beautiful without New Caledonia."
Prime Minister Jean Castaner, for his part, expressed "a strong desire for the choice of Calaisiens to be a choice for France".
Hey, hi there!
I didn't do much for you... I kissed you many times, and I'm still embarrassed and ashamed.

First laser weaponry drone tested in Turkey
The first laser weapon drone in the world has successfully passed tests in Turkey.
The UAV "Eren" was tested at distances ranging from 100 to 500 meters, according to "MIR24".
The device is capable of neutralizing explosive objects remotely using a laser.

WSJ readers criticize article on Russia-US relations
Readers of The Wall Street Journal have criticised an article by Professor Christopher Hartwell in which he described his vision of relations between Russia and the US.
The author of the material expressed concern that the West allegedly sacrifices Ukraine to Russia.
In his article he convinces readers of the dangers that emanate from Moscow and allowed a series of offensive remarks in relation to Russian President Vladimir Putin.
At the end Hartwell called on Western countries "to act as a united front against Russia".
Readers of The Wall Street Journal expressed their disagreement with the position of an American professor.
There is a lot of false information in this article, one reader comments to RIA Novosti.
Europe is not ours to lose, and Ukraine is not our land.
The United States and its NATO allies will never go to a nuclear war with Russia over Ukraine," he said.

It is noted that the epicenter of the earthquake was located 231.8 km northeast of the city of Severo-Kurilsk.
The fire lay at a depth of 92.5 km.
Seismologists had earlier recorded a 7.5 magnitude earthquake in Peru which left ten people injured.

Ukraine to start producing new-generation reactionless drones
A new Ukrainian-Turkish plant will start creating reactionless unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) of the ANKA type.
This was reported by non-staff adviser to the head of the Ukrainian President's Office, Alexei Arestovich, on December 11.
So they are able to act against air targets, against other drones.
Even against piloted aviation.
They will be equipped with Ukrainian engines and the rest of the Turkish avionics: the body and so on," he quoted Dialogs.ua.
Commenting on the main features of the ANKA system, Arestovic said that it is a question of a reactive, rather than a piston-type UAV.
According to him, this new generation of drones after Bayraktar, surpasses it "in all characteristics".
The first batch of drones should be produced by the factory at the end of next year, Arestovic concluded.
The Anka unmanned aerial vehicle was developed by the Turkish Aerospace Industries in February 2014.
Development of the drone was carried out by the Turkish authorities in collaboration with a number of private companies since 2010.
Yesterday, the Ukrainian General Staff classified data on the use of Bayraktar and Javelin missile complexes during the military operations of the combined forces in Donbass.
On December 6, Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky announced that the construction of a factory to produce modern military drones had begun in the country.
According to him, Ukraine intends to use drones.
On September 29, Bayraktar Savunma and the Ukrainian Defense Ministry signed an agreement on the construction of a center in the Kiev region, where the personnel will be trained, as well as tests and maintenance of Turkish UAV Bayraktar.
The press service of the Ukrainian leader's office called the move a "big step forward."
Two lions escape from container at airport
Lions have escaped at Singapore airport.
This was reported by The Straits Times.
Two predators managed to get out of the container with seven lions, arriving on one of the planes.
The publication notes that it is not known from what country they were brought to Singapore, or where they were headed.
One of the loose lions climbed onto the container roof.
The animals were unable to move away from it due to a number of protective fences being in place.
The standoff ended when staff from wildlife group Mandai Parks, which manages all Singapore's zoos, arrived at the airport.
They anesthetized the lions with tranquilizers and plan to deliver them to a quarantine facility.
It was reported earlier that a lion had escaped from its owner and was roaming the streets of Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia.
The animal returned home voluntarily on the same day and no one was injured.
Experts have warned of the cancer risk from vitamin B9
Research suggests that too much of vitamin B9, also known as folic acid, may increase the risk of cancer.
This was reported by Daily Express.
According to experts, there is evidence that people without a deficiency of folic acid are less likely to suffer certain types of cancer, in particular colon.
However, exceeding the necessary dose stimulates the growth of cancer cells.
A professor of nutrition at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, Beth Kitchin, advises keeping track of the amount of folic acid taken in daily.
The optimal dose is 400 micrograms a day.
The risk of cancer only increases if the figure is significantly exceeded in either direction.
Kitschin recommends against taking vitamin B9 in tablets without a doctor's recommendation, to monitor the dosage and avoid talcum powder and other food products that contain folic acid.
Previously, nutrition consultant Rachel Fine called folic acid a substance that slows aging.
As it contains avocado among other things, Fine recommended men over 50 should eat more of the fruit.
In UK up to 75,000 could die from Omega strain by April
Predictions from British scientists suggest that up to 75,000 people could die in England over the next five months alone if restrictions are not tightened during the winter.
This was reported by The Guardian newspaper, citing a study by experts from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), TASS reports.
According to the most optimistic forecast of experts, who are members of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies at the British Cabinet Office, by April 2022 at least 25,000 deaths in the country will be recorded due to the Omega strain, with around 175,000 patients hospitalized in total.
At the height of the outbreak, hospitals will be receiving up to 2,000 infected people daily.
Serious measures to combat the coronavirus may be needed to avoid overwhelming the NHS if the omega strain turns out to be more infectious than the delta variant and existing vaccines do not prevent infection, according to mathematician Rosalind Barratt of LSHTM.
Earlier, the British Health Protection Agency warned that if the spread of the omega strain continues at the current rate, about 100,000 cases will be identified in the country by the end of the year.
By then, by mid-December, the strain of omega could be the dominant one in the United Kingdom.
There are now 1,898 cases of the omega strain of the coronavirus in the UK, with 633 of those diagnosed in the last 24 hours.
Meanwhile, on December 9, the head of the British Ministry of Health Sajid Javid said that in reality this figure could already reach 10,000 cases.

The number of superyachts in the world has grown by a quarter
Construction of superyachts this year and orders for next year are hitting all-time highs around the world despite calls to reduce carbon footprints and combat climate change.
In the global register of courts, the number of ordered yachts amounted to 1,200 units - a quarter more than last year.
In the era of fighting climate change, it is hard to imagine that the number of people who want and have the money for a floating fortress priced at over 50 million pounds will not decrease, writes The Guardian.
Their number is growing, though.
Orders this year were 25% higher than the previous year.
Brokers say such a frenzy in the market hasn't been seen in two decades.
The first reason is that many who can afford a yacht fear becoming infected on land and prefer to hide from the pandemic on their own vessel.
The second reason is also connected with the coronavirus.
Previously, all these people went to the office and met with business partners personally, but now, the absolute majority of them work remotely and communicate via video conferencing.
Broker Will Christie told the paper that shipyards are already booking orders for new yachts into 2025 and beyond.
It means that customers are willing to pay more just to get their yacht sooner, even if it's just by a year or two.
People just want freedom, and the super-rich could allow themselves that, he says.
In Western society, many criticise such behaviour in the rich and call it decadent.
The rich, sociologists say, don't want to understand that in times of scarcity, traveling to space, living on yachts or flying in private planes, are considered provocative by society, since the elite does not want to share responsibility for climate change with the rest of humanity.
Economists are calling for action and suggesting new taxes and rules for the super-rich, though they know it would be extremely difficult to do given the mobility of money.
Meanwhile, the number of superyachts ordered is impressive, as is their size.
Of the 1200 ships, 27 have a length of over 100 meters.
Norwegian billionaire building 183m superyacht REV Ocean
When launched, it will be the largest yacht in the world.
The yacht comes with a "moon pool", as well as a submarine designed for underwater exploration.
Helipads, open-air cinemas, boxing rings on some of the existing superyachts - and Professor Richard Wilkinson, an economic anthropologist from Indiana University, says compared to the total amount of carbon emissions, the carbon footprint of the super-rich is insignificant.
But it is symbolic if you consider that there are slightly more than 2000 millionaires in the world.
This is just another example of the overuse of a very small group of people.
Scientists have found that the carbon footprint of millionaires is thousands of times larger than that of the average person on the planet.
If one person produces an average of 5 tonnes of CO2 a year, then the biggest polluter of the planet Roman Abramovich is responsible for 33.9 tonnes of greenhouse gases that entered the atmosphere in 2018.
Two-thirds of his emissions allowance went on his 162.5-metre yacht, Eclipse.
Even if the owner of the yacht is not on board, the crew continues to poison the planet.
The owner can call the captain and give the order to sail the yacht, for example, from the Mediterranean to the Caribbean.
Superyacht owners do not win the sympathy of others when they, like Australia's richest woman Gina Rinehart, who owns mines on the continent, complain via YouTube that there is no berth for their giant yachts.
It is also hard to understand her call to build marinas for yachts over 50 meters.
A dangerous weekly alcohol limit that can lead to bowel cancer has been identified
US scientists have determined how much alcohol increases the risk of developing cancer.
This is reported by Daily Express.
Experts have concluded that the consumption of four or more portions of alcoholic beverages per week is associated with an increased risk of developing oncology.
The likelihood of developing the disease increases with the amount of alcohol consumed.
And moderate drinkers are at higher risk than women.
Scientists cannot determine the exact cause of the development of such cancer, noting only certain factors that lead to a harmful process for the body.

Dogs can understand words and phrases at the level of a two-year-old child
Many - in fact, all - dog lovers are convinced that these creatures are very intelligent.
And even they cannot imagine just how developed their four-legged pets really are.
For many years, biologists have conducted various experiments to determine unequivocally how developed the intelligence of animals is.
Though a dog's vocabulary is not as extensive as a human's, new research reveals that they can understand 89 words or phrases in sequence.
The research was published in the journal Sciencealert.
Dogs cannot play chess or compose poetry, they do not understand politics, economics and art, but they often manage to deceive their owners.
Representatives of some breeds, experts say, show better results in understanding human language but there's not enough data for definitive conclusions.
Thus, some breeds are traditionally considered canine geniuses - for example, labradors.
Experts have concluded that dogs are capable of logical thinking and are as trainable as a two-year-old child.

Ukraine is preparing to trade with the US and Russia
The US and Russia will "bargain" on the issue of Ukraine's accession to NATO, analyst Alexander Kokotov said in his article for the publication "Glavred".
According to him, Washington and Moscow plan to continue negotiations on the US guarantee that Ukraine will not join the North Atlantic Alliance in the near future, despite the words of the American leader Joe Biden about the right of countries "to go wherever they want".
If someone offers you something manifestly unacceptable, for example, to sell a close relative into sexual slavery, you won't haggle, but just report the proposer.
And as for Ukraine, it is "a trade" - wrote the analyst.
Kochetkov added that Russia has no plans to attack Ukraine and is striving for dialogue with Kiev.
They prepare secretly, quickly and immediately switch to offensive actions, rather than wait for the group to be detected and counter-measures to be deployed, he noted.
China stimulates the development of the railway transportation industry
Advanced Chinese technologies attracted the attention of companies from the United States, Germany, France and other countries at the 2021 China International Rail Transportation and Production Equipment Exhibition held in the city of Chuzhou, Hunan Province, Central China.
The main technology developed by CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co. Ltd. allows trains to automatically detect and diagnose technical failures, said the company's spokesman Hou Zhaowen.
High-speed trains running on the China-Laos railway, which began operation at the beginning of this month, are equipped with the technology, which will enhance the reliability and maintainability of the rolling stock.
In the last six months, China has significantly increased its exports of railway transport vehicles, and many countries in Asia and Europe have become witnesses of "China's speed".
In May this year, the first in China two-story high-speed electric train, designed for export to Europe, was produced by CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co., Ltd.
With a maximum operating speed of 200 kilometers per hour, these trains will run on the railways of Austria, Germany, Hungary and other European countries.
In November, the metro train designed by the aforementioned company for Turkey began trial operations.
The train will run along a metro line linking the centre of Istanbul with the city's airport.
The metro line will open next year.
It will be the fastest metro line in Turkey with a speed of 120 kilometers per hour.
China's railway equipment manufacturing industry is one of the sectors with the highest level of innovation and the strongest international innovation competitiveness, said Fan Yaoyan, head of the Trade and Investment Department of the China Committee for the Promotion of International Trade (CCPIT).
This sector accounts for China’s main competitive advantage in the global market of high-end equipment, said Fan Yaoyan.
After more than 60 years of intensive work, China has developed a leading production equipment system for railway transportation, with a complete set of supporting means and large-scale production activities.
According to Fan Yaoqiang, the country ranked first in the level of electrification of railways and the operational distance of high-speed and urban railways.
Biologist lists early signs of dementia
Candidate of Biological Sciences Semen Goloshekin listed the first signs of dementia in a conversation with Radio Sputnik.
According to him, the signs of future dementia may be forgetfulness, as well as a whole range of moderate cognitive impairments, such as inability to concentrate, plan, abstract thinking level.
There is currently debate about whether hearing loss may be an early sign of Alzheimer's disease or a risk factor for its development, he said.
Goloshekin emphasized that the causes of dementia may be neurodegenerative disorders, head injuries, some infections, metabolic disorders, and a lack of certain vitamins.
He added that Alzheimer's and atherosclerosis of the cerebral vessels are the most common causes of this syndrome.
A biologist noted that to this day doctors do not know effective ways to treat dementia.
This is why it is necessary to start its prevention in time.
According to him, studying foreign languages and keeping socially active helps reduce the risk of developing dementia.
WHO also recommends maintaining a moderate level of physical activity, regularly training cognitive skills through games and hobbies that require intensive memory and logic thinking.
There are recommendations for the use of various BADs, but their effectiveness and feasibility are still discussed in the scientific community, said Gologochekin.
The World Health Organization recommends maintaining a moderate level of physical activity, regular training of cognitive skills and abilities with the help of games and hobbies that require intense memory and logic, Gologochev said.
Earlier this year, a British charity said that dementia was becoming more common in people under 40.
Doctors called the early signs of Alzheimer's disease.
The first sign of concern is problems with vision, as a result of which the patient has difficulty recognizing objects.
Another sign of developing dementia cited by experts is aphasia - a condition where a person struggles to find the right words to communicate what they are thinking.
A neurologist has demanded that Saakashvili be sent for treatment abroad.
Georgia's former president Mikhail Saakashvili needs psychotherapy and rehabilitation abroad, neurosurgeon Otar Toidze, who is part of a consortium of doctors set up by Georgia's ombudsman, told journalists.
His neurological status is the leading cause of his illness.
The stable problems are the problems of movement, coordination, change of character," the expert said, noting that this was beyond the norm and that the ex-president needed to be sent for special rehabilitation now.
This is what we call neuro-reabilitation and psychoneuro-reabilitation, the possibility of which we did not find in Georgia," Toidze said, demanding that Saakashvili be treated in a special institution which Georgia does not have.
On the evening of December 7, Saakashvili began to obstruct the obtaining of medical assistance after the staff of the penitentiary service subjected him to disciplinary punishment.
The Georgian politician was quick to have the punishment lifted and his old rights restored.

Protests against COVID passports take place in Spain
Protests against mandatory vaccination certificates took place in Spanish cities Barcelona and Valencia, Europa Press reports.
In the Catalan capital, the number of participants in the rally amounted to around 30,000 people.
In Barcelona, COVID passes became compulsory for going to bars, restaurants, gyms, retirement homes and nighttime entertainment venues.
Many protesters came to the rally without masks.
On their banners they accused the state of totalitarianism and called for respect for citizens' choices.
In Valencia, passports are also required for entry into entertainment venues and restaurants with a capacity of more than 50 people.
Protesters in that city decried a "medical dictatorship," calling the vaccinations an experiment.
More than 520,000 cases of infection with the coronavirus have been identified in Spain since the start of the pandemic, with more than 88,000 patients dying.
Restrictions for the unvaccinated are also planned in Russia.
The government submitted draft laws on a single system of QR codes to the State Duma on November 12.
It is assumed that Russians will be able to visit places where mass events, cultural institutions, objects of public catering and retail trade are held by presenting either a certificate of vaccination or a medical note on vaccination.
Such rules will be established for trips by trains and planes too.

Tough climb: how the Chinese become skiers
The Olympics should attract millions of people and help create world-class resorts in the country
In China, it is hoped that the Olympics will not only attract 30 million citizens to take part in winter sports and help raise the 1 trillion yuan targeted by President Xi Jinping, but also help the economic development of the underdeveloped and remote provinces.
The ski resort of Taizhou in Zhangjiakou, located not far from the site of the Winter Olympics, has become increasingly popular among Chinese people.
In addition to constructing infrastructure in the region, work is also underway to green the area: workers are planting trees.
The country has more than 700 ski resorts, but only 20 of them are large enough to host international competitions.
In many regions of China, where the resorts are located, including in Zhangjiakou, there are problems with snow.
The main task for the long term is to ensure comfortable and interesting holidays in Chinese resorts so that all newcomers become regulars.
However, this is still far away.
Adviser to the organizers of the Games Justin Downs says that since his last visit in 2007, the Chinese ski industry had changed beyond recognition.
More and more Chinese people are moving to the slopes every winter.
Fiona, a snowboarder from Beijing, is one of them.
Despite serious changes, it will still take many years to create a ski culture here, Downs believes.
Many resorts are located in agricultural and mining areas.
These regions need to be actively developed and the necessary infrastructure for rest and recreation needs to be created there.
The 70-year-old Gao Mankang lives in Chunli, not far from the site of the Winter Olympic Games.
He notes that in recent years there has been a boom in winter sports tourism here.
Two years ago, a high-speed rail line was built from Beijing to Chongli, and now not a single local resident is unemployed.
In the country more and more stores are opening that sell clothing and equipment for winter sports.
Food stalls offering dishes of the national cuisine will appear on the slopes.
Taiwan now has a COVID-19 testing station.
China aims to create a thriving winter sports industry, with its athletes becoming leaders in major international competitions, and its resorts and facilities reaching world class.
More than 500 million people worldwide could fall into extreme poverty because of the pandemic, the World Health Organization said.
More than 500 million people worldwide could be plunged into extreme poverty because of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has stalled progress towards universal health coverage, the World Health Organization (WHO) and World Bank (WB) said.
In connection with the celebration of the World Health Organization (WHO) and World Bank (WB) International Coverage Day on December 12, two complementary reports were published.
In them, they stated that the pandemic had led to disruptions in healthcare services and had caused excessive strain on healthcare systems.
As a result, immunization coverage among the population decreased for the first time in 10 years, and mortality rates from tuberculosis and malaria increased.
The WHO and the World Bank have stressed that the pandemic has caused the worst economic crisis since the 1930s, making it harder for people to pay for healthcare.
The situation pushes more than 500 million people "to the extreme poverty, because they have to pay for these services from their pockets".
In October, UN Secretary-General António Guterres stated that the COVID-19 pandemic had plunged more than 100 million people into poverty, with over four billion people practically lacking social protection.

Reuters: Taiwan minister's speech at 'Democracy Summit' cut off on White House request
A speech by Taiwan's Minister of Digital Technology Audrey Tang at a panel discussion during the U.S.-organized "Summit on Democracy" was cut off without video, according to a recording of the summit on YouTube.
Reuters reported, citing sources, that the picture was turned off at the request of the White House.
It cited a map used by the airline that showed Taiwan as a separate territory from China.
The map that Ms Tan was showing was compiled by South Africa-based non-governmental organisation CIVICUS and rated countries across the world in terms of the extent to which civil rights are fulfilled.
Taiwan was marked in green as "free", while China, North Korea, Laos and Vietnam were marked in red as "closed".
After the minister showed the map, a graphic on her side of the screen was replaced by a slide noting that the views expressed in the discussion "do not necessarily reflect the position of the U.S. government."
China was not invited to the "Summit for Democracy".
The sources of Reuters note that the map demonstrated by the Taiwanese minister could contradict the policy of "one China", which is adhered to by Washington.
A source familiar with the matter said that after the map was shown, the U.S. National Security Council got angry at the State Department, accusing it of treating Taiwan as a separate country.
The "Summit for Democracy" organized by Washington from December 9 to 10 was attended by representatives from 110 countries and territories, as well as civil society and charitable organizations.
Russia was not invited to the summit.
At the "Zero Day" summit, Nobel Peace Prize laureate and Novaya Gazeta editor-in-chief Dmitry Muratov called for the creation of an international foundation through which money obtained by corruption would be donated to charity.
Earlier today, the Deputy Secretary of the Russian Federation's Security Council Yury Averianov stated that the summit had an "anti-Russian and anti-Chinese charge".

Not all in one go - bad people may be, you may have a claim against them on a specific pretext...
But where is the number of children, age, pension fund and other things?
Write that they are "thieves, who did not return the money".
Well, how many and when will they have children, it's not your business until they string these children up around your neck.
If this is excluded, what right do you have to condemn them?
Well, that's just how education is...
Chosen (by themselves) parents dictate their own rules, openly violating existing ones.
And if this will concern other spheres of life, judicial proceedings and so on?
For them laws are not written.
And if the Pope does introduce his method of education and upbringing?
What a terrible example for others, indeed.

China strengthens the prevention and control of the epidemic of COVID-19 in cities where there are land passages
A joint mechanism for prevention and control of the State Council of the PRC issued a circular requiring to strengthen prevention and control of the epidemic of COVID-19 in cities with land customs ports in order to further prevent the importation of the infection across the border.
According to the circular, people leaving the specified cities must provide a negative result of the COVID-19 nucleic acid test taken within 48 hours of departure.
Anyone arriving in cities that have land border crossings must undergo at least one test for nucleic acid COVID-19 upon arrival.
The document says the requirements will apply from the date the relevant provincial level administrative units designate and publish the zones of the cities concerned until March 15, 2022.
In addition, it is noted that cities with land border crossings that meet certain criteria may consider establishing buffer zones for the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic within their jurisdiction.

Foreign Ministry spokesman on "painful conclusions" in relations between Russia and the US
Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov has assessed the prospects for relations between Moscow and Washington in an interview with Izvestia.
He noted that a long path of interaction has led to sad conclusions, and problems between the two countries did not begin yesterday.
One-sided negative predictability exists, but as for the prospects for improving relations, they are completely unpredictable.
It's a sad conclusion to a long journey that we've taken with this administration, with Trump, with Obama.
The problems did not begin yesterday," the diplomat noted.
According to Ryabkov, the problems are connected with the US desire to impose solutions on Russia on a number of issues.
The foreign minister added that he would not give optimistic forecasts about the prospects for improving relations and did not expect a change in Washington's position.
He explained that with the exception of strategic stability and cybersecurity, progress is not observed.
At the same time, Russia calls on the United States to be responsible in matters of international security and hopes that the signals will be heard and that Americans will listen to the arguments of common sense.
Earlier, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov stated during a meeting with US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken that Moscow is ready to restore dialogue with the United States.
Virologist warns of the danger of nasal spray vaccine from COVID outside hospitals
Allergies to the nasal spray vaccine against COVID-19 may occur and those vaccinated may require medical assistance, therefore, the first points for vaccination with this preparation should not be organized in airports and shopping centers.
This was reported by TASS virologist, corresponding member of the Russian Academy of Sciences, head of the laboratory of biotechnology, microbiology and virology of the Novosibirsk State University Sergei Netessov.
It is easier to organise vaccination points for the nasal vaccine in airports and shopping centres, but I would only do this at the outset in medical establishments.
The point is that the likelihood of an allergic reaction to such a vaccine is small, but it's better for a person to sit in the doctor's office afterward.
Doctors have special sets of anti-allergic drugs that work within a minute or two, sometimes that is very necessary," Netesov said.
A virologist said that it would be possible to consider vaccination in shopping centers when there is experience of using the preparation.
He also stressed that when using the nasal spray vaccine it is important that it reaches the mucous membrane in the nasal cavity.
There is a chance the vaccine will not reach its intended location if the person being vaccinated sneezes after the spray.

Serbia has produced 2 million doses of the "Sputnik V" vaccine
The most popular vaccine in Serbia is "Sputnik V".
Serbia has produced around 2 million doses of the Russian "Sputnik V" vaccine, the country's Minister of Innovation and Technological Development, Nenad Popovic, told TASS.
So far, about 2 million doses of the "Sputnik V" vaccine have been produced at the state institution of Torlak, and we expect that at least 4 million will be produced in the coming period," Popovic said.
According to him, the Russian vaccine is the most popular among the Serbs.
To this end, the republic is planning to buy an additional million doses of the vaccine from Russia.
The Serbian Minister of Innovation and Technological Development also expressed interest in producing the "Sputnik V" and "Sputnik Light" nasal vaccine in the country.
Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin said that Russia has sent nearly two million doses of the domestic "Sputnik V" vaccine to Serbia.

1239 cases of the omega strain of coronavirus were recorded in the UK in a day - RT in Russian
1,239 cases of the new Omega strain of coronavirus were identified in the UK in a day.
This was reported by Sky News.
In particular, 1196 new cases of the "omega" strain were recorded in England, 38 people fell ill with a new strain in Scotland and five in Northern Ireland.
The total number of Covid-19 cases in the new strain in the UK is now 3,137.
Earlier, scientists from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine predicted in a pessimistic scenario that 75,000 people may die in England by April due to an outbreak of the coronavirus caused by the "omicron" strain.
Peskov warned of the suffering of Western countries that introduce anti-Russian sanctions
The press secretary of the Russian president, Dmitry Peskov, has commented on the possible introduction of anti-Russian sanctions in the event of the continuation of "aggressive actions" against Ukraine, including an alleged "invasion" of the country's territory.
It is impossible to introduce any restrictions against Russia without suffering damage oneself," the official representative of the Kremlin stated on the air of the Rossiya 1 television channel.
Peskov asserted that this was "understood by everyone in the world."
It was earlier reported that the US is looking at the possibility of introducing anti-Russian sanctions in the energy sector as an extreme measure.
In addition, Washington and the EU are planning to introduce restrictions that will complicate the conversion of rubles into dollars for Russian banks and the Russian Direct Investment Fund.
At the same time, the head of Sberbank, German Gref, is sure that this is impossible.

New Caledonia residents reject independence from France
According to the final results of the third independence referendum in New Caledonia, the vast majority of participants refused to leave France.
This was reported by French television channel BFM.TV on December 12.
96.5% voted against independence.
3.51% of the population of the archipelago in the South Pacific supported independence from France.
Annulled the results of 2.99% of ballots.
Voter turnout in the referendum was very low: around 55% of the archipelago's population went to the polls.
According to experts, the low turnout is explained by separatists calling for a boycott of the referendum due to the coronavirus.
Paris has refused to postpone the date of the referendum.
In October 2020, residents of New Caledonia voted against independence from France in a referendum.
A referendum on independence was held in the region in 2018.
The majority of inhabitants support the archipelago remaining part of France.
New Caledonia is located almost 20,000 kilometers from mainland France.
In 1853, France declared New Caledonia as its possession.
The archipelago is home to around 270,000 people and has a special administrative status.
An agreement between Paris and the New Caledonia administration dating back to 1998 allows the region to hold two votes on its independence every two years.

WHO preliminarily considers "omicron" less dangerous than "delta"
The World Health Organization (WHO) has provisionally classed "omicron" as less dangerous than the "delta" strain of coronavirus.
There is data that shows a drop in the effectiveness of vaccines against a new variant of COVID-19.
According to information for December 9, "omir" is registered in 63 countries.
Preliminary data and a significantly altered antigenic profile of the Omega strain suggest that the effectiveness of the vaccine against infection and transmission of the variant may be reduced.
According to preliminary data from South Africa, the severity of the disease ("heaviness of the infection") may be less than with "delta", - it is said in the technical message of WHO.
The organisation notes that all cases of infection with "omikron" in the EU to date have been mild or symptomless.
Meanwhile, the new strain, according to preliminary data, spreads faster than "delta".
Two cases of omega strain infection have been registered in Russia.
They had previously been immunized, the Gamaleya Center reported.
Head of Russia's consumer watchdog Anna Popova said there was no reliable data so far to suggest the new strain was less dangerous than others.

Four scenarios for Zelensky in Ukraine
Ex-deputy of the Supreme Council Vadim Denysenko listed four possible developments for President of Ukraine Vladimir Zelensky in 2022.
According to him, the head of state may remain without support from the West, and possibly make compromises on Donbass.
This was reported on Sunday 12 December by Denysenko on the website "Glavred".
The first scenario, which Denysenko called an "ideal storm," assumes that Ukraine will stop supporting key Western countries and reach an agreement on the future of the country without its participation.
Such a development of events will contribute to a deep crisis that Kiev may face in 2023.
There is a decrease in prices for key goods that we traditionally export <...> internal protests and confrontation with the authorities by key FPG (financial and industrial groups). - added the ex-MP.
According to Denisenko, there is another scenario for the development of the situation - "a war against all".
This forecast will come true in the event of high turbulence in global politics, when Ukrainian authorities will face a number of problems.
As a result, the Ukrainian leadership may make compromises on Donbass, which could lead to confrontation in the country.
By the end of the summer, Zelensky's position had weakened, with the likelihood of such a situation, according to the words of a former MP, amounting to 50-55%.
The third scenario for the development of the situation in Ukrainian politics - the confrontation of groups of population that are not in agreement with the Zelensky group and the President, as a result of which the capture of control over the power block and the realization of "populist initiatives" is likely.
In this scenario, Zelensky will start a "transformation of power," Denysenko added.
Another scenario - the transformation of Zelensky into a "father of the nation".
This may be due to some event that will be a major shock to society.
The event must be sufficient in scale so as not to go unnoticed by our foreign partners and to increase support for Ukraine," Denysenko said.
This scenario is possible as a result of a natural disaster, a technological catastrophe or aggressive actions by Russia, the former MP believes.
Meanwhile, the Russian side has already rejected any possibility of an "attack" on Ukraine.
It was noted in Moscow that it is the Ukrainian authorities, NATO and the United States that are increasing military activity near Russian borders.
Earlier, on November 11, data from a poll by the sociological group "Rating" showed that the rating of the Ukrainian President had fallen to a record low of 19.3%.
It is the lowest rating since he took office.
Analysts predicted a situation where, in the event of the nearest presidential election for Zelensky, 21.8% would vote for him, while 14.5% would vote for ex-president of the country Petro Poroshenko.
Only 19.3% of those questioned expressed support for the president.

Poet arrested for Red Square protest: "They give 10 days for a quotation from Yevtushenko, here it is, the power of poetry!"
A 21-year-old poet, Alexander Volchenkov, was arrested for ten days at the beginning of this week.
A VSE student was detained on Red Square with a placard with the hashtag #poetryrussiabetterthanpoetry.
The quote belongs to writer Yevgeny Yevtushenko.
A protocol was drawn up against Alexander on an administrative charge of repeat violation of the procedure for holding a public event.
He was detained for the first time on 23 January on Pushkin Square at a rally in support of Alexei Navalny.
The goal was to attract attention to poetry in general, unfortunately, interest in it has now declined, to the decline of culture in general in Russia and also a small hope to inspire unknown poets to write their verses under this hashtag on the Internet," Alexander said.
We got in touch with the young poet to establish the circumstances of his detention and to reveal in more detail the message of his poem.
How have police officers treated you on this and previous occasions?
What did the department ask you, when commenting on your action?
The officers were more correct this time, the detention was maximum, polite, as if it sounded ridiculous in some context of the word.
At Pushkinskaya they took OMONites and took them forcibly.
They asked the standard questions about motives.
When they heard about it, in principle, they looked at it with understanding, if not approval.
Everything was impeccably correct, apart from the monkey being blown in all directions, but I knew where this was going.
And if after the action under this hashtag start writing their poems, even a few people, I will not waste these 10 days.
Maxim, according to the protocol, spoke alone in the language of the Tumba-Yumba tribe.
At public and official events, they speak in the language of the surroundings so that everyone can understand what happened in the Bundestag on 25 September 2001, or in their native language through a translator.
This protocol and nothing more, incidentally, Angela Merkel speaks Russian perfectly and nevertheless resorts to the help of a interpreter.
And even at official events, a stenographer takes notes the old-fashioned way, with a pen, and a stenographer is not required to know several languages.
If you don't want to say many words, just say no!

Researchers reveal how potatoes can help fight age-related health problems
The study showed that potatoes are rich in vitamins and micro-elements, which contribute to the improvement of blood circulation and the reduction of cholesterol levels.
The root contains vitamins B group, vitamin C, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, riboflavin, folic and pantothenic acid.
All these elements help the systems in the body work.
In addition, the potato helps in the fight against age-related violations.
Thanks to its high content of caffeine, it is useful for the gastrointestinal tract, and regular use may also help in the prevention of hypertension and atherosclerosis.
However, for the root vegetable to be most beneficial, it is best to roast or boil it, rather than fry in oil.
Previous editions of The Daily Express have warned that potatoes can be dangerous for diabetics, just like other high-GI foods.
These are products containing carbohydrates that are rapidly broken down into sugars, such as sugar, sweet non-alcoholic beverages, white rice, and white bread.
At the beginning of December, the newspaper "Kommersant" warned of a possible shortage of Russian table potatoes, noting a reduction in their production in personal subsidiary farms and an increase in processing capacity.
According to market participants, the shortage of products can be covered only by imports at the moment.
Lostfilm, Lordfilm and other pirates will be removed from the "Yandex" release
Candidates for the exit
In 2015, the right holders from the "RAEC/Media" cluster compiled a list of 100 largest pirate websites on the Internet, and most of them have stopped their existence, said the director of the Institute of Internet Research Karen Kazaryan.
However, some - Kinogo, Lostfilm, Filmix - managed to survive thanks, among other things, to regular changes of the domain name, he added.
For example, on Lostfilm, which is available in the search results of both "Yandex" and Google, pirated copies of the Netflix series "Game of Thrones" and "Humans" director Anna Melikyan - the original series of the largest Russian video service ivi (part of AIV) - can be watched.
On Kinogo, which is also available to searchers, you can watch the animated novelty “Encanto”, but, judging by the quality of the video, it is a so-called screen (a pirated copy of the film made in the cinema).
On Filmix, which can also be found through search engines, the TV series "Univers. 10 years later" of the TNT channel (part of "Gazprom-media") is available.

An "atomic" or "molecular" design that reflects the essence and natural substance of each object is not losing its relevance and allows you to highlight the emphasis in the interior.
One of the characteristic features of such lamps is the lightness of the construction.
By means of thin, practically invisible cables, which are regulated by height, the impression is created that the chandelier is floating in the air.
Metallic gold framework and matte-white miniature plinths effortlessly complement any palette, while the suspended lamps and floor lamps in the collection are ready-made ensembles for lighting the living room, bedroom, and entrance hall.
Well, on taste and color, what is it called.
I really liked "Tarhun", not the current one, of course.
The juices in the bottles were very tasty.
3 portions of syrup - a ration, to my taste.
They were the best of friends.
Matras Dimax Micro Ultimate, size 160x190
Orthopedic spring mattress Micro Ultimate.
The model is convenient because it has two different surfaces in terms of hardness - high rigidity and slightly above average.
Only high-quality and premium fillers that have proven themselves in the best way possible were used in the product.
Springs: An independent spring "micro-package" is installed in the center of the model.
This means that each bed has 2000 spirals, which work autonomously.
It is their operation that provides unique point calibration.
Micropacket is the most high-frequency of all the variety of rubber blocks "Dimaks", so it has a pronounced orthopedic effect and is considered premium.
Fillers: Layers of coconut and natural rubber are combined in the top and bottom layers.
The only difference - is the order of tiles.
If one surface has latex on it, the other has coconut coir.
This type of filler has long been considered classic because it not only gives the mattress orthopedic but also anatomical properties.
If the corset provides the right support for the spine, then latex provides adaptation of the surface to the human body.
Case: the model is delivered in a protruding triangular cotton case with Aloe Vera.
It can be made portable or stationary, according to the client's wishes.
The overall height of the device – 27 cm, the recommended load on the sleeping place – 170 kg.
Warranty and Safety: Warranty period - 3 years.
The Matra received all the necessary certificates and documents confirming its full safety and reliability in operation.
The orthopedic pen that is used in the mattress has a CertiPUR certificate.
Estonian scientists will search for life on Venus
The Massachusetts Institute of Technology is preparing three space missions to Venus to search for signs of life in its atmosphere, in collaboration with the Tartu Observatory and other research institutions and companies, it was reported on Sunday by Actual Camera.
The goal of the launching mission is to assess the suitability of Venus clouds for life within five years and then search for life there.
Tartu scientists have proposed instruments for measuring the acidity and oxygen content in Venus clouds for the project.
It was previously thought that Venus' clouds, the closest planet to Earth, were too acidic to support life, but it is likely that Venus was originally an Earth-like planet.
A sample from Venus should arrive during the third mission.
Assuming that if we find life there, the main question will be - does it resemble Earth life or is it different.
If it is very similar, then it will be obvious that life on Earth did not begin on Earth.
If it is different, then it is probably more likely that life began on Earth," said the head of Estonia's "Venus Life Finder" project, Mikhel Paulus.

Metahumans will change Russian business
The theme of the metaverse became popular this fall when Mark Zuckerberg announced that Facebook would become Meta.
For the market this event was a significant signal: the largest player confirmed the development of a new format of digital interaction between people.
So, business in Russia, as well as all over the world, will invest in creating their own metaverse and its subsequent monetization.
Alienation should be considered as an extension of objectively existing trends.
On the one hand, there is a trend towards creating remote interactions in the conditions of the pandemic, as people are tired of loneliness and restrictions.
The other is the consequence of businesses striving to develop ecosystems and adapt operational models to them.
Thirdly – they are a logical continuation of the trend for digitalization of assets, when any rights, securities, works of art and even money are transferred to a digital format.
Anna, you are right, a change in diet - this is a conscious process.
When you start eating correctly, you no longer have any desire for something too fat and harmful.
Of course, we will have festive treats and traditional olive oil, but no one is forcing me to gorge on everything all at once.
You can have a seat, try it out - and that's it.
After all, there are ten days ahead, and you can prepare any tasty and useful dishes.
How much hard work, time and resources she had to put into training.
Having done five quarters she was left without gold.
She also understands that 4 years before the next Olympics she won't make it, i.e. she will never become an Olympic champion.
And the one who did not engage in sports or cannot present all circles of hell, which she went through, SHOULD NOT BE PUNISHED.
British economist unable to forecast for 2022
British economist Jim O'Neill was unable to predict what will happen in 2022, as he believes that such attempts will end in failure.
He wrote about this in an article for Project Syndicate.
Experts consider that next year will be full of unpredictability and any trend may change the situation.
The most important factor is the pandemic of the coronavirus, and in second place is inflation, he believes.
O'Нилл also admitted that he does not know whether the rise in prices is temporary or not.
As pointed out by experts, even before the pandemic, it was clear that "the world of central banks' infinite generosity has come to an end" and it is time to return to a relationship where interest rates, taking into account inflation, will be correlated with expected growth rates of GDP.
O'Нилл отметил, что на фоне пандемии продолжение сверхмягкой экономической политики может, по мнению некоторых экспертов, вести к новому всплеску инфляции.
In addition, attention should be paid to the issue of productivity growth, as well as poverty levels and climate change, O'Neill summarized.
Earlier, the head of the Global Research Department at Open Investment Michael Shulgin said that positive expectations for the dollar in 2022 remain, with the potential for growth being less significant.
Among the risks to the dollar course, Shulgin named monetary and credit policy of the Fed, dynamics of oil prices and concerns in the light of the pandemic of the coronavirus.
Forced to agree.
But one thing is pleasing: if you compare yourself with yourself, five years ago there were fewer containers.
It's better now.
Progress is there, but it's slow.
Another problem is that there are many ecological initiatives in cities, but people do not know about them.
All ecotaxes, which collect waste from homes.
The point of receiving second-hand goods - marginal groups benefit from it.
Few put glass and metal there.

Russians spend around 4.5% of the country's GDP on car dealers
According to the results of 10 months of 2021, Russians spent 2.784 billion rubles on the purchase of new vehicles, which is 28% more than in the same period of the previous year, according to the statistical data of the agency Russian Automotive Market Research (NAPI).
To understand the scale - approximately the same amount (about 300 billion rubles) was spent by the state to support citizens and the economy during the pandemic of the coronavirus.
In September, at a meeting of the leaders of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, President Vladimir Putin said that such amount is comparable to more than 4.5% of the country's gross domestic product (GDP) for 2020.
In terms of sales in the Russian market, the Korean brand Kia takes the lead.
Over 10 months of this year, he managed to realize automobiles for the sum of 325.7 billion rubles, which is almost 24% more than the previous year.
The growth in the Hyundai brand, which is related to Kia, is even more significant - over 35%, and revenue from car sales is estimated at 279.3 billion rubles.
This brand is in the lead in terms of increasing the average price of a vehicle - for Hyundai it grew by almost 21% over the year to 19.4 million rubles - and the dynamics of price growth were stronger only for Changan, Chery, Geely and Mercedes-Benz.
In this case, the sales volume of Korean brands did not increase so significantly: according to the statistics of the Automobile Manufacturers Committee of the European Business Association in Russia, Kia sold 9.4% more cars than the previous year.
Hyundai - almost 12%.
The trio of leaders in terms of sales volume in monetary terms is headed by Japanese Toyota - Russians spent 27.55 billion roubles on cars of this make over 10 months, which is 14% more than the previous year.
Mercedes-Benz is next with 266.1 billion rubles (+75%) - the volume of sales of the German premium brand increased by 37%, and the average price of a car (almost 28%, to 82 million rubles).
At Mercedes-Benz, sales are growing and the average price is higher - more than that of BMW, for example - which is why financial reserves are growing as well, explained the general director of Rosstandards Tatiana Arabadzhie.
Chinese brands are also demonstrating fantastic growth rates in sales, and substantially increasing their financial clout this year," he added.
The Russian Lada in terms of revenue growth demonstrates median indicators (plus 28%), and Russians spent 22.94 billion rubles on cars of this brand over 10 months.
In terms of financial capacity, companies whose sales in units fell in 2021 include Volkswagen, Mitsubishi and Nissan, among others.
UAZ is in the red - for 10 months, Russians spent 1.2 billion rubles on off-roaders and pickups of this brand, as opposed to 1.24 billion rubles the year before.
Against the backdrop of component supply issues and production disruptions affecting the entire global automotive industry, automakers are continuing to adjust prices - AvtoVAZ increased the price of Lada models seven times during the year, the last hike (by 8-10,000 rubles) took place in late November.
Regularly revise the prices for their products and other car manufacturers.
The volume of the Russian automotive market in monetary terms will continue to grow further – in addition to a shortage of cars, inflation and the desire of automotive groups to make up for past losses are contributing to this, experts believe.
In conditions of a deficit of automobiles, I think that many automobile concerns even managed to pass on to consumers the expenses of previous periods which they could not include in the price of automobiles earlier,
The automotive analyst at VTB Capital Vladimir Bespalov said that
I believe that financially automakers are doing very well now, maintaining high margins on sales."
One indirect indicator of this is the rate of growth in the cost of vehicles observed in 2021: prices for new cars are growing faster than inflation, an expert notes.
In the long term, the market will grow both in terms of quantity and financially, but mainly due to inflation and the complexity of the machines themselves, predicts Bespalov.
The growth in the possibilities for increasing prices will be limited.
In monetary terms, the Russian automotive market will continue to grow even if the rate of growth in the cost of vehicles slows down, and car manufacturers will be able to receive their income due to the volumes, notes independent automotive consultant Sergei Burgazliev.
Taking into account the increased demand and insufficient supply, now car manufacturers strive to get the maximum profit from each sold car, notes Burgazliev.
An increase in the volume of machine production is not expected at least in the next six months. At the same time, in Russia, excitement is fueled by citizens' uncertainty about the future.
In the context of the market situation, cars have become a good investment - a car bought a year ago, even with a run, can now be sold for more than the initial cost, an expert notes.
Biden spoke about the possibility of the US military being deployed to Ukraine in the event of a Russian invasion
The US leadership never considered sending American troops to Ukraine in the event of a "Russian invasion".
This is what President Joe Biden had to say.
There were never such plans, the White House chief said in answer to a journalist's question about whether the United States had abandoned the idea.
Biden said that if the situation around Ukraine escalates, Russia will face economic consequences.
At the same time, he stressed that the United States and NATO have no obligations to use military force to protect Ukraine in the event of escalation.
The American leader also stated that the possibility of using American troops in a unilateral way for the defense of Ukraine is not on the agenda.
Biden explained that if Russia invades the territory of Ukraine, the United States will transfer forces to NATO countries in Eastern Europe (Bulgaria, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Czechia, and Estonia).
We will have to send more American and NATO troops to the East Flank, B9 - all the countries of NATO, regarding which we have a sacred obligation to defend them from any attack from Russia, Biden stated.
Earlier, the press secretary of the Russian president, Dmitry Peskov, stressed that Moscow has no intention of invading the territory of Ukraine.
He said that Moscow regarded the combat use of drones sent to Kiev by Turkey as a problem, as well as the fact that "US weapons are getting closer to our territory."
I leave such interviews immediately.
If at the interview they already want to force me to listen to screams, wait for hours, drink unclear soup and another cup of washing up - it's terrible to imagine what it will be like at work.
I will find a normal place, without a queue, where you can immediately talk to the head.

If a fraudster, posing as an "employee of the Ministry of Internal Affairs" or some other powerful structure, calls from such a number, it is ineffective to hang up immediately and it is unlikely that you will have time to put them on the black list.
Therefore, in order to substantiate his lie about the involvement of the security structures, he quickly repeats the call and continues to scare and persuade.
The people need more useful recommendations.
This is such nonsense...
No way, that's not what happened.
They do not know what to invent, whom to blame.

And, most importantly, according to them, everyone is to blame except the very worst...

Maybe all virus strains will disappear...

But I remember that thoughts are material!

Even such riff-raff as Koba and his gang.
And this bloody Sunday - it's just the Bolsheviks' fantasy.

Earlier it was announced that this film has been nominated for an "Oscar" award as the best foreign language film.
As regular friendly meetings of the presidents of Russia, Azerbaijan and Turkey show, in my opinion, you are, to put it mildly, off the topic.
Only yesterday the President of Azerbaijan approved the opening of a joint Azerbaijani-Russian KamAZ enterprise.
