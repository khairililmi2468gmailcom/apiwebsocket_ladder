From my point of view, the literature curriculum was shaped by women of Balzac's age based on their interests.
Of the Russian literature of the 19th century, we preferred Danilevsky and Volkonsky.
They wrote fiction, of course, from the point of view of those very women of Balzac's age.
And the psychology and torment of Tolstoy's and Turgenev's heroines is not so interesting for teenagers.
Teenagers are rarely interested in the psychology of heroes.
Thank you very much, very interesting.

I remember with horror the banquets and the guests at my parents' house.
The guests are on the doorstep, the meatballs are on the grill, and the mother is scrubbing the floor.
Oh, my God, I'm tired of sitting at that table.
And then do the dishes, clean the house.
A week before the holiday, you're hauling groceries, two days packing, one day cleaning up after.
What about the guests?
They're fine, and they always have a cake with them.
Since then, I don't like parties, guests.
Even for my family, I set the table on the bare minimum.
And I make these little treats for them. I bake them all the time, just for the hell of it.
Germany: Fourth vaccination against coronavirus is inevitable
The fourth vaccination will be required in the summer or fall of 2022.
According to the expert, the current vaccination in Germany will not be final, but will continue with renewed vigour.
Despite an active vaccination campaign in Germany, neither two nor three doses of the coronavirus vaccine are likely to be sufficient for complete protection.
The head of the Association of General Practitioners, Ulrich Weigeldt, is convinced of this.
This was reported by Die Welt on Saturday, December 11.
"We expect that the fourth vaccination will be needed in the summer, at the latest in the autumn", the expert believes.
In addition, Weigeldt hopes that the fourth vaccination against coronavirus can be carried out "in combination with the vaccination against influenza".
This will help to achieve the best results.
In addition, increased vaccination may help combat the spread of the new Omicron strain of the coronavirus.
And the new variant is especially dangerous.
For example, Omicron is three times more likely to re-infect you than Delta or Beta.
This is evidenced by the results of a preliminary study conducted in South Africa.
Based on this, manufacturers BioNTech/Pfizer plan to have a vaccine adapted for Omikron available by March 2022.
The companies emphasize that two doses of the vaccine do not provide sufficient protection against infection with the new Omicron variant of the coronavirus.
A study by BioNTech and Pfizer found that the effectiveness of the vaccine is significantly lower with two doses: "the neutralising potential is reduced by more than 25 times".
"This indicates that two doses of BNT162b2 do not provide sufficient protection against infection with the omicron strain", BioNTech and Pfizer stressed.
That's why the third dose is necessary.
Experts are urging an acceleration of vaccination in the country.
For example, the chairman of the German Society for Infectious Diseases, Bernd Salzberger, advocates shortening the interval between the second and third shots.
Moreover, Salzberger believes that accelerated vaccination will have an impact on the spread of both the delta variant and the omicron variant of the coronavirus.
"The experience of Israel shows this very convincingly", the expert stressed.
The Pontoon21, the Bet-A Vib, the 54 Silent, the 54 mm, the 8.5 g.
The Bet-A-Vib series is a special branch of the Bet-A family from Pontoon21Â®.
It (as well as the Kalikana Vib series) differs from many other vibs in that it was originally created with the use of under-ice fishing in mind, and not just for catching sea bass.
These vibes have a higher specific gravity than similar sized counterparts, which undoubtedly has a positive effect on the nuances of the application of these interesting baits.
Another recognizable feature is the upper fin made of durable and elastic plastic, which creates additional vibration shades when wired vertically and horizontally.
As a "winter vibe" when shooting from behind, Bet-A-Vib exhibits a fairly aggressive gameplay.
Often the most eye-catching is the simple monotonous animation, that is, the up-and-down movement of the striker with almost no pauses.
When planning, the deviation from the vertical axis is not very large, which is convenient when fishing in a limited space, cluttered with underwater vegetation, rods and other obstacles for which a catch is possible.
In addition, a small deviation is relevant when catching winter cod and largemouth bass, and especially in the middle of winter, when point and aggressive bait delivery is required.
Upon reaching the extreme point of the trajectory, the Bet-A-Vib instantly turns around and returns to its original vertical.
Bet-A-Vib is also used successfully for wintering pond trout.
To accommodate its whims, there are two versions to choose from: with (NS  NanoSound) or without (SL  Silent) noise capsules.
It is also noted that the Bet-A-Vib is able to irritate a passive pike, which does not even react to a live one.
The Bet-A-Vib has the range and accuracy to capture the prey.
This wobbler is understandable and not capricious, it combines well with wooden and knitted cords even of large diameters.
For the capture of pike, sudaka, herring or squid, in addition to the uniform actuallna and "step", sometimes with "churcanie" on the bottom.
If you're fishing in a crowded area, you can replace the front triple with a double, which will reduce the chance of snagging.
Bet-A-Vib is among the most durable lures in its class and, as a result, one of the most catchy.
It can be used with equal success on both relatively shallow and fairly deep sites.
All models are equipped with Owner ST-36 hooks.
How many young idlers sit on the necks of old parents.

Libya says it has 7,000 Russian mercenaries
There are over 7,000 mercenaries in Libya for the private military company (PMC) Wagner.
This was stated on Sunday, December 12, by the chairman of the Supreme State Council of the republic, Khaled al-Mishri.
"Currently, there are more than 7,000 mercenaries of the Wagner PMC in Libya.
They have airplanes.
They are also digging trenches in Sirte and Kufra.
They have 30 jet aircraft at the airbases of Gardabi (also used as a civilian airport in Sirte) ", Anadolu Agency quotes him as saying.
Khaled al-Mishri also pointed out that Russian mercenaries are "trying to take over" central Libya, stretching from Chad to the Mediterranean Sea, after "bringing their man to power" in the Central African Republic.
Presence to be retained
According to the interlocutor of the publication, Moscow was looking for a country to maintain its presence in North Africa and "located in Libya".
Wagner has been in Libya since 2019, using an airbase and port in Sirte, as well as an airbase in Jufra, the agency said in a publication.
The Russian government officially denies that Wagner is backed by the Kremlin.
Where else could there be mercenaries?
According to the agency, Wagner is believed to operate in nine African countries - Central African Republic, Libya, Sudan, Mozambique, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Madagascar, Zimbabwe and Angola.
The company provides military training for local forces, personal security for leaders, and protection for energy facilities.
In exchange for these services, Wagner's subsidiaries receive certain privileges and licenses for the use of minerals and natural resources, as well as for the supply of weapons, technology and military services to these countries", the article says.
According to the media, the "Vagnerites" allegedly fought in the Donbas, Syria, Mozambique, Sudan and the Central African Republic.
This group is not listed in any law enforcement agency, nor in the register of legal entities, and its fighters are absent from the formal lists of personnel.
This company is under U.S. sanctions.
Earlier today, the EU's 27 permanent representatives approved restrictions against Wagner.
This decision is expected to be approved by the Council of the European Union on 13 December.
The situation in Libya
Libya's supreme council of state is de facto the second chamber of parliament with advisory functions and dominated by Islamists, TASS reports.
This body has repeatedly called for the postponement of the single day of voting for parliamentary and presidential elections from 24 December to at least February 2022.
"With less than two weeks to go until the elections, the chances that they will be held on time are rapidly decreasing", the report said.
Against this backdrop, Libya's High Election Commission has indefinitely postponed the announcement of the final list of candidates, Sky News Arabia reports.
Foreign policy through the eyes of Russians
38% of Russians see more successes than failures in the country's foreign policy, 29% believe that failures prevail.
"Examples of successes - "in Syria we protected, restored peace there", "the solution for Nord Stream-2", "the whole world was intimidated that the weapons were cool", "we took Crimea".
The main failures were "conflict with Ukraine", "confrontation with Western countries", and "isolation from the world", according to a study by the Public Opinion Foundation.
The Dubai government has completely abandoned paperwork - all government services have also become digital only
The Dubai government has announced a complete move away from paper-based filing to digital filing.
All public services to the population will also be provided exclusively in electronic form.
This is reported by the Emirati news agency WAM.
"Today marks the beginning of a new phase in the digitalization of all aspects of Dubai's life - we have completed the transition to a completely paperless government", the emirate's crown prince, chairman of Dubai's executive council, Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, said on Saturday.
From now on, the internal and external document circulation in all Dubai government institutions will be carried out only in digital form through special information platforms.
The innovation affected all sectors without exception: healthcare, housing, police, municipal bodies, courts, etc. Many commercial structures also joined the government's initiative.
The transition to e-government and the digitization of document circulation began in Dubai in 2018.
In that time, the authorities calculated, 336 million sheets of paper were saved, amounting to 14 million man-hours and $353.8 million in cash equivalents.
Earlier, Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said that electronic services save citizens 2 days a year.
Dana, well, the dates of birth and the age of the child, it's a joke, about the class and the group in kindergarten too.
I can't believe there's such a stretch.
And if they are, they clearly don't give a shit about anyone, including their family.
My mother, her two brothers and grandfather and grandmother lived on 3 Vladimir, there was 1 floor without bars.
Knocked on the door first, knocked on the window, then decided not to be ceremonious, broke the window and went in, but Grandpa had a baseball bat, which they got.
These people definitely knew there was someone in the house...
Turkey's car production and exports fell below 2020 levels
Turkey's car production and exports fell sharply in November amid the depreciation of the lira.
As a result, the industry's 11-month results were worse than last year's, Bloomberg reported, citing data from the Turkish Automobile Manufacturers Association.
According to the association, 115 thousand cars were produced in Turkey in November, which is 20% less than a year earlier.
About 75.9 thousand cars were exported, which is more than 25% less than last year's figure.
And if according to the results of the first 10 months of this year, Turkey's automotive sector demonstrated a positive dynamic compared to last year, then according to the results of the 11 months of 2021, the production of cars was already 0.3% worse than last year's indicator.
The reason for this fall was the sharp weakening of the Turkish lira, which in November fell by 29% against the dollar.
This has led to a decline in economic activity across all industries.
More than 500 SMEs received deferred credit payments in 2021
First Deputy Prime Minister Alihan Smailov spoke about the situation regarding the provision of benefits for small and medium-sized businesses, "Kazinform" MIA correspondent reports.
"According to the information of the Agency of the Republic of Kazakhstan on regulation and development of the financial market, this year in fulfillment of the instruction of the Head of State of April 1, 2021, the order of the Chairman of the Agency of April 9, 2021 No. 127 "On approval of the Procedure for granting deferment of payments on loans of small and medium-sized business entities" was adopted", Alihan Smailov wrote in his response to the deputy's inquiry.
He recalled that the procedure for granting deferral of payments on loans provided for granting by banks and organizations carrying out microfinance activities, deferral of payments on loans issued until April 1, 2021 to SME entities, including IPs, in the period from April 1 to June 30, 2021.
The deferral period ranged from 30 to 90 days at the SME's choice.
The borrower's application could have specified a different payment deferral period.
During the deferral period, claims against the borrower were suspended, the notification of the need to repay the overdue debt, as well as the collection of commissions and other payments by the creditor", the deputy prime minister noted.
In 2021, 603 borrowers-subjects of SMEs received applications to postpone payments on loans to second-level banks, of which 553 SMB subjects received a postponement in the amount of 9.7 billion tenge.
131 SME entities submitted applications for deferment to the MFO, of which 95 entities were granted deferment for the amount of 105.8 million tenge", concluded A. Smailov.
Pulmonologist Puryasev has suggested that people with weakened immune systems are capable of easily carrying the Okmiron strain.
The doctor suggested that people with weakened immune systems could tolerate it more easily than those with stronger immune responses.
Pulmonologist Sergei Puryashev explained why the Okmiron strain of coronavirus could be dangerous.
The reason lies in the conditions in which the virus originated.
Scientists believe that the "ocmyron" originated in the body of an HIV-infected or immunocompromised person.
I mean, when he mutated, he didn't encounter any resistance from the immune system.
It makes him more aggressive.
Due to the lack of an immune response, he became very fast.
Apparently, he has these spike-acids, spikes, maybe more than they should, their antibodies were not cut during the mutations, - comments pulmonologist Sergei Puryashev.
The doctor suggested that people with a weakened immune system might tolerate okmiron more readily than those with a stronger immune response.
Turns out a strong response to anything, to any infection, is not always a good thing.
In such cases, the body can kill itself.
That's what happens with pneumococcal infections, where young people in their 30s die and old people in their 60s sneeze to death.
The young man's immune response is insane, it is completely inadequate: where you could only threaten with a finger, it hits like a cannon on sparrows, - concluded Sergey Puryasev.
The doctor also reminded that the coronavirus has dangerous side effects and the most unpleasant of them is pneumonia.
Pneumonia can be bacterial or viral.
If the former is treated very successfully and quickly, the latter is often the only symptom that can be cured - the body's only hope.
The first sign of developing pneumonia will be the onset of body intoxication - fever, weakness, malaise.
Then there are respiratory symptoms: shortness of breath, sore throat, cough.
Pain on the right or left, abdominal pain can also indicate a developing problem.
Meanwhile, by the end of the year, Russia may begin vaccinating the younger generation, ages 12 to 18.
Virologist, head of the laboratory of genomic engineering of the Moscow Institute of Technology Pavel Volchkov noted that this category is very actively suffering from covid.
Teenagers who go to school have the maximum number of contacts.
This is the most socially active layer, as well as kindergarten students, - said "Moscow 24" Pavel Volchkov, a virologist, head of the laboratory of genomic engineering of the MFTI.
Many thanks to the author for this article.
It's been a pleasure reminiscing...
The Teath-In.
In those distant seventies and eighties, no dance floor could do without the melodies of this group.
And at home, when they got together with their friends, they danced to their music.
Immunologists have hypothesized why obese people become victims of COVID.
The authors studied fat tissue left over from bariatric surgeries and found that fat cells, known as adipocytes, can become infected with the coronavirus.
Immune cells located in the fat tissue, called macrophages, were also infected and showed a strong inflammatory response.
Scientists also examined the adipose tissue of patients who died from COVID and found particles of the coronavirus in the fat surrounding various organs.
We know that HIV and influenza viruses can hide in fatty tissue, using it as a reservoir in an attempt to evade the immune system's response.
SARS-CoV-2 is probably capable of doing the same thing.
Biologist explains the causes of dementia
Candidate of biological sciences Semen Goloshekin named the causes of dementia and talked about ways to prevent it in an interview with Sputnik radio.
According to WHO, more than 55 million people suffer from this disease.
The syndrome manifests itself in a gradual loss of cognitive function - over time, a person finds it difficult to navigate even in familiar surroundings.
Goloshekin noted that the most common causes of dementia are neurodegenerative disorders, head injuries, some infections, metabolic disorders, and a lack of certain vitamins.
Certain factors increase the risk of developing the disease.
These include hypertension, diabetes, high cholesterol, obesity, depression, and alcoholism.
At the behavioural level, factors such as social isolation and lack of active cognitive activity may play a role", he said.
Bad habits, such as smoking, alcohol abuse, sleep disturbances, and sedentary lifestyle, also play a role in the development of dementia.
Among the early signs, the expert noted forgetfulness, an inability to concentrate, and a decline in abstract thinking.
"There is a debate that hearing loss may be both an early manifestation of Alzheimer's disease and a risk factor for it", the biologist added.
To prevent the onset of the disease, WHO recommends maintaining the necessary level of physical activity, training cognitive skills and abilities that require the involvement of memory and logic.
Previously Professor of the Department of Neurology, Neurosurgery and Medical Genetics.
N.I. Pirogova, head of the department of cognitive disorders of the Federal Center for Brain and Neurotechnologies Anna Bogolepova spoke about the causes of memory problems.
Egypt returns nearly 30,000 artifacts smuggled out of the country
In the last 10 years, the government of Cairo has managed to return to the homeland about 30 thousand artifacts that were illegally smuggled out of the country.
This was reported on Saturday, December 11, on the Al-Hayat TV channel by Chief Inspector of the Department of Returned Antiquities of the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities of Egypt, Shaaban Abdel Gawad.
Since 2011, the Egyptian state has managed to return 29,300 artifacts.
This year alone, the Museum of the Bible in Washington, D.C., has uncovered 5,300 artifacts of ancient Egyptian civilization", he said.
Abdel Gaouad clarified that all smuggled out artifacts are registered in the archives.
Right now, the department is working to get them back to Egypt.
In particular, experts are "monitoring worldwide auctions and online sales" through foreign and Egyptian websites, as well as social media.
The chief inspector said that upon return, the cultural treasures are restored and then put on display in museums.
According to him, one of the returned artifacts was an ancient human skeleton discovered in Belgium, which is now part of the exhibition of the National Museum of Egyptian Civilization in Cairo.
In 2020, Egyptian authorities asked Interpol to help locate a bust of the pharaoh Tutankhamun sold at auction in London.
Christie's auction house held an auction on July 4, at which a bust over 3 thousand years old was sold for $ 5.97 million (about 680 million rubles).
This caused discontent on the part of Egypt.
The Egyptian side also claims that the art object was illegally removed in the 1970s from the Karnak temple in Luxor.
The head of Tutankhamun, depicted as the sun god Amun, was kept in a private collection and has not been put up for auction since 1985.
How the relic got to Europe is unknown.
In recent years, Egypt has been actively seeking the repatriation of ancient monuments that were illegally removed from the country at different times.
According to the authorities, 95% of the smuggled antiquities are the result of archaeological excavations by "black diggers".
"The Crimean Tatars are not counted" - and this is correct, because the Crimean Tatars (232 thousand) are an independent people (close to the Turks).
If you want to add, only 42 thousand people - so many Tatars (Kazans) live in the Crimea (see census).
Crimean Tatars are a separate people, and the name of this people consists of two words!
They are united only by the Turkic language group.
FT: Credit Suisse wants access to personal mobile devices of employees
Credit Suisse requires its employees to give the bank access to their personal mobile devices, reports the Financial Times.
The fact is that in Europe and the US, a Swiss bank does not give its employees corporate communication devices, instead offering a discount on the purchase of a mobile phone or smartphone from a partner telecom operator.
Under current rules, a bank can view information on corporate devices issued to its employees, as they are used to handle business matters with colleagues or clients.
The bank has the right to check mobile devices in extreme cases - for example, if an employee used it to conduct a meeting with a client that was not approved by Credit Suisse.
Now that many employees have switched to remote working, the bank wants to extend this rule to all devices that have been used to solve work issues.
According to the newspaper, the bank's management has set a deadline by which employees can become familiar with the new rule.
Officially, Credit Suisse has not commented on the new claim.

Part four.
The last year of life of Sergei Yesenin - 1925 - was fruitful in terms of creativity, but the hardest for the earthly being of the poet and his "ego".
He is no longer part of any literary association, he has merged with Imaginism, he is on his own, but he is known, in demand, at times strongly scolded by critics, even angrily, but the reading public is ready to carry him in their hands.
During the year, more than 60 poems were written, many of them are real masterpieces, the cycle "Persian motifs" was completed, the poem "Anna Snegina" was written, 8 books, the collection "Soviet Russia" were published.
And the main success - at the end of June 25, the State Duma signed a contract with Yesenin for the publication of his works in 3 volumes.
None of Sergei Alexandrovich's contemporary poets has been given such an honor, he is the first!
In addition, it promised very good money - according to the contract, the fee was 1000 rubles per month for 20 months (the director of the plant, for example, received 300 rubles per month, the engineer - 200).
Funds were needed that year as never before.
Yesenin married the granddaughter of Leo Tolstoy, Sofia Tolstoy, it was necessary to arrange the family life, support the sisters Katya and Sasha, as well as the mother.
It seems that life is getting better, there is something to rejoice, but for him everything is painted predominantly in dark tones, as if the nightmare from the poem "Black man" (written in November 1925 and published after the death of Yesenin) materialized:
My friend, my friend,
I'm very and very sick.
I don't know where that pain came from.
Whether the wind whistles
Over an empty and uninhabited field,
That's how I grew up in September,
Alcohol wipes out the brain.
Many of his acquaintances noted that Yesenin had passed out badly, looked ill, and was clearly ill.
Increasing frequency of seizures, nervous breakdowns.
And the reason is probably not just alcoholism...
However, if such a diagnosis - alcoholism - Sergei Alexandrovich someone was put, no reliable documents remained.
Let's say, referring to May 1923, when Yesenin, at the insistence of his fourth wife, American Isadora Duncan, was improving his health in the clinic near Paris with Professor Peter Gannushkin (Yesenin would get to him again two years later, already in Moscow).
But there is plenty of evidence of the poet's singing, scandals on this ground, arrests in the police - scattered over dozens of memoirs.
From the beginning of the 20s, the poet's terrifying romance with the green snake developed rapidly.
At the end of the summer of 1923, Yesenin settled for a short time with his friend, the imazhinist Ivan Startsov.
Surprisingly, despite his very good income, Yesenin never had his own accommodation either in Moscow or in St. Petersburg, he found it in rented apartments, in hotels or with friends.
The elder recalls:
"He came only to sleep, and most of the time in a deranged, drunken state.
One day, returning at four o'clock in the morning, Yesenin fell on the staircase...
He fell, scratched his face and snorted.
When he regained consciousness, he coughed incessantly, splashing blood all over his bed sheets"...
Yes, Yesenin himself, after traveling through Europe and the United States (in the States there was a dry law at that time, but Duncan took with her a decent supply of alcohol), admitted:
"I saw nothing there but taverns and streets...
I'm at the end of my rope and I can't remember people...
Well, he drank, of course...
And I drank because I was homesick".

And he loves, as Lermontov wrote, "with a strange love".
Why did the girl cry during the exam when she hadn't failed it yet?
Why didn't he tell his daughter it wasn't a school?
She'll have a tail.
What's the big deal?
I'll give it to you.
Millions of students know that.

The Polish Foreign Ministry believes that Belarus is using migrants as "weapons" against the EU
Polish Foreign Ministry believes Belarus is using migrants as "weapons"
Poland's Deputy Foreign Minister Pavel Yablonsky expressed the opinion that Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko used refugees as a "weapon" against the European Union and intends to return to such an "operation" next year.
The corresponding statement was made by the Deputy Foreign Minister in an interview with the Australian Financial Review newspaper.
According to Yablonsky, sanctions against Belarus have temporarily "stopped Lukashenko", but he is "actively looking for new ways".
Also, the Polish official is confident that now illegal migrants will be used as weapons "in many parts of the world".
As kp.ru reported earlier, the European Union has implemented a fifth set of sanctions against Belarus.
It affected 17 individuals and 11 organizations.
In Europe, they declared their readiness to further expand restrictive measures against the republic, "if the situation in the country does not improve".
In response, Minsk imposed a food embargo on a wide range of goods from countries that had previously decided to impose sanctions against Belarus.

If your clothes are to serve you for a long time, you need to take good care of them.
Proper storage will extend its life and preserve its attractive appearance.
A coat case will help us do that!
The benefits.
By using a cloth cover, you save a lot of space.
This is especially true if you have a lot of things and a small closet.
A neat appearance.
No more dresses, sweaters and skirts hanging loose.
The neat covers allow the clothes to be sorted and hidden from prying eyes.
For people who use racks instead of a regular cabinet,  is the most optimal option.
The casing reliably protects clothing from dust and dirt, insects, mechanical damage, or possible discoloration.
It prevents clothing from changing shape during long-term storage, prevents the formation of cracks.
Characteristics of covers for clothing.
A special material will allow your clothes to "breathe".
If handled carefully, the life of such a cover is unlimited.
Not only clothing but also blankets, pillows, and bedding can be stored in them.
The case is "sealed" with a strong lightning bolt.
It's important to remember!
Prepare things for long-term storage in advance by cleaning them and unfolding them.

"No Shadow Hat": when a velvet jacket makes a man look ridiculous
Secular events in 2021 were dominated by velvet jackets.
Perhaps the first to announce his new fashion decision was Daniel Craig.
Back in September, at the premiere of "No Time to Die", he appeared in a velvet crimson jacket and a traditional "Bond" butterfly.
His example was followed twice by Prince William, who first wore a non-royal green velvet jacket to The Earthshot Prize award ceremony, and then chose a more classic version for the event in support of the Royal Variety charity.
A couple of weeks ago, the trend was me and Lionel Messi.
The footballer came to take the seventh "Golden Ball" in a velvet Dolce & Gabbana jacket.
By the way, his sons were wearing the same.
AliExpress is already reporting a growing demand for velvet men's jackets in Russia.
According to analysts of the service, received by "Gazette.Ru", they began to buy 1.4 times more often.
The most popular are warm velvet jackets with a lining and a tapered silhouette, the main colors are dark beige, burgundy, dark blue and, of course, black.
The average price of such models is from 3 to 6 thousand rubles. At the same time, men prefer to buy exclusively jackets - they rarely choose velvet suits.
You can't just buy them from online retailers.
There are budget options at H&M, Mango, Next and Zara.
In the luxury segment, velvet jackets this season are represented in almost all brands - and Brioni, and Paul Smith, and Etro, and Saint Laurent.
The most desirable is the Gucci model, in which the brand ambassador Jared Leto appeared at one of the premieres of the film "Gucci House".
When choosing expensive branded jackets, you can be sure that the velvet is made of silk.
Using a special technique, the threads are interwoven to create a dense fabric with a fluffy texture on the outside and a smooth texture on the inside.
More budget options are made of cotton or polyamide, but correspondingly serve less.
Lamoda fashion expert Ilya Vakhoshkin warns that in the case of a velvet jacket, it's not the model or the style that matters, but the fit.
"The velvet requires evening light, so this jacket is ideal if you're going to a party or an event", Vakoshkin explains. "It's also suitable for occasions where the invitation includes the dress code "Black Tie" or "Creative Black Tie".
Another important criterion for selecting a velvet jacket is the status of the buyer.
"The man in the velvet jacket, first of all, should have the right advanced socializing with affluence, - believe the authors of the Telegram-channel about men's fashion "Beautiful Brummell". - The owners of velvet jackets, as a rule, belong to the caste of people who rarely buy tickets.
They are simply invited to appropriate secular events, where there is always a dress code.
Ilya Vakoshkin suggests combining a velvet jacket with the same decorative items: classic trousers with arrows, one-tone shirts, silk ties, loafers with brushes, zippers.
Too simple and everyday things will look out of place.
Fashion experts at Pretty Brummell believe it would be inappropriate for an ordinary employee to wear a velvet jacket at a corporate event, but when it comes to "an executive from among those who run the event, yes, such a thing is appropriate".
If a lower-ranking employee's goal is to move up the complex company hierarchy or win financial bonuses, it's best not to wear a velvet jacket.
The management will accurately evaluate this with the phrase "not according to the hat", - say the editors of the Telegram-channel about men's fashion.
Very ambiguous sensations from the voice.
It's an unnatural timbre, so exhaustingly drawn.
And not at all associated with the pretty face of a young girl.
Honestly, I don't understand the admiration of the people around me.
But from the bottom of my heart, I wish you the best of luck in life.
It's all about the money - alternative energy is well lobbied, which means it pays off.
Billions of dollars worth of investment.
Are they sad?
No, the price of electricity went up.
Traditional energy is also out of the picture - both gas and oil and coal were bought cheaper than they are sold today.
Fuel is in high demand.
The money's flowing.
Then who's in the gap?
Just a regular customer, as usual.
What's the sheriff got to do with Indian problems?
Therefore, Western politicians should not be considered idiots who have "slept through" the energy crisis.
They did their job.
For a good price.
I didn't see any good-looking people in the pictures in the article.
Just mediocrity in terms of the average passenger.
Maybe if these characters are so confident in their beauty that they're willing to show it to the whole train, they're not going to go for it.
But only because of the mental disorder and ignorance of such "beauties", but certainly not because of their appearance.
Kazbek, "the slave who realizes his slavery and fights against it, is a revolutionary.
A slave who is unaware of his slavery and wallows in a silent, unconscious and silent life of slavery is simply a slave.
A slave whose saliva runs when he self-satisfiedly describes the pleasures of slave life and boasts of a kind and good master is a tramp".
The immunologist stated that revaccination after 4-5 months will help protect against the omicron coronavirus strain
Revaccination after four to five months may protect against a new strain of omicron coronavirus infection.
This statement was made by immunologist Nikolai Kryuchkov, who called the vaccination after six months, given the emergence of the new strain, "a very long period"
"With previous strains, such a period was normal, but now it is best to carry out the procedure after five months, and for people with chronic diseases - after four", the expert said, urging revaccination in parallel with the vaccination campaign.
Kryuchkov also noted that early revaccination provides a good titer of neutralizing antibodies.
"If a person has received two vaccines and a booster, or if he has recovered and been vaccinated, or if he has been vaccinated and recovered, then he has received 'hybrid immunity', that is, many antibodies and enough neutralising ones", the expert said.
The G7 has warned Russia of "massive consequences" if it invades Ukraine.
The G7 countries (Great Britain, Germany, Italy, Canada, the United States, France and Japan) issued a statement following a meeting of foreign ministers in Liverpool.
It emphasizes that Russia's "military aggression" against Ukraine "will have enormous consequences and will cost Moscow dearly", but does not describe specific measures.
"We, the Foreign Ministers of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States of America, and the High Representative of the European Union, are united in our condemnation of Russia's military buildup and aggressive rhetoric against Ukraine", the statement said.
The ministers further call on Russia to "de-escalate, use diplomatic channels and abide by its international obligations regarding the transparency of military activities", as US President Biden said during a video call with Russian President Putin on December 7.
"We reaffirm our support for the efforts of France and Germany in the Normandy format to achieve full implementation of the Minsk agreements to resolve the conflict in eastern Ukraine", the G7 foreign ministers said.
Any use of force to alter borders is strictly prohibited by international law.
Russia should have no doubt that further military aggression against Ukraine will have enormous consequences and a serious price to pay in response", they warn.
We reaffirm our unwavering commitment to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, as well as the right of any sovereign state to determine its own future.
We welcome the restrained stance of Ukraine.
We will intensify our cooperation on our common and comprehensive response", the statement added.
Earlier in the day, British Foreign Secretary Elizabeth Truss said that Russia would face "serious consequences" if it invaded Ukraine.
According to her, this meeting showed "the united voice of the G7 countries, which account for 50% of global GDP, and which made it very clear that an invasion of Ukraine would have enormous consequences for Russia".
Pfizer vaccine found to be 32 times less effective than the omicron strain
The effectiveness of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine against the omicron strain of coronavirus is 32 times lower compared to other strains of the disease.
This is the conclusion reached by scientists from the University of Hong Kong and the Chinese University of Hong Kong, reports the South China Morning Post (SCMP).
The vaccine was found to be less effective based on a study of antiviral activity in people who received two doses of the COVID-19 vaccine.
"We see that most people had a high level of antiviral activity against the original variant of Sars-CoV-2, however this ability was significantly reduced against the omicron variant", said Professor Malik Peiris.
At the same time, the scientists emphasized that vaccination remains the most reliable way to protect against the severe course of the disease when infected with coronavirus.
Earlier, scientists from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine predicted the development of the coronavirus pandemic taking into account the influence of the omicron strain on it.
The authors of the study concluded that the omicron strain could cause a new wave of virus circulation and an increase in mortality if additional measures are not taken.
The head of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine accused Germany of blocking the supply of NATO weapons to Kiev
Ukrainian Defense Minister Alexei Reznikov accused the government of former German Chancellor Angela Merkel of blocking Kiev's acquisition of deadly weapons within NATO.
In an interview with the Financial Times on December 12, Reznikov recalled that Germany vetoed Ukraine's purchase of anti-sniper systems and anti-drone rifles last month.
It is noted that later Berlin softened its position regarding rifles, recognizing them as non-lethal weapons.
According to the defense minister, Kiev intends to pursue the acquisition of the aforementioned weapons within the framework of bilateral agreements with allies.
In particular, we are talking about the USA, the UK, Lithuania and France.
Meanwhile, the FT notes that the position of the new German government led by Chancellor Olaf Scholz on allowing arms supplies to Ukraine remains unclear.
Earlier on Sunday, Ukrainian Ambassador to Germany Andrei Melnik expressed the opinion that Kiev should not expect Berlin to supply weapons to Chancellor Scholze.
According to him, the previous leadership of Germany explained its refusal to provide weapons with the risk of developing a military escalation of the conflict in the Donbass, despite the "Russian occupation" of part of the Ukrainian territory.
The same "illogical" position, the diplomat is sure, Germany will maintain under the new chancellor.
In August, Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky said that Kiev expects help from Berlin in equipping the navy.
In Ukraine, they expect that Germany "will be a partner of Ukraine in a technical sense", the president added.
It was also noted that in the spring of this year, the co-chairman of the "green" party of Germany, Robert Habek, visited the republic, where he advocated the sale of defensive weapons to Kiev.

G7 warns Russia of responsibility for invasion of Ukraine
G7 foreign ministers warned of "serious consequences" for Russia if it continues its military aggression against Ukraine, according to a joint statement.
The participants of the meeting also noted that they condemned the strengthening of the Russian armed forces at the borders of the country.
"Russia should have no doubt that further military aggression against Ukraine will have serious consequences and serious costs", reads a statement posted on the UK government's website.
The G7 ministers and the EU high representative said they were "united in their condemnation of Russia's military buildup and aggressive rhetoric against Ukraine".
British Foreign Secretary Elizabeth Truss warned of "great consequences" for Russia in the event of an invasion of Ukraine at a press conference in Liverpool.
We've made it clear that any invasion would have significant consequences...
The G7 wants Russia to abandon its aggression against Ukraine", she said (quoted by TASS).
Earlier, at a summit in Liverpool, G7 foreign ministers agreed that to resolve the crisis over Russia's buildup of troops on the border with Ukraine, the sides needed to return to the negotiating table.
It was about negotiations in the "Normandy format".
The North Atlantic Alliance also supported the dialogue on Ukraine in the "Normandy format".
Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said that by calling for Russia and Ukraine to return to the negotiating table, the G7 countries "signed up to their inability to take responsibility for their own mistakes".

Ways to return stolen money through online stores revealed
There are several ways to recover money stolen from online stores and avoid becoming a victim of fraud in the future.
They were revealed by information security experts in a conversation with RBC.
For example, to reduce the risk of large losses when bank card data falls into the hands of criminals, it is recommended to keep the main funds on the card or bank account that are not used for online shopping.
A portion of your savings can be put into a savings account and withdrawn as needed.
Experts also recommend having a separate card for online purchases.
If your money was stolen while shopping at a store that doesn't use 3D Secure, you can trigger a refund.
"Within the rules established by payment systems, for unauthorized transactions carried out without using 3D Secure, the responsibility lies with the participant in the settlement chain who does not use this service", - said the representative of Promsvyazbank.
An expert from the international payment provider Ecommpay, Arthur Zaremba, stressed that the buyer has the right to file an application with the bank to challenge the fraudulent transaction no later than 120 days after the purchase.
In addition, if the criminal used the card on online resources that do not require two-factor authentication, the transaction can be contested and the money returned.
It is noted that in some cases the online stores themselves return the money to the customer if the order has not yet been sent for delivery.
On November 19, Public Chamber member, Director of the League for Safe Internet Ekaterina Mizulina reported that in 2021 alone, 11 thousand appeals were received for various cases of fraud: from the sale of fake documents to the theft of personal data.
According to her, creating a single complaint window for online fraudsters could be an effective solution in the current circumstances.
Scholz arrived in Poland to discuss Nord Stream 2 and EU legislation
Germany's newly elected chancellor Olaf Scholz arrived in Warsaw for talks on the migrant crisis on the border with Belarus, the independence of the judiciary in Poland, the buildup of Russian troops near Ukraine's borders and the situation with Russia's Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline.
Although Scholz stated his desire to preserve good relations between Germany and Poland for many years, the leaders of the two countries expressed unambiguous expectations of each other.
Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said he would urge Scholz to oppose the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is supposed to carry Russian gas to Germany bypassing Ukraine.
According to Morawiecki, Russia could use the pipeline against Europe as a means of political pressure.
In turn, Germany supported Poland's efforts to stem the flow of migrants trying to enter the country from Belarus.
Berlin has stated that it will help Warsaw and Brussels to resolve this crisis.
Poland's judicial system, however, remains one of the reasons for disagreement.
The European Court of Justice has fined Poland, finding that the judicial reforms carried out by the right-wing Law and Justice party violate EU law.
Poland refused to pay the fine, and its highest court ruled that national law takes precedence over EU rules.
The new German government sworn in on Wednesday, despite demands from Poland and the United States, has made no public commitment to halt the operation of Nord Stream 2 in the event of a Russian invasion of Ukraine.
U.S. officials have told members of Congress that they have reached an understanding with Germany to halt the pipeline if Russia invades Ukraine, a senior U.S. congressional official said Tuesday.
German officials have not confirmed the reports, but Scholz warned on Wednesday of the consequences if Russia violates Ukraine's borders, a position confirmed by the G7 on Sunday.
Dmitri, take a closer look.
The view outside the window is the same, the size of the window hasn't changed.
The wall between the kitchen and the room has been removed, so you can see part of the second window.
And those who aren't familiar with the initial planning are doubtful.
And I know these apartments very well, and I can see how they've been redesigned.
May they be well.
It's always surprising when they write about the means to wash the sink, the toilet, the window sills, the taps.
You wash them once a year at Passover, what do you do, you have to wash them straight away.
Let's just keep it clean.

The plumber who found the money in the wall of the church will be paid 20 thousand dollars
A plumber who found money in the wall of a church in the U.S. state of Texas will be paid a reward.
This is according to a press release from the nonprofit organization Crime Stoppers of Houston.
The incident took place at a large evangelical church in Lakewood, where pastor Joel Austin preaches a sermon promising wealth and prosperity to devout Christians.
In November 2021, plumber Justin Cowley was repairing one of the church's toilets and found thousands of bags of cash and checks under the insulation.
He gave the find to the church, and according to him, Austin never even thanked him.
"I wanted to hear him say, 'You know, Justin, you did the right thing.
We understand what you did and what you could have done", KPRC-TV quoted him as saying.
Apparently, the find is related to a robbery that occurred at Lakewood Church seven years ago.
At the time, about $200,000 in cash and $400,000 in checks were missing from the church's safe deposit box.
The money was insured, so the church didn't suffer any losses.
Nevertheless, a $25,000 reward was offered for information about the perpetrators.
Justin Cooley couldn't claim that amount because the award had already expired.
Despite this, the nonprofit organization Crime Stoppers of Houston, which at the time provided $5,000 for the award and later received another $20,000 in donations from Lakewood Church, decided to reward the plumber's honesty.
He's going to get $20,000.
It was previously reported that police have questioned Pastor Joel Austin about money found in the wall of Lakewood Church.
Tanya, what she says, what she does, that's what defines her as a real person.
That's why the attitude towards it is so negative.
And it's not that "she's financially significantly richer than all the scumbags", as it says here.
There are people richer, but not all behave as brazenly, as provocatively as this madame.

Brazil has made it mandatory to require Covid passports from those entering the country, according to a ruling by Brazilian Federal Supreme Court (STF) Judge Luis Roberto Barroso.
This is reported by CNN Brasil.
Citizens who have contraindications to vaccination are exempt from presenting a vaccination certificate.
Exceptions are also made for those arriving from countries where the absence of a vaccine has been proven.
"The situation is even more serious if we consider that Brazil is a popular tourist destination for New Year's Eve, pre-carnival and carnival parties, as well as other events, which implies an increase in tourist flow", said Barroso.
Earlier, Brazilian authorities ordered unvaccinated tourists to observe a five-day quarantine.
The scheme of complete protection against COVID-19 has been revealed
Virologist, doctor of medical sciences, honored scientist of Russia Anatoly Altstein in an interview with Ura.ru revealed the scheme of complete protection from coronavirus infection.
According to him, this can be achieved through the administration of an injection and the use of a nasal vaccine.
When administered internally, large amounts of immunoglobulin A are produced. This does not occur when the vaccine is injected.
Immunoglobulin A protects the mucous membrane, so the virus cannot enter the body.
And inside, after vaccination, we have the most immunoglobulins G (antibodies) produced.
And if you give both vaccines, you will get a lot of immunoglobulins A and G. But there is no decision yet on double vaccination", the doctor said.
Chief prophylactologist of UrFO, Doctor of Medical Sciences Sergei Tokarev, in turn, stated that the main advantage of using nasal vaccination together with injection is the ability to stop being a carrier of COVID-19.
He added that this would help because the body's defenses would then presumably be maximized.
Earlier, the Minister of Health of the Nizhny Novgorod Region, David Melik-Huseynov, stated that the spread of the new coronavirus infection among children will lead to a new outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic.
According to him, this is the picture in other countries where the next wave of the pandemic arrived earlier.
Ina, um... what are you doing?
I had this conversation with a long-dead mare. If you're willing to trade the warmth of your home, your feeding trough, your caresses, your love, and your games for a fluid bitch, go for it.
But Pessel was trained and generally a smartass.
Picked my company and went home.
In the video, there's a method that works 90% of the time.
It's not from the ceiling, believe me.
I've stopped a lot of owners from running after their dogs, even though they said, "There's 200,000 running away", and I've taken them by the hand and led them the other way.
In the end, "200,000" chose a master, not a dog that ran away somewhere.
Mass protests against vaccination continue in Europe
In the Austrian capital of Vienna, more than forty thousand demonstrators took to the streets.
They expressed dissatisfaction with the restrictive measures and the authorities' plans to make vaccination against Covid compulsory.
From February next year, non-vaccinated people will have to pay a fine of 3600 euros.
Spaniards, outraged by the government's health policy, held a peaceful march in Madrid.
Some held placards that said, "This is a fake pandemic", "I won't get vaccinated".
A major protest against sanitary passports took place in Barcelona, the capital of Catalonia.
In the autonomous community, a covid certificate is mandatory for access to bars, restaurants, gyms, nursing homes and nightclubs.
The decision to introduce sanitary passports by the authorities of a number of regions of the country was taken against the backdrop of an increase in the number of cases of coronavirus infection.
In Luxembourg, more than a thousand demonstrators protested against the tightening of restrictive measures and QR codes.
The action started peacefully, but then escalated into clashes with the guards of order.
A group of protesters began throwing stones at police officers.
In response, law enforcement officers used water cannons.
Nikolai S., even in Wikipedia there is no consensus on this matter.
Kashevarova-Rudneva is also designated as "the first Russian doctor, doctor of medicine", probably because she started studying earlier.
Let's just not argue, I think they both deserve the title.
The only thing I agree with Zakharova is that the Americans brought nothing but death and plunder to any country wherever they appeared.

WHO has detected Omicron in more than 60 countries.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has said that the new strain of the coronavirus Omicron has been detected in 63 countries.
A number of experts are already saying that the spread of a new strain could have catastrophic consequences.
The pace of the spread of the strain was described in a WHO report.
According to the organization, as of 9 December, the strain has been detected in 63 countries, in all six WHO regions.
This is despite the fact that it has only been actively spreading since the end of November.
WHO is also concerned about the high rate of spread of the new variant of the coronavirus.
WHO experts fear that the new strain, according to preliminary data, may surpass the prevalence of the "delta" strain, the Indian variant of the coronavirus, which is now leading in absolutely all countries without exception.
Earlier, the director general of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, stated that the omicron strain could have a significant impact on the course of the coronavirus pandemic.
Similar findings have been made in the United Kingdom.
Experts at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) believe that Omicron will displace Delta in the coming months.
And the number of cases in the UK alone will be close to one million, despite the fact that officially Omicron has a few hundred people in the UK at the moment, and estimates are as high as 10,000.
British experts predict tens of thousands of deaths from the Omicron strain, and at its peak, more than 2,000 people will be taken to hospital every day.
Which the British healthcare system will be unable to cope with.
The situation is complicated by the fact that according to the latest studies, the effectiveness of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine against the Omicron strain is 32 times lower compared to other types of the disease.
How the Russian Sputnik V will react to Omicron is not yet known - it will become clear in the next few weeks.
The Gamaleya Center has just begun testing the Russian vaccine on the Omicron strain.

Curious Squirrel, you're right, chatting online is very different, you communicate easily and casually, and when you meet in person, there's nothing to say.

Once again, the Soviet era is being called "the age of demons".
After all, people back then believed in God in a much more honest way than they do today.
Yes, they were practically brought up according to God's laws (love of neighbor, do not steal, etc.).
What today's ideology is money at any cost.
Boltons like Globo have little to no faith, but even if they do, the time of the demons came in the '90s...

Russians have been warned about a new scheme of fraudsters
The attackers have begun to look for new maneuvers for video-message fraud.
This is reported by "Izvestia" with reference to experts.
According to Ivideon's product director Zaur Aboutalimov, the main danger associated with the proliferation of video communications is deepfakes.
In this case, the scammers create a fake video based on real footage involving the victim.
This makes it possible for the neural network to accurately replicate the characteristics of a person's behavior.
Aboutalimov added that by using deepfake, attackers can call a victim's acquaintance via video call or create a video featuring a copy of the person to send for blackmail purposes.
"Such fakes can easily trigger bullying, as a skilled attacker can put people into ridiculous, dangerous or compromising pseudo-scenarios", the expert said.
Varonis lead systems engineer Alexander Vetkol, in turn, noted that psychologically, people trust others more when they see them.
He stressed that this could create specific risks when it comes to video-based technologies.
David, I'll add to that.
In what I wrote above, I emphasized the fact that I bought all these things in a small town where the local mentality did not allow for a lot of makeup and walking in short skirts, showing stockings and tights on the legs.
It's provincial, but the store had it.
In the big cities, Muslim women also painted their faces and showed their legs.
That's how it is in Dushanbe, it's a big city, the capital of the republic.
There's a lot of models, but not the same makeup.
Five things you can do to prevent diabetes
Blood sugar problems are among the most common in the world.
Some, however, take it for granted, and wrongly so.
Over time, diabetes can lead to serious complications and even death.
Preventive measures play a major role in preventing the development of diseases.
For example, doctors recommend a change in drinking habits - reducing the amount of various drinks and switching to plain water has a positive effect on metabolism.
Sweet foods raise blood sugar to dangerous levels when consumed in excess.
So the first step to a healthy lifestyle is to stop buying sweets and keep them at home.
In addition to diet, habits also play a role in the onset of the disease.
To reduce the risk of diabetes, you need to exercise a lot.
Experts recommend following a low-carbohydrate diet.
Not only will such a diet help you lose weight but it will also protect you from sudden fluctuations in blood sugar levels.
To protect yourself from diabetes, you need to eat a lot of fiber.
Dietary fiber fills the stomach and thus promotes a feeling of fullness, the secretion of digestive juices, and increased digestion.

Dr. Pavlova spoke about the "weekend migraine" of workaholics
Several factors can contribute to a worsening of the weekend's well-being.
The reason for the deterioration of well-being after working days is often "the migraine of the day off", said the famous doctor-endocrinologist, candidate of medical sciences, senior researcher at the faculty of fundamental medicine of Moscow State University, scientific director of the clinic of Systemic Medicine, Zuhra Pavlova in her telegram channel.
According to her, it is especially common among workaholics, who experience headaches, fatigue, and weakness on weekends.
Dr. Pavlova noted that in addition to the fatigue accumulated during the week, there are many objective reasons for the body's negative reaction to changing conditions.
The weekend changes our lives forever.
"We sleep a lot, lie on the couch all day, probably eat more and drink less", argued the doctor.
From overeating and lack of water - heaviness and brokenness".
Late rising plays an additional role.
For example, if you wake up three hours later than usual, you have a reaction called jetlag.
It occurs in travelers who cross multiple time zones.
To determine which of the factors plays a decisive role in the deterioration of well-being, Pavlova recommended to observe what changes most strongly on weekends.

South African scientists report low efficacy of Pfizer's vaccine against Omicron
South Africa says Pfizer's vaccine against Omicron is ineffective
Scientists in the Republic of South Africa conducted a study and reported low efficacy of the Pfizer vaccine against the omicron strain of the coronavirus infection.
It is estimated to be equivalent to the vaccine's 22.5% efficacy against symptomatic infection, which... casts doubt on the vaccine's ability to protect against infection, according to the study published on MedRxiv.
At the same time, experts clarified that the drug can save from the severe course of the disease.
Earlier, the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine predicted that the omicron strain of coronavirus could cause a new wave of the pandemic in the UK with more frequent hospitalizations than a year ago.
How much hidden sugar is in conventional foods?
Sugar is not the best source of beneficial nutrients.
Too much of it in the diet can lead to type 2 diabetes, as well as cardiovascular disease and cancer.
Consumers should be aware that an unfamiliar word in a product's composition may indicate a hidden sugar - an ingredient similar to sugar in calorie content, composition, and glycemic index.
There may be dozens of names on the label that actually refer to sugar.
Some of the most common and frequently encountered names are glucose and fructose.
There may also be other sugars, such as dextrose (sugar derived from corn), levulose (fruit sugar), molasses (black potato), agave syrup, etc.
These are all simple carbohydrates that belong to the mono- and disaccharides, and they can be found not only in confectionery, but also in ketchup, doctor's sausage, bread, and so on.
According to the Food and Drug Administration, the most effective way to reduce your sugar intake is to eat whole and unprocessed foods, as well as to pay attention to the labels and the many different names for sugar.
Different types of sugar taste differently, but no matter what the ingredient is called - syrup or nectar, processed or unprocessed, brown or white - it is still sugar.
It is not easy to calculate the exact amount of sugar, since it is necessary to take into account not only the amount of sugar indicated by the manufacturer on the packaging, but also the fact that vegetables, fruits, etc. originally contain a certain amount of sugar.
Thus, the total amount of sugar may be significantly higher than what is indicated on the label.
German Chancellor Scholz: Gas will lose importance for Germany in 25 years
Germany's new chancellor, Olaf Scholz, has said that gas imports are losing importance for Germany as the country continues its transition to a decarbonized economy.
According to him, Germany plans to completely abandon gas, oil and coal by 2045, becoming a climate-neutral country.
"That is, in 25 years the world will be such that the question of gas transportation to Germany and Europe will play a different role", said the chancellor.
Scholz noted that Germany continues to remain committed to Ukraine transporting Russian natural gas in the future, as at the moment this resource is important for the energy transition.
He recalled that Germany and the United States made a statement in which Berlin's support for Ukraine's energy transformation was recorded.
Earlier, German Foreign Minister Annalena Berbok said that the process of certification of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline is continuing.
According to the minister, within the framework of the coalition negotiations and the discussion of the coalition agreement, it was stated that European law in the field of energy should be applied to energy projects.
The diplomat also pointed out that the pipeline still "does not comply with the prescriptions" of the European Union.

Hackers hack into the Twitter account of India's Prime Minister
Hackers have hacked into the Twitter account of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
The attackers managed to post a fake message.
It has been reported that India has allegedly recognized bitcoin as a legal tender, and that the country has already purchased the cryptocurrency.
Modi's office has asked me to ignore the new messages.
The Prime Minister's representatives said that Twitter reacted quickly and restored access to the account.
The Prime Minister of India's website was hacked in 2020 and urged people to donate to the fund using cryptocurrency.
In a referendum in New Caledonia, the majority voted against independence.
In New Caledonia, the third referendum, held on 12 December, ended with the same result as the previous two.
According to the first partial results announced at noon on Sunday, December 12, the majority of New Caledonians voted in a referendum against the independence of their territory.
However, the turnout in this third vote was significantly lower than in the previous two.
According to preliminary results released by local authorities, 3.51% (2,755 people) voted "for" New Caledonia's independence from France, while 96.49% (75,762) voted "against".
Turnout was 43.90%, with over 80,000 New Caledonians participating in the elections.
As France-Presse comments on these interim results, "the outcome of these elections left no room for doubt", as supporters of independence called on voters not to participate in the vote.
As the initiators of the referendum, they opposed its holding on December 12, believing that the new outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic in the archipelago prevents a full-fledged and "honest" election campaign.
Thus, this non-participation paved the way for the third victory of the supporters of French New Caledonia, after the referendums held in November 2018 and in October 2020.
In 2018, 56.7% of residents voted against independence, in 2020 - 53.3%.
The separatists have said they do not recognise the results of the latest vote and will challenge them at the UN.
As reported on Sunday, December 12, at the ElysÃ©e Palace, French President Emmanuel Macron is due to speak on the results of this referendum.
The theme of New Caledonia's independence has largely animated the final weeks of the presidential campaign in France.
Several presidential candidates have argued for the territory to remain part of France, as it is "the last region of European Union presence in the Pacific".
"New Caledonia must necessarily remain French", Eric Zemmour has repeatedly said.
A similar statement was made by Republican candidate Valerie Pecres, who in late October published a column in Le Figaro urging Caledonians to remain French.
For his part, Emmanuel Macron announced in May 2018 that he would not take the position, "because it is not his responsibility".
However, the president added: "France would be less beautiful without New Caledonia".
Prime Minister Jean Castex, for his part, expressed "a strong desire that the choice of the Caledonians be the choice of France".
The light, hey, hey!
I've made you a little... a lot of noise, it's still awkward, it's embarrassing.

Readers of the WSJ criticized an article about Russia-U.S. relations
Readers of The Wall Street Journal criticized an article by Professor Christopher Hartwell, in which he described his vision of Russian-US relations.
The author of the article expressed concern that the West is allegedly sacrificing Ukraine to Russia.
In his article, he warns readers of the danger posed by Moscow and makes a number of derogatory remarks about Russian President Vladimir Putin.
In the end, Hartwell called on Western countries to "make a united front against Russia".
Readers of the WSJ have expressed their disagreement with the American professor's position.
"There is quite a lot of false information in this article", RIA Novosti quoted one reader as saying.
"Europe is not ours to lose, and Ukraine is not our land.
The U.S. and its NATO allies will never engage in a nuclear war with Russia over Ukraine", noted another.

An earthquake with a magnitude of 5.2 occurred near the Kuril Islands
An earthquake with a magnitude of 5.2 occurred near the Kuril island of Shikotan.
It is noted that the epicenter of the earthquake was 231,8 km northeast of the city of North Kurilsk.
The fire was at a depth of 92.5 kilometers.
Earlier, seismologists recorded a 7.5-magnitude earthquake in Peru that injured ten people.

Ukraine will start producing jet drones of the new generation
The new Ukrainian-Turkish plant will begin to create ANKA-type jet-powered unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).
This was reported on December 11 by the non-staff adviser to the head of the office of the Ukrainian president, Alexey Arestovich.
So they're capable of acting against airborne objects, other drones.
Even against manned aircraft.
They will have Ukrainian engines and the rest of the Turkish avionics: the hull and the like", - quotes him Dialog.ua.
Commenting on the main features of the ANKA devices, Arestovich said that we are talking about jet, not piston UAVs.
According to him, this is a new generation of drones after Bayraktar, which surpasses it "in all characteristics".
The first batch of UAVs should be produced by the plant at the end of next year, Arestovich concluded.
The ANKA aircraft was created by the Turkish Aerospace Agency in February 2014.
The development of the drone has been carried out by the Turkish authorities in cooperation with a number of private companies since 2010.
The day before, the Ukrainian General Staff classified data on the use of Bayraktar drones and Javelin missile systems during military operations of the combined forces in the Donbas.
On December 6, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky announced that the construction of a plant to manufacture modern military drones had begun in the country.
According to him, Ukraine intends to use drones.
On September 29, the company Bayraktar Savunma and the Ukrainian Defense Ministry signed an agreement on the construction of a center in the Kiev region, which will conduct personnel training, as well as testing and servicing of Turkish Bayraktar UAVs.
The press-service of the office of the Ukrainian leader called this memorandum "a great real step forward".
Two lions escaped from a container at the airport.
Lions have escaped from Singapore's Changi Airport.
This is reported by The Straits Times.
Two predators managed to escape from a container with seven lions that had arrived on one of the planes.
The publication notes that it remains unknown from which country they were brought to Singapore, and where they were headed.
One of the escaped lions has taken up residence on the roof of the container.
The animals could not get away from him because of the safety net installed nearby.
The confrontation ended with the arrival at the airport of the Mandai Wildlife Group, which manages all of Singapore's zoos.
They've immobilized the lions with tranquilizer darts and plan to transport them to a quarantine facility.
Earlier it was reported that in Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia, a lion ran away from its owner and wandered the streets of the city.
On the same day, the animal returned home voluntarily, the people were not harmed.
Experts warned of the risk of cancer due to vitamin B9
Research shows that an excess of vitamin B9, also known as folic acid, can lead to cancer.
The Daily Express warned of this.
According to experts, there is strong evidence that people who are not deficient in folic acid are less likely to develop certain cancers, particularly colorectal cancer.
On the contrary, overdosing promotes the growth of cancer cells.
Nutritionist Beth Kitchin, a professor at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, recommends that you monitor the amount of folic acid you consume throughout the day.
The optimal dose is 400 micrograms per day.
The risk of cancer increases only if you deviate significantly from this number by more or less.
Kitchin recommends not taking vitamin B9 tablets without a doctor's advice, be sure to follow the dosage, and avoid milkshakes and other foods that contain folic acid.
Earlier, nutrition consultant Rachel Fine named folic acid as a substance that slows aging.
Because it is found, among other things, in the avocado, Fine recommended that men over 50 eat the fruit more often.
In the UK, about 75,000 people could die from omicron by April.
Forecasts by British scientists indicate that up to 75,000 people could die in England in the next five months due to the spread of the omicron strain of the coronavirus, unless restrictive measures are tightened in winter.
This was reported by The Guardian newspaper, citing a study by experts from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), reports TASS.
According to the most optimistic forecast of specialists who are part of the Scientific Advisory Group on Emergencies under the British Cabinet, by April 2022, at least 25 thousand deaths due to the omicron strain will be recorded in the country, and a total of about 175 thousand patients will be hospitalized.
At the peak of the outbreak, hospitals will be admitting more than 2,000 patients daily.
"Serious measures to combat coronavirus may be required to avoid overloading the National Health Service if the omicron strain turns out to be more contagious than the delta variant and current vaccines cannot rule out infection", said mathematician Rosanna Barnard of the LSHTM.
Earlier, the UK's Health Security Agency said that if the current rate of spread of the omicron strain continues, there will be about 1 million cases by the end of the year.
By mid-December, the omicron strain could become dominant in the United Kingdom.
There are currently 1,898 confirmed cases of the omicron strain of coronavirus in the UK, of which 633 have been detected in the last 24 hours.
On December 9, the head of the British Ministry of Health, Sajid Javid, pointed out that in reality, this figure could already reach 10 thousand cases.
I was going to write some clever comment, but I got to this part:

Worldwide demand for superyachts has increased by a quarter
Superyacht construction this year and next year's orders are breaking world records, despite calls to reduce our carbon footprint and combat climate change.
In the world register of ships, the number of ordered yachts amounted to 1,200 units - a quarter more than last year.
In an era of tackling the effects of climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions, it is hard to imagine that the number of people willing and able to afford a floating fortress worth Â£50 million or more will not decrease, reports The Guardian.
However, there are more and more of them.
This year, 25% more ships were ordered than the previous year.
Brokers say the market hasn't been this buoyant in 20 years.
The first reason is that many people who can afford a yacht fear infection on land and prefer to escape the pandemic aboard their own vessel.
The second reason is also related to the coronavirus.
Whereas in the past, all these people used to go to the office and meet their business partners face-to-face, now the vast majority of them work remotely and conduct their negotiations by zooming in.
Broker Will Christie told the newspaper that the shipyards are taking orders for new yachts for 2025 and beyond.
This means that customers are willing to pay more if their yacht is ready at least a year or two earlier.
"People just crave freedom, and the super-rich can afford it", he says.
In Western society, many criticize this behavior of the rich and call it decadent.
The rich, say sociologists, don't want to understand that in an age of space denial, living on yachts or flying their own planes is causing a public uproar because the elite don't want to share responsibility for climate change with the rest of humanity.
Economists are calling on governments to take action and are proposing new taxes and regulations for the super-rich, even though they understand that with this kind of money mobility, it's going to be extremely difficult to implement.
Meanwhile, not only is the number of superyachts ordered impressive, but so are their characteristics.
Of the 1,200 vessels, 27 have a stern length of more than 100 meters.
Norwegian billionaire Rekke is building a 600-foot yacht called the REV Ocean.
When launched, it will be the largest yacht in the world.
The yacht includes a "moon pool", as well as a submarine designed to study the depths of the sea.
Helicopter pads, open-air cinemas, and a platform for martial arts have become commonplace on existing superyachts, such as the wrestler McGregor's yacht. Richard Wilk, a professor of economic anthropology at Indiana University in the United States, says that the carbon footprint of the super-rich is negligible compared to the total amount of greenhouse gas emissions.
But it has a symbolic meaning when you consider that there are just over 2,000 multi-billionaires in the world.
This is just another example of overconsumption by a very small group of people.
Scientists have found that the carbon footprint of billionaires is thousands of times larger than that of the average person on the planet.
If one person produces an average of 5 tons of CO2 per year, then the planet's biggest polluter, Roman Abramovich, is responsible for 33.9 tons of greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere in 2018.
Two-thirds of the emissions were traced to his 162.5-metre yacht, the Eclipse.
Even if the owner is not on board, the crew continues to poison the planet.
The owner can call the captain and give the command to bring the yacht, for example, from the Mediterranean to the Caribbean.
Superyacht owners do not evoke the sympathy of others when they, like Australia's richest woman Gina Reinhardt, who owns mines on the continent, complain on YouTube that there is no place for their giant ships to dock.
It's also hard to understand her call to build marinas for ships over 50 meters.
A dangerous weekly dose of alcohol has been identified that leads to the development of bowel cancer
Scientists in the United States have determined how much alcohol a person drinks per week increases his or her risk of developing cancer.
The Daily Express reports on this.
Experts have concluded that drinking four or more alcoholic beverages a week is associated with an increased risk of developing cancer.
However, the likelihood of developing the disease increases with the amount of alcohol consumed.
Moreover, men who drink moderately have a higher risk of developing bowel cancer than women.
Scientists are unable to pinpoint the exact cause of this type of cancer, noting only that certain factors lead to a detrimental process in the body.

Dogs can understand words and phrases at the level of a two-year-old child.
Many, if not all, dog lovers are convinced that these creatures are very intelligent.
But even they have no idea how advanced four-legged pets really are.
Over the years, biologists have conducted various experiments to find out for sure how intelligence develops in animals.
Although a dog's vocabulary is not as extensive as that of a human, a new study proves that a dog can respond consistently to 89 words or phrases.
The scientists' work was published in Sciencealert.
Dogs can't play chess or write poetry, they don't understand politics, economics or art, and yet they often manage to fool their owners.
Experts believe that some breeds are better at understanding the words of human language, but there are not enough statistics to draw accurate conclusions.
For example, some breeds are traditionally considered to be dog geniuses, such as the Labrador.
Scientists have concluded that dogs are capable of logical thinking and that their learning ability is comparable to that of a two-year-old child.

The United States and Russia are preparing for trade in Ukraine
The U.S. and Russia will "bargain" over Ukraine's entry into NATO, analyst Alexander Kochetkov said in an article for Glovred.
In his opinion, Washington and Moscow plan to continue negotiations in the near future over the United States' guarantees that Ukraine will not join the North Atlantic Alliance, despite US leader Joe Biden's words about the right of countries "to join anywhere".
If you're offered something you know is unacceptable, like selling a close relative into sexual slavery, you don't bargain, you just send the bidder.
And with regard to Ukraine, a bargain is planned", the analyst wrote.
Kochetkov added that Russia does not plan to attack Ukraine, but seeks dialogue with Kiev.
"Preparations are being made covertly, quickly and immediately moving on to offensive action, rather than waiting for the group to be detected and deployed counter-measures", he said.
China promotes railway transport
Advanced Chinese technology attracted the attention of companies from the United States, Germany, France and other countries at the 2021 China International Rail Transport and Equipment Manufacturing Exhibition held in Zhuzhou City, Hunan Province (Central China).
Core technologies developed by CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co. Ltd. allow trains to automatically detect and diagnose technical malfunctions, company representative Hou Zhaowen said.
High-speed trains running on the China-Laos railway line, which opened earlier this month, are already equipped with this technology, which will improve the reliability and performance of rolling stock.
Over the past six months, China has significantly increased its exports of rail vehicles, and many countries in Asia and Europe are witnessing "Chinese speed".
In May of this year, the first two-story high-speed electric trains developed in China for export to Europe rolled off the production line of CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co., Ltd.
With a maximum operating speed of 125 miles [200 km] an hour, these trains will run on the railways of Austria, Germany, Hungary, and other European countries.
In November, the test operation of the metro train developed by the above-mentioned company for Turkey began.
The train will travel along the metro line connecting the center of Istanbul with the city's airport.
This subway line will open next year.
It will be the fastest metro line in Turkey with a speed of 120 kilometers per hour.
"China's rail transport equipment industry is one of the industries with the highest level of innovation and the strongest international innovation competitiveness", said Feng Yaoxiang, head of the trade and investment department of the China Committee for the Promotion of International Trade (CCIPT).
"This industry is the main competitive advantage of China's production of high-end equipment in the world market", said Feng Yaoshan.
After more than 60 years of hard work and a series of independent research and development, China has established an advanced railway equipment production system with a full range of ancillary facilities and large-scale manufacturing activities.
According to Feng Yaoshan, the country ranks first in the level of electrification of railways and in the operational mileage on high-speed and urban railways.
Biologist lists early signs of dementia
Biology candidate Semen Goloshekin in an interview with Sputnik radio listed the early signs of dementia.
According to him, signs of future dementia can include forgetfulness, as well as a range of mild cognitive impairments, such as an inability to concentrate, to plan, a decreased level of abstract thinking.
There is a current debate that hearing loss may be both an early manifestation of Alzheimer's disease and a risk factor for it, he said.
Golosheykin emphasized that the causes of dementia can be neurodegenerative disorders, head injuries, some infections, metabolic disorders, lack of certain vitamins.
He added that Alzheimer's disease and atherosclerosis of the blood vessels of the brain are the most common causes of this syndrome.
The biologist noted that to date, doctors do not know effective ways to treat dementia.
Therefore, early prevention is essential.
According to him, learning foreign languages and actively communicating will help reduce the risk of developing dementia.
WHO also recommends maintaining a moderate level of physical activity, regularly training cognitive skills through games and hobbies that require intensive involvement of memory and logical thinking.
"There are recommendations for the use of various dietary supplements, but their effectiveness and feasibility are still being debated in the scientific community", said Golosheykin.
"The World Health Organization recommends maintaining a moderate level of physical activity, regular training of cognitive skills and abilities through games and hobbies that require intensive involvement of memory and logical thinking", said Golosheikin.
Earlier, the dementia research charity in the UK said that the disease is increasingly affecting people over the age of 40.
Doctors have identified the early symptoms of Alzheimer's disease.
The first warning sign is a visual problem that makes it difficult for the patient to recognize objects.
Another sign of developing dementia is what experts call aphasia, a condition in which a person cannot find the right words to convey what he or she wants to say.
Neurologist demands to send Saakashvili abroad for treatment
Former Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili is in need of psycho-nervous treatment and rehabilitation abroad, neurologist Otar Toidze, who is part of the doctors' council set up by the Georgian ombudsman, told reporters.
His [Saakashvili's] neurological status is a leading cause of his illness.
Stable problems are problems with movement, coordination, changeability of character", said the specialist, noting that this does not go beyond the normative framework and now the ex-president needs to be sent for special rehabilitation.
"This is what we call neurorehabilitation and psycho-nervous rehabilitation, the possibility of which we did not find in Georgia", Toidze said, demanding that Saakashvili be treated in a special institution, which does not exist in Georgia.
On the evening of December 7, Saakashvili began to sabotage the receipt of medical assistance after prison officials disciplined him.
The Georgian politician quickly managed to abolish the punishment and restore himself to his former rights.

Protests against COVID passports in Spain
Protests against mandatory COVID-19 vaccination certificates were held in the Spanish cities of Barcelona and Valencia, reports Europa Press.
In the Catalan capital, the number of participants in the action was approximately 3 thousand people.
In Barcelona, COVID-passports have become mandatory to go to bars, restaurants, gyms, nursing homes and nightclubs.
Many protesters came to the rally without masks.
With slogans on their posters, they accused the state of totalitarianism and called for respect for the choice of citizens.
In Valencia, vaccination passports will also be required to enter enter entertainment venues and restaurants with a capacity of more than 50 people.
Protesters in this city have called for a medical dictatorship and called vaccination an experiment.
In Spain, more than 5.2 million cases of coronavirus infection have been detected since the start of the pandemic, with more than 88 thousand patients dying.
Russia is also planning to introduce restrictions for the unvaccinated.
The draft laws on the unified system of QR-codes were submitted to the State Duma by the government on November 12.
It is assumed that Russians will be able to visit places of mass events, cultural institutions, catering facilities and retail trade with the presentation of either a certificate of vaccination or a transferred disease, or a vaccination certificate.
The same rules will apply to train and air travel.

The steep climb: how the Chinese are becoming alpine skiers
The Olympics should attract millions of people to the slopes and help create world-class resorts in the country.
China hopes that the Olympics will not only attract 300 million citizens to participate in winter sports, raising the 1 trillion yuan targeted by President Xi Jinping, but also contribute to the economic development of backward remote provinces.
Taiwu Ski Resort in Zhangjiajie, located near the site of the Winter Olympics, is becoming increasingly popular with the Chinese.
In addition to infrastructure construction in the region, work is also being carried out on landscaping: workers are planting trees.
There are more than 700 ski resorts in the country, but only 20 of them are large enough to host international-level competitions.
Many areas of China where resorts are located, including Zhangjiakou, have snow problems.
The main long-term goal is to provide comfortable and interesting holidays in Chinese resorts, so that all newcomers become regulars.
But that's a long way off.
Justin Downs, an adviser to the organisers of the Games, says that since his last visit in 2007, the Chinese ski industry has changed beyond recognition.
Every year more and more Chinese go to the slopes in winter.
Fiona, a snowboarder from Beijing, is one of them.
Despite the major changes, it will take many more years to establish a ski culture here, says Downs.
Many resorts are located in agricultural and mining areas.
These regions have yet to be actively developed and the necessary infrastructure for recreation has yet to be created.
Gao Makong, 70, lives in Chungli, near the site of the Winter Olympics.
He notes that in recent years there has been a boom in winter sports tourism.
Two years ago, a high-speed railway was built from Beijing to Chungli, and now none of the local residents suffer from unemployment.
More and more shops selling winter sports clothing and equipment are opening in the country.
On the slopes open points of public catering with dishes of national cuisine.
Taiwan now even has a COVID-19 testing station.
China is striving to create a thriving winter sports industry, its athletes to become leaders in major international competitions, and its resorts and facilities to reach world-class standards.
More than 500 million people in the world could face extreme poverty due to the pandemic, says WHO
More than 500 million people worldwide could be pushed into extreme poverty due to the coronavirus pandemic, which has slowed humanity's progress towards universal access to health services, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank (WB) said.
Two complementary reports have been published by WHO and WHO to mark the International Day of Universal Health Coverage on 12 December.
In them, they stated that the pandemic has caused disruptions in the provision of medical services, causing excessive strain on health care systems.
As a result, immunization coverage decreased for the first time in 10 years, and deaths from tuberculosis and malaria increased.
WHO and WHO stressed that the pandemic had caused "the worst economic crisis since the 1930s, making it harder for people to pay for treatment".
This situation pushes more than 500 million people "into extreme poverty because they have to pay for these services out of their own pockets".
In October, UN Secretary-General AntÃ³nio Guterres stated that the coronavirus pandemic has pushed more than 100 million people into poverty, with more than four billion people virtually lacking social support.

Reuters: Taiwanese minister suspended from broadcast at "Democracy Summit" at White House request
Taiwan's Digital Minister Audrey Tan's speech at a panel discussion during the US-organized "Democracy Summit" was translated into non-video mode, according to a recording of the summit on YouTube.
Reuters, citing sources, claims that the image was disabled at the request of the White House.
According to them, the reason was a map on which Taiwan was highlighted in a separate color from the People's Republic of China, which considers the island its territory.
The map Ms. Tan was showing was compiled by the South African NGO CIVICUS and ranked the countries of the world according to their level of civil rights.
Taiwan was highlighted in green as "free", and the People's Republic of China, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Laos, and Vietnam were highlighted in red as "closed".
After the minister showed the map, the picture from her side was replaced with a screenshot with a note that the opinions of the participants in the discussion "do not necessarily reflect the position of the US government".
The PRC was not invited to the "Democracy Summit".
Reuters sources note that the map displayed by the Taiwanese minister may have run counter to Washington's "one China" policy.
One of the agency's sources said that after the map was shown, the US National Security Council angrily contacted the State Department, accusing it of depicting Taiwan as a separate country.
The Washington-organized "Summit for Democracy" was held from December 9 to 10 with the participation of representatives from 110 countries and territories, as well as civic associations and charitable organizations.
Russia wasn't invited to the summit.
During the "zero day" of the summit, Nobel Peace Prize laureate Dmitry Muratov, the editor-in-chief of Novaya Gazeta, called for the creation of an international fund through which money earned through corruption would be donated to charity.
Earlier today, Russian Deputy Security Council Secretary Yuri Averyanov said the summit was "anti-Russian and anti-Chinese".
You're given information like they're cooking a meal, and there's rotten meat everywhere, but actually the butcher keeps the last piece of meat.
Classic journalism is making news out of nothing.
Instead of boiling the meat, they boil the horns and hooves, producing a glue-like substance.
The finished product looks like a yellow semi-transparent strip with almost no smell and is as hard as plastic, used as natural gelatin.

The Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism of the State Council of the People's Republic of China issued a circular prescribing to strengthen the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic in cities where land crossing points are located in order to further prevent the importation of infection from abroad.
According to the circular, people leaving these cities must provide a negative COVID-19 nucleic acid test result within 48 hours of departure.
Those arriving in cities with land border crossings are required to take at least one COVID-19 nucleic acid test upon arrival.
The document states that these requirements will be in effect from the day the respective provincial-level administrative units define and publish the zones of these cities, until March 15, 2022.
In addition, it is noted that cities that have land-based checkpoints and that meet certain conditions may consider establishing buffer zones to prevent and control the COVID-19 epidemic within their jurisdiction.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs spoke about the "sad conclusion" in relations between Russia and the United States
Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov in an interview with Izvestia assessed the prospects of relations between Moscow and Washington.
He noted that the long journey of interaction has led to sad conclusions, and the problems between the two countries did not start yesterday.
There's some unilateral negative predictability, but as far as some of the prospects for improving the relationship, it's completely unpredictable.
It's a sad conclusion to a long journey that we've been on with this administration and with Trump and with Obama.
The problems did not start yesterday", the diplomat pointed out.
According to Ryabkov, the problems are related to the desire of the United States to impose approaches on Russia on many issues.
The deputy foreign minister added that he would not risk making optimistic predictions about the prospects of improving relations and would not expect a change in Washington's position.
He explained that with the exception of areas such as strategic stability and cybersecurity, there has been no progress.
At the same time, Russia calls on the United States to take a responsible approach to international security issues and hopes that the signals will be heard and the Americans will listen to common sense arguments.
Earlier, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said at a meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken that Moscow was ready to restore dialogue with the United States.
Virologist warns of the dangers of nasal COVID vaccination outside hospitals
People who have received the nasal COVID-19 vaccine may develop allergies and require medical attention, so the first vaccination sites should not be at airports or shopping malls.
This was reported to TASS by a virologist, a corresponding member of the Russian Academy of Sciences, the head of the laboratory of bionanotechnology, microbiology and virology of the Novosibirsk State University, Sergei Netesov.
It's easier to set up nasal vaccine stations in airports and shopping malls, but I would only do it in medical facilities in the first place.
The fact is that the likelihood of an allergic reaction to such a vaccine is small, but it is desirable that the person afterwards sit near the doctor's office.
Doctors have special sets of anti-allergic drugs that act literally in a minute or two, which is sometimes very necessary", Netesov said.
According to the virologist, it will be possible to consider vaccination in shopping centers when experience in the use of the drug is accumulated.
He also emphasized that when a nasal vaccine is used, it is important that it reaches the mucous membrane in the nasal cavity.
However, there is a chance that the vaccine will not reach its destination if the recipient with nasal congestion exhale after injection.

Lama, they say true believers make up the church.

But let no one say of himself, nor of those who believe as he does, that they alone are true believers.
Because if they can say that they are true believers, then surely others can say the same.

In the UK, 1239 cases of the omicron strain of coronavirus were recorded in one day - RT in Russian
1239 cases of infection with the new omicron strain of coronavirus were detected in the UK in 24 hours.
This is Sky News reporting.
In particular, 1,196 new cases of the omicron strain were reported in England, 38 people were infected with the new strain in Scotland and five in Northern Ireland.
The total number of cases of COVID-19 from the new strain in the UK has reached 3,137.
Earlier, scientists at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine made a pessimistic prediction that 75,000 people could die in England by April due to an outbreak of coronavirus caused by the Omicron strain.
Peskov warned about the suffering of Western countries that impose anti-Russian sanctions
Press Secretary of the President of the Russian Federation Dmitry Peskov commented on the possible introduction of anti-Russian sanctions in case of continuation of "aggressive actions" against Ukraine, including due to the alleged "invasion" of the country's territory.
"It is impossible to impose some restrictions against Russia and not experience suffering yourself", the official representative of the Kremlin said on the air of the TV channel "Russia 1".
Peskov claims that this is "understood by everyone in the world".
Earlier it was reported that the United States is considering the possibility of introducing anti-Russian sanctions in the energy sector as an extreme measure.
In addition, Washington and the European Union plan to impose restrictions that will be aimed at complicating the conversion of rubles into dollars in relation to Russian banks and the Russian Direct Investment Fund.
However, the head of Sberbank, Herman Gref, is convinced that this is impossible.

New Caledonians reject independence from France
According to the final results of the third referendum on the independence of New Caledonia, the overwhelming majority of participants refused to leave France.
This was reported by the French TV channel BFM.TV on December 12.
96.5% of voters voted against independence.
Independence from France was supported by 3.51% of the inhabitants of the archipelago in the South Pacific Ocean.
Cancelled 2.99% of the ballots.
The voter turnout on that day was very low: about 55% of the archipelago's inhabitants came to the polling stations.
According to experts, the low turnout is due to calls by separatists to abandon participation in the referendum due to the coronavirus.
Paris has refused to postpone the referendum.
In October 2020, residents of New Caledonia voted against independence from France in a referendum.
In 2018, a referendum on independence was already held in the region.
The majority of the inhabitants supported the archipelago being part of France.
New Caledonia is almost 20,000 kilometers from mainland France.
In 1853, France claimed New Caledonia as its possession.
About 270 thousand people live on the archipelago, the territory has a special administrative-territorial status.
There is a 1998 agreement between Paris and the administration of New Caledonia, according to which the region can hold a vote on its independence twice with a difference of two years.

The WHO is tentatively considering Omicron to be less dangerous than Delta.
The World Health Organization (WHO) is tentatively considering Omicron to be less dangerous than the Delta strain of the coronavirus.
However, there is some evidence that vaccines are less effective against the new COVID-19 variant.
As of December 9, Omicron has been detected in 63 countries.
"Preliminary data and a significantly altered antigenic profile of the omicron strain protein suggest a decreased effectiveness of the vaccine against infection and transmission of the variant.
Preliminary findings from South Africa suggest that it ("disease severity" - ed.) may be less less severe than that of "delta"", - stated in the WHO technical report.
The organization notes that so far, all reported cases of omicron infection in the EU have been mild or asymptomatic.
At the same time, the new strain, according to preliminary data, is spreading faster than "delta".
Two cases of contamination with the omicron strain have been reported in Russia.
They were "previously immunized", reported the Gamaleya Center.
The head of Rospotrebnadzor Anna Popova stated that there is no reliable data yet that the new variant of the coronavirus is less dangerous than the others.

Ukraine has named four scenarios for Zelensky
Ex-deputy of the Verkhovna Rada Vadim Denisenko listed four options for the development of events for President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky in 2022.
In his opinion, the head of state can remain without the support of the West, and also, perhaps, will compromise on the Donbass.
On Sunday, December 12, Denisenko told about this in a publication on the portal "Glavred".
The first, which Denisenko called a "perfect storm", suggests that key Western countries will stop supporting Ukraine by reaching an agreement on the country's future without its participation.
This development will contribute to the deep crisis that Kiev may face in 2023.
"In parallel, there is a decrease in prices for key goods that we traditionally export <...> internal protests and the confrontation of the authorities with key FPGs (financial and industrial groups. - Ed.) ", added the ex-parliamentarian.
According to Denisenko, there is another scenario - "war against all".
This forecast will come true in case of high turbulence in world politics, in which the Ukrainian authorities will face a number of problems.
Because of this state of affairs, the Ukrainian leadership may make compromises on the Donbas, which may lead to confrontation within the country.
At the end of the summer, Zelensky's position will weaken, the probability of such a situation, according to the former MP, is up to 50-55%.
The third variant of the development of the situation in Ukrainian politics is the confrontation of disagreeing groups of the population with Zelensky and the president, due to which the seizure of control over the power bloc and the implementation of "populist initiatives" is likely.
In the course of such a crisis scenario, Zelensky would begin a "reformatting of power", Denisenko added.
Another scenario is to turn Zelensky into the "father of the nation".
This may be triggered by an event that will cause a great upheaval in society.
"The event should be large enough to provoke a reaction from external partners and lead to an increase in support for Ukraine", Denisenko said.
Such a scenario is possible as a result of a natural disaster, a man-made disaster or Russia's aggressive actions, the ex-deputy believes.
At the same time, the Russian side has repeatedly rejected any possibility of an "attack" on Ukraine.
In Moscow, it was noted that it was the Ukrainian authorities, NATO and the United States that increased military activity near the Russian borders.
Earlier, on November 11, polling data from the sociological group Rating showed that the Ukrainian president's rating had fallen to a record low of 19.3%.
This is the lowest figure since he was elected head of state.
Analysts predicted a situation in which in the case of the upcoming presidential elections in Ukraine, only 21.8% would vote for Zelensky, while 14.5% would vote for the country's ex-president Petro Poroshenko.
At the same time, only 19.3% of all respondents expressed support for the president.

Thank you to the author for the story about the great athlete, I did not know that Elena Shushunova died, it is very sad to learn this.
I remember cheering for her at the Olympics in Seoul, and for us, the people of Primorye, it was live, real time.
So full of passion, the emotions were overwhelming, I remember the joy when Elena won.
They also rejoiced in the rest of the victories, as they cheered for Salnikov, for the footballers, for all the then Soviet athletes.
I once saw a documentary on TV about a Central American country where watermelons were rolled up the ladder of a ship like barrels.
The watermelons were monstrously large.
I myself worked many times as a young man on the harvesting and loading of watermelons in the Astrakhan region and never met a watermelon weighing more than a pod.
I buy four or five kilos of watermelon straight from the orchard and not before the beginning of August.

The bottom part of the cup is reinforced with an inelastic transparent cloth.
The lateral inner part of the cup, in the area of the seam of the braid, is reinforced with non-elastic fabric in the fold, without additional seams for comfort.
It's this element that keeps the lace from stretching.
The richness of the lace can be judged by the festoon along the neckline and under the breast.
The vertical skeletons on the side panels of the single-layer microfiber prevent the fabric from twisting at large sizes.
I really didn't like the article, it's mean, it's poisonous.

But right now, a lot of people like to tear people apart.

The poet arrested for the action on Red Square: "For a quote from Yevtushenko, 10 days are given, that's it, the power of poetry!"
Earlier this week, 21-year-old poet Alexander Volchenkov was arrested for ten days.
A student of the Higher School of Economics was detained in Red Square with a poster on which the hashtag #poÑÑÐ²ÑÐ¾ÑÑÐ¸ÑÐ±Ð¾Ð»ÑÑÐµÑÐµÐ¼Ð¿Ð¾ÑÑ was written.
This quote belongs to the writer Yevgeny Yevtushenko.
A protocol was drawn up on Alexander under an administrative article on repeated violation of the procedure for holding a public action.
He was first detained on January 23 in Pushkin Square, at a rally in support of Alexei Navalny.
"The goal was to attract attention to poetry in general, but now the interest in it, unfortunately, has been lost, to the decline of the general culture in Russia and also a small hope to inspire unknown poets to write their poems on the Internet under this hashtag", explains Alexander.
We contacted the young poet to find out the circumstances of his detention and to reveal the message of his message in more detail.
How were you treated by the police officers when you were arrested this time and before?
What did the department ask, how did they comment on your action?
This time the staff was more polite, detention maximized, polite, no matter how ridiculous it sounds in some context of the word.
On Pushkinskaya took the OMONovci and took it hard.
They asked the standard questions about motives.
When you heard it, basically, you looked at it either disapprovingly or sympathetically.
Except for the four-way monkey, everything was perfectly correct, but I knew what I was getting into.
And if, after this action, even a few people start writing their own poems under this hashtag, I'll spend the next 10 days in jail for good.
Maxim, according to protocol, in private, speak at least the language of the Tumba-Yumba tribe.
And at public and official events they speak in the language of those around them so that everyone understands what happened in the Bundestag on September 25, 2001, or in their native language through an interpreter.
It's protocol and nothing more, by the way, Angela Merkel speaks perfect Russian and still uses an interpreter.
And even at official events, the stenography is done in the old handwriting, and the stenographer does not have to know several languages.

Well, go on a tour for six months "to the Andes, then to Nepal".
Before that, turn all assets into liquid shares.
And sell those shares bit by bit by opening an account in any bank in the world.
Sell not in dollars, but in currencies less dependent on the U.S., like Swiss francs.
And then to file for divorce from America.
But that's not all that keeps Americans in the United States.
It's their belief that the U.S. is better than anywhere else that keeps them going.
That's how they're raised.

Researchers reveal how potatoes help in the fight against age-related disorders
Research has shown that potatoes are rich in vitamins and trace elements that help improve blood circulation and lower cholesterol levels.
It contains vitamins of group B, vitamin C, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, riboflavin, and folic and pantothenic acids.
All of these elements help the body's systems function.
In addition, potatoes help in the fight against age-related disorders.
Due to its high gelling content, it is beneficial for the gastrointestinal tract, and with regular use can also help in the prevention of hypertension and atherosclerosis.
However, to get the most benefit from root vegetables, it is better to stew or boil them rather than fry them in oil.
Earlier, The Daily Express warned that potatoes, like other foods with a high glycemic index, can be dangerous for diabetics.
These are carbohydrate foods that break down quickly into sugars, such as sugar, sugar-sweetened soft drinks, white rice, and white bread.
In early December, the newspaper "Kommersant" warned of a possible shortage of Russian table potatoes, noting a reduction in its production in private subsidiary farms and an increase in processing capacities.
According to market participants, the shortage of products at the moment can only replace imports.
Lostfilm, lordfilm and other pirates will be removed from Yandex.
Candidates for departure
In 2015, rights holders from the "RAEC/Media" cluster compiled a list of the 100 largest pirate sites on the Runet, and most of them have ceased to exist, says Karen Kazaryan, CEO of the Internet Research Institute.
But some - Kinogo, Lostfilm, Filmix - have managed to survive thanks in part to regular domain name changes, he adds.
For example, on Lostfilm, which is available in both Yandex and Google search results, you can watch pirated copies of the Netflix series "The Squid Game" and "Tenderness" directed by Anna Melikyan - the original series of Russia's largest video service ivi (part of AIV).
On Kinogo, which is also available in search engines, you can watch the animated novelty "Encanto", but judging by the quality of the video, it is a so-called screen (a pirated copy of the film shot in the cinema).
On Filmix, which can also be found through search engines, the series "Univers. 10 years later" of the TNT TV channel (part of "Gazprom-media") is available.

"This idea developed by the Poles" - it would be more correct to say that Poland only reworked the idea of 1776 for itself, but developed it quite effectively.

Dimax Micro Ultimate mattress, size 160 by 190
This is a Micro Ultimey orthopedic spring mattress.
The model is convenient in that it has two different softness surfaces  of high hardness and slightly more than average.
The product includes only high-quality and premium fillers, which have proven themselves exclusively from the best side.
Springs: In the center of the model is a block of independent springs "micropack".
This means that there are 2,000 coils per sleeping space that are completely autonomous.
It's how they work that gives them their unique point alignment.
The "Micropack" is the highest frequency of all the variety of Dimax spring blocks, so it has a pronounced orthopedic effect and is considered premium.
Fillers: At the top and bottom of the springs are combinations of layers of coir and natural latex.
The only difference is the order of the plates.
If one surface has latex, the other has coconut shell.
Such a tandem of fillers has long been considered a classic, since it gives the mattress not only orthopedic, but also anatomical properties.
If the collar provides proper support for the back, the latex gives the surface an adaptation to the human body.
The case: the model comes in a plain knitted Aloe Vera case.
At the customer's request, it can be made both removable and stationary.
The overall height of the product is  27 cm, the recommended load per sleeping place is  170 kg.

Estonian scientists will search for life on Venus
The Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in collaboration with the Tartu Observatory and other research institutions and companies, is preparing three space missions to Venus to search for signs of life in the atmosphere, Actual Camera reported Sunday.
The goal of the five-year missions is to assess the habitability of Venus' clouds and then search for life there.
For the project, Tartu scientists proposed tools to measure the acidity and oxygen content of Venus' clouds.
So far, it's been assumed that the clouds of Venus, the planet closest to Earth, are too acidic for life to exist, but it's likely that Venus was originally an Earth-like planet.
The third mission is to bring back a sample from Venus.
Let's say that if we find life there, the main question is whether it's similar to Earth or different.
If it's very similar, then it's obvious that terrestrial life didn't start on Earth.
If it is different, then it may be more likely that life originated on Earth", said Mihkel Pajusalu, head of the Estonian Venus Life Finder team.

The metaverse will change Russian business
The metaverse became a hot topic this fall when Mark Zuckerberg announced that Facebook would become Meta.
For the market, this event was an important signal: the largest player confirmed the development of a new format of digital interaction between people.
This means that businesses in Russia, as in the rest of the world, will invest in creating their own meta-universes and subsequently monetizing them.
The metaverse should be viewed as a continuation of objectively existing trends.
On the one hand, there's a pandemic trend towards remote collaboration, because people are tired of being disconnected and confined.
On the other hand, it is a consequence of the desire of businesses to develop ecosystems and adapt their operating models to them.
And the third is that they are a logical continuation of the trend of asset digitization, where any rights, securities, works of art and even money are going digital.
Anya, you're right, changing your diet is a conscious process.
When you start eating right, you don't want anything that's too fatty and unhealthy.
Of course, we'll have the traditional olivier and herring under the coat for the feast, but no one's forcing me to eat it all at once.
You can eat a spoonful, taste it, and that's it.
After all, it's really a ten-day weekend, and you can cook all kinds of delicious and healthy meals.

And after 5 quarter jumps, she ran out of gold.
And she also understands that four years before the next Olympics, she will not last, that is, she will never be an Olympic champion.
And anyone who hasn't been into sports or can't imagine all the circles of hell she's been through, don't fuck around.
A British economist couldn't give a forecast for 2022
British economist Jim O'Neill was unable to give a forecast for 2022 because he believes such attempts will fail.
That's what he wrote in an article for Project Syndicate.
The expert believes that the next year will be full of unpredictability and any trend can change the turnaround.
The most important factor remains the coronavirus pandemic, followed by inflation, he believes.
O'Neill also admitted that he doesn't know if the increase in commodity prices is temporary or not.
As the expert pointed out, even before the pandemic, it was clear that "the world of infinite generosity of central banks had outlived its usefulness" and it was time to return to a relationship where interest rates, taking inflation into account, would correlate with expected GDP growth rates.
O'Neill noted that in the context of the pandemic, the continuation of ultra-soft economic policies could, according to some experts, lead to a new spike in inflation.
In addition, attention should be paid to the issue of productivity growth, as well as increasing poverty levels and climate change, O'Neill summed up.
Earlier, the head of the global research department "Discovery of Investments" Mikhail Shulgin reported that positive expectations for the dollar exchange rate for 2022 remain, while the growth potential will be less significant.
Among the risks to the dollar's exchange rate, Shulgin cited the Fed's monetary policy, the dynamics of oil prices and fears against the backdrop of the coronavirus pandemic.
I have to say yes.
But the good news is, if you compare yourself to yourself, five years ago, there were fewer containers.
It's better now.
There is progress, but it's sluggish.
Another problem is that there are a lot of green initiatives in cities, but people don't know about them.
All the eco-taxis that take the trash out of the house.
Yeah, it's a common recycling facility. It's used by outcasts.
Rarely does anyone bring glass or metal in there.

Russians gave auto dealers about 4.5% of the country's GDP
According to the results of 10 months of 2021, Russians spent 2 trillion 784 billion rubles on buying new cars, which is 28% more than in the same period last year, according to statistical data from the Russian Automotive Market Research (NAPI) agency.
To understand the scale - approximately the same amount (about 3 trillion rubles) was spent by the state to support citizens and the economy during the coronavirus pandemic.
Last September, at a meeting of the heads of state of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, President Vladimir Putin said that this amount is comparable to more than 4.5% of the country's gross domestic product (GDP) for 2020.
Kia is the leading Korean brand in terms of revenues in the Russian market.
For 10 months of this year, he managed to sell cars worth 325.7 billion rubles, which is almost 24% more than a year earlier.
Kia's sister brand Hyundai's growth is even more significant - more than 35%, and the revenue from the sale of cars is estimated at 279.3 billion rubles.
This brand is also in the leading position in terms of increasing the weighted average price of the car - for a year at Hyundai it grew by almost 21%, to 1.94 million rubles - only Changan, Chery, Geely and Mercedes-Benz had a stronger price dynamic.
At the same time, sales volumes of Korean brands did not grow so significantly: according to the statistics of the committee of automakers of the Association of European Business in Russia, in quantitative terms, Kia sold 9.4% more cars over the same period than a year earlier.
Hyundai is up almost 12%.
Japan's Toyota closes the top three in terms of sales in monetary terms - Russians spent 275.5 billion rubles on cars of this brand in 10 months, which is 14% more than a year earlier.
The Japanese are followed by Mercedes-Benz with an indicator of 266.1 billion rubles (+ 75%) - the German premium brand has increased both the sales volume (by 37%) and the average price of the car (almost 28%, to 8.2 million rubles).
"Mercedes-Benz is simultaneously experiencing a good growth in sales and the weighted average price - more, for example, than BMW - hence the greater growth in financial capacity, - explained NAPI General Director Tatyana Arabadji. -
In terms of sales growth, Chinese brands are showing fantastic performance, having also significantly increased their financial capacity this year".
The Russian Lada in the dynamics of income growth demonstrates average market indicators (plus 28%), on cars of this brand Russians spent for 10 months 229,4 billion rubles.
At last year's level of financial capacity are companies whose car sales in units in 2021 fell: in particular, Volkswagen, Mitsubishi and Nissan.
UAZ and all in the minus - for 10 months the Russians spent on SUVs and pickups of this brand 12 billion rubles against 12,4 billion rubles a year earlier.
Against the backdrop of problems with the supply of auto components and disruptions in production, covering the entire global auto industry, auto companies continue to continuously adjust prices - the same "AvtoVAZ" increased the cost of Lada models seven times a year, the last increase (by 8-10 thousand rubles) occurred at the end of November.
Price lists for their products and those of other automakers are regularly updated.
The volume of Russia's automobile market in monetary terms will continue to increase - in addition to the shortage of cars, inflation is contributing to this, as well as the desire of car companies to make up for past losses, experts believe.
In the face of the car shortage, I think many car companies have even been able to pass on to the consumer some of the costs of past periods that they couldn't put into the price of cars before.
This is VTB Capital's automotive analyst Vladimir Bespalov.
I think financially, the automakers are doing very well right now, maintaining high sales margins".
An indirect indicator of this is the rate of increase in the cost of cars, which is observed during 2021, the prices of new cars are rising faster than inflation, the expert specifies.
In the long term, the market will grow in both quantitative and monetary terms, but mainly due to inflation and the complexity of the design of the machines themselves, predicts Bespalov.
As supply increases, opportunities for price increases will be limited.
In monetary terms, the Russian car market will continue to grow in the coming year, even if the growth of car prices slows down, car manufacturers will be able to get their income from volumes, says independent consultant for the automotive industry Sergey Burgazliev.
Given increased demand and insufficient supply, automakers are now seeking to maximize profits from each car sold, says Burgazliev. -
Production volumes are not expected to increase for at least the next six months, with Russia's excitement fueled by citizens' uncertainty about the future.
Against the background of the current market situation, cars have turned out to be a good object for investment - a car bought a year ago, even with mileage, can now be sold for more than its original value, the expert states.
Biden spoke about sending U.S. troops to Ukraine in case of Russian invasion
The U.S. leadership has never considered sending American troops to Ukraine in the event of a Russian "invasion".
U.S. President Joe Biden made the announcement.
"There have never been such plans", the White House chief said, answering a reporter's question about whether the United States had abandoned such an idea.
Biden noted that if the situation around Ukraine escalates, Russia will face economic consequences.
At the same time, he stressed that the US and NATO have no obligation to use military force to protect Ukraine in the event of an escalation.
The American leader also stated that the possibility of using American troops unilaterally for the defense of Ukraine is not on the agenda.
Biden explained that if Russia invades the territory of Ukraine, the US will transfer forces to the Eastern European countries of NATO (Bulgaria, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Estonia).
"We will have to send more American and NATO troops to the eastern flank, B9 - all those NATO countries that we have a sacred obligation to defend against any attack from Russia", Biden said.
Earlier, the press secretary of the President of Russia Dmitry Peskov stressed that Moscow has no intention to invade the territory of Ukraine.
At the same time, he pointed out that Moscow sees a problem in the combat use of Kiev's drones supplied by Turkey, as well as in the fact that "American weapons are approaching our territory".
I don't do interviews like this anymore.
If I'm on a job interview and they want me to listen to the screams, wait for hours, drink the booze I don't understand and wash the cup, it's scary to think about what's going to happen at work.
I'm gonna find myself a normal place, without the eyeshadow layer, where you talk to the supervisor straight away.

If a fraudster calls from such a number, such as an "employee of the Ministry of Internal Affairs" or another law enforcement agency, it is ineffective to dismiss immediately, and it is unlikely to be blacklisted in time.
Because to confirm his lie of involvement in power structures, he quickly repeats the challenge and continues to intimidate and persuade.
We need more useful recommendations for the people.
This is bullshit.
I can't believe this happened.
They don't know what to think anymore, who to blame.
We've reached the Queen.
And most importantly, they think it's everybody's fault except for the very, very...

As shown by the regular friendly meetings of the presidents of Russia, Azerbaijan, Turkey, I think you are, to put it mildly, off topic.
Just yesterday, the President of Azerbaijan approved the opening of a joint Azerbaijani-Russian enterprise KamAZ.
