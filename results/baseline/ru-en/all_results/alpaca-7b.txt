From my perspective, the program was formed by the ladies of the Balzac era based on their interests.
From 19th century Russian literature, we preferred Danilevsky and Volkov.
They wrote belletristick, of course, from the point of view of those same damsels of the Balzacian age.

Germany: The fourth vaccination against COVID-19 is inevitable.
The fourth vaccination is needed either in the summer or fall of 2022.
According to the expert, the current vaccination in Germany will not be the final one, but will continue with renewed strength.
Despite the active vaccination campaign in Germany, it is likely that two or three doses of the coronavirus vaccine will not be enough to provide full protection.
Ulrich Weigelt is the leader of the Association of General Practitioners.
This is reported by Die Welt on Saturday, December 11th.
We expect that the fourth vaccination will be needed this summer, the latest by fall, according to an expert.
Besides, Wegeldt hopes that the fourth vaccination against coronavirus can be conducted "in combination with the vaccination against the flu".
This will help achieve the best results.
In addition, boosted vaccination may help in the fight against the spread of the new coronavirus "Omicron".
However, the new variant is particularly dangerous.
Yes, the probability of reinfection with "Omicron" is three times higher than with the Delta or Beta strains.
This is corroborated by the results of the preliminary research conducted in South Africa.
Based on this, BioNTech / Pfizer plan to provide a vaccine adapted for Omikron by March 2022.
Companies emphasize that two doses of the vaccine do not provide sufficient protection against the new variant of the coronavirus "Omicron".
The study by BioNTech and Pfizer showed that the efficacy is significantly reduced by more than 25 times.
This indicates that two doses of BNT162b2 do not provide sufficient protection against infection with the omicron strain, emphasized BioNTech and Pfizer.
Because it is necessary to take a third dose.
Experts insist on speeding up the vaccination process in the country.
For example, President of the German Society of Infectious Diseases, Bernhard Zoller, advocates for shortening the interval between the second and third vaccination.
Moreover, according to Salzberger, accelerated vaccination will have an impact on the spread of both delta-virus and omicron-variant coronavirus.
The expert emphasized that Israel's experience is very convincing.
Whistle Pontoon21, Bet-A Vib, 54 Silent, 54 mm, 8.5 g.
Bet-A-Vib is a unique branch of the Bet-A family from Pontoon21®.
She (as well as the Kalikana Vib series) distinguishes itself from other vibes by being originally designed for ice fishing, rather than just general fishing.
These vibes have a greater, than their closest analogues, weight ratio, which undoubtedly affects the nuances of their application.
Another recognizable feature – the upper lip of rigid and elastic plastic, creating additional tones of vibration when vertical and horizontal conduction.
As "winter vibes" Bet-A-Vib demonstrates quite aggressive play.
It is often the simplest animations that are the most catching, such as the up-and-down motion of a pendulum with hardly any pauses.
When planning the deviation from the vertical axis is not very great, which is convenient when fishing in a restricted space, cluttered with weeds, kelp and other obstructions, it is possible to hook.
Besides, a small deviation from the actual catching of winter suckers and large pike, especially in the middle of winter, when precise and aggressive baiting is required.
Reached the end of the trajectory, Bet-A-Vib immediately reverses course and returns to its original vertical.
Bet-A-Vib is also used for winter fishing for pike-perch.
To please her caprices, you can choose between two modifications: with a noise suppressor (NS – NanoSound) or without it (SL – Silent).
It is noted that Bet-A-Vib can irritate a passive fish, even one that does not react to stimuli.
Bet-A-Vib demonstrates range and accuracy.
This watch is understandable and elegant, it goes well with leather and braided straps, even of large diameters.
For catching pike, perch, chub or crucian carp, a step bait, sometimes with a jigging motion, is also effective.
If you catch fish in snagged places, you can switch to a double hook, which will reduce the likelihood of snags.
Bet-A-Vib is among the most reliable members of its class and, as a result, one of the most catchable.
It can be used with equal success on both shallow and deep areas.
All models come with ST-36 nuts.

In Libya, it was reported that there are 7,000 Russian mercenaries.
In Libya, there are over 7,000 mercenaries from the private military company "Wagner".
Haled al-Mishri, the president of the Supreme Council of the Republic, announced this on Sunday, December 12th.
In Libya, there are currently over 7,000 mercenaries from the Wagner private military company.
They have planes as well.
They also dig trenches in Syrte and Kufra.
They have 30 reactive aircraft at the Ghardabiya airbase (which is also used as a civilian airport in Sirte), - reports Anadolu Agency.
Haled al-Mishri also said that Russian mercenaries are "trying to seize" the central part of Libya, stretching from Chad to the Mediterranean, after they "bring their man" to power in the Central African Republic.
Save presence.
According to the interviewee, Moscow was looking for a country to maintain its presence in North Africa and "settled" in Libya.
Wagner has been in Libya since 2019, using an airbase and port in Sirte, as well as an airbase in Derna, noted by the agency.
The Russian government officially denies that the Wagner Group is receiving support from the Kremlin.
Where can I find freelancers?
According to the agency, "Wagner" is allegedly active in nine countries in Africa - CAR, Libya, Sudan, Mozambique, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Madagascar, Zimbabwe and Angola.
The company provides military training for local forces, personal protection for leaders and defense of energy objects.
In exchange for these services, "Wagner" subsidiaries receive certain privileges and licenses to use valuable resources, as well as the supply of weapons, technologies and military services to these countries, as stated in the article.
According to media reports, the Wagner Group allegedly fought in the Donbas, Syria, Mozambique, Sudan and CAR.
This group is not registered in the military or civilian authorities, and its members are not listed in any official rosters.
This company is under US sanctions.
We remind that 27 countries of the EU approved restrictions against "Wagner".
It is expected that the Council of Europe will approve this decision on December 13th.
The situation in Libya.
The Supreme Council of Libya de facto is the second chamber of the parliament with consultative functions, dominated by Islamists, reports TASS.
This organ repeatedly called for the postponement of the parliamentary elections and the presidential election at least until February 2022.
There are less than two weeks until the election, and the chances of it happening on time are rapidly diminishing, according to the material.
The High Election Commission of Libya has postponed the announcement of the final list of candidates, according to Sky News Arabia.

The main failures - "conflict with Ukraine", "confrontation with western countries", "isolation from the world" - is said in the study by the Foundation "Public Opinion".
The government of Dubai has completely abandoned paper-based workflow and all government services are now digital.
The Government of Dubai announced its complete abandonment of paper-based processes and transition to digital technologies.
All government services will be provided to the population exclusively in electronic form.

The production and export of cars in Turkey fell below the level of 2020.
The production and export of cars in Turkey drastically decreased in November due to the devaluation of the lira.
As a result, the industry's performance for the 11-month period was worse than last year's, according to Bloomberg, citing data from the Association of Automotive Manufacturers of Turkey.
According to the association, in November in Turkey, 115 thousand cars were released from the factories, which is 20% less than last year.
Approximately 75,9 thousand machines were sent for export, which is more than 25% below the previous year's figure.
If the first 10 months of the year in Turkey showed a positive dynamics compared to the previous year, then the output of cars in the 11th month of 2021 was 0.3% worse than the previous year.
The reason for this fall was a sharp weakening of the Turkish lira, which in November fell by 29% in relation to the dollar.
This led to a decrease in economic activity in all sectors.
More than 500 entities received an extension on their credit payments in 2021.
The First Deputy Prime Minister Alihan Shamirov spoke about the situation regarding the provision of benefits to small and medium businesses, reports correspondent MIA "Kazinform".
According to the Republic of Kazakhstan's Agency for the Regulation and Development of the Financial Market, on April 1, 20

Pulmonologist Pyraev hypothesized that people with weak immunity can easily contract the "okmion" strain.
The doctor suggested that people with weakened immunity may be able to tolerate it easier than those with a strong immune response.
Pulmonologist Sergey Pushasev explained why the coronavirus "Okemyon" may be dangerous.
The cause should be sought in the conditions of the virus's origin.
Scientists believe that "okmion" originated in the body of an infected person or one suffering from immunodeficiency.
That is, with mutation he encountered no resistance from immunity.
Because of this, he is more aggressive.
Because there was no response from immunity, he became very fast.
It appears that there may be more spikes, scales, and possibly even more antibodies than usual, comments pulmonologist Sergey Pushasev.
The doctor suggested that people with weakened immunity may be more susceptible to "okmilon" than those with a strong immune response.
It appears that a strong response by the body to anything, including infections, - is not always good.
In such cases, the organism may kill itself.
This can happen with pneumococcal infections, when the young adults in their 30s die, while the elderly in their 60s are merely suffering from a bad cold.
Immune response inappropriate for his age: there, where one could only threaten with a finger, he beats like a cannon on the birds - concluded Sergey Pushasev.
The doctor reminded that coronavirus has dangerous side effects, the worst of which is pneumonia.
Pneumonia can be bacterial or viral.
If the first treatment is successful and quick, in the second case, one can only hope to control the symptoms - there is no guarantee for a full recovery.
The first sign of developing pneumonia will be fever, weakness, and fatigue.
Then come the respiratory symptoms: difficulty breathing, a sore throat, and coughing.
Pain on the right or left, abdominal pain can also be a sign of a developing problem.
Meanwhile, in Russia, the next generation can begin to be vaccinated from 12 to 18 years old.
Virologist Pavel Volchkov noted that this category is very actively suffering from COVID-19.

Immunologists proposed a hypothesis why people with obesity become victims of COVID.
The authors of the study examined the remaining fat tissue from bariatric operations and discovered that fat cells, known as adipocytes, can be infected with the coronavirus.
Immune cells located in fat tissue, macrophages, also became infected, demonstrating a strong inflammatory reaction.
Scientists also studied the fat tissue of patients who died from COVID and found particles of the coronavirus surrounding various organs.
It is known that viruses such as HIV and the flu can hide in fatty tissue, using it as a reservoir, in an attempt to evade the body's immune system.
It is likely that SARS-CoV-2 is capable of this.
The biologist told the reasons for the appearance of dementia.
Candidate of Biological Sciences Semen Goloshikin named the causes of dementia and described ways of its prevention in an interview with radio Sputnik.
According to WHO, this disease affects more than 55 million people.
The syndrome manifests itself as a gradual deterioration of cognitive functions - with time, even a familiar environment becomes difficult to orient.
Goloshekin noted that the most common causes of dementia are neurodegenerative disorders, head injuries, certain infections, metabolic abnormalities, and vitamin deficiencies.
Some factors increase the risk of developing the disease.
This includes hypertension, diabetes, high cholesterol, obesity, depression, and alcoholism.
At a behavioral level, factors such as social isolation and lack of active cognitive activity, - he said.
Smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, poor sleeping habits and a sedentary lifestyle can also contribute to dementia.
Among the first signs the expert noted was forgetfulness, inability to concentrate, and a decrease in abstract thinking.
It was noted by a biologist that hearing loss can be both an early sign of Alzheimer's disease and a risk factor for its occurrence.
To prevent the occurrence of the disease, WHO recommends maintaining the necessary level of hygiene, training cognitive skills and abilities requiring involvement of memory and logic.
Previously, the professor of the department of neurology, neurosurgery and medical genetics of FGOU VO RNIMU was.
Anna Bogolepova, head of the department of cognitive disorders at the Federal Center for Brain and Neurotechnology, spoke about the causes of memory problems.

Christie's auction house held an auction on July 4th, at which a bust estimated to be over 3,000 years old was sold for $5.97 million (approximately 680 million rubles).
This caused dissatisfaction from Egypt.
The Egyptian side also claims that the artifacts were illegally removed from the Karnak Temple in Luxor in the 1970s.
The head of Tutankhamun, depicted as the god Amon, had been kept in a private collection and had not been put up for sale since 1985.
How the relic ended up in Europe is unknown.
Egypt is actively seeking the repatriation of illegally exported ancient artifacts from the country at various times.
According to authorities, 95% of contraband antiquities is a result of illegal excavations by "black diggers".
This is correct, as the Crimean Tatars (232,000) are a distinct people closely related to the Turks.
If you want to add, then 42 thousand people - so many Tatars (Kazan) live in Crimea (see census).
The Crimean Tatars are a distinct people, and their name is composed of two words!
They are united by the Turkic language group.
Credit Suisse wants to access the personal mobile devices of its employees.
Credit Suisse requires its employees to provide the bank access to their personal mobile devices, according to the Financial Times.
The issue is that in Europe and the United States, the Swiss bank does not provide its employees corporate devices, instead offering a discount on the purchase of a mobile phone or a smartphone from a communications operator partner.
According to the rules, the bank may access information on corporate devices issued to its employees, as they are used to solve business issues with colleagues or clients.
Credit Suisse may use the right to check mobile devices in extreme cases, for example, if an employee used it to conduct a meeting with a client that was not approved by Credit Suisse.
Now that many employees have switched to remote work, the bank wants to extend this rule to all devices that were used to solve work-related issues.
According to the newspaper, the bank has set a deadline for employees to familiarize themselves with the new rule.
Credit Suisse is not commenting on the new requirement.

Part 4
The last year of Sergey Esenin's life, 1925, was productive in terms of his creativity, but it was a difficult year for him in terms of his earthly existence and his "ego".
He is not affiliated with any literary movements, but he is well-known, sought after, and sometimes harshly criticized by critics, yet the reading public is willing to carry him in their hands.
Last year, over 60 poems were written, many of them masterpieces, the Persian Motifs cycle was completed, the poem "Anna Snegina" was published, and 8 books were released.
The main success - on June 25th, 1925, Gosizdat concluded a contract with Esenin to publish his works in three volumes.
No one among the contemporary poets accorded Sergei Alexandrovich the honor he deserved, he was the first!
In addition, it was very good money - the bonus was 1000 rubles per month for 20 months (the director, for example, received 300 rubles per month, an engineer - 200).
The resources that year were needed as never before.
Esenev married Sofia Tolstaya, the granddaughter of Leo Tolstoy, and had to set up a family life, take care of his sisters Katya and Sasha, and his mother-in-law.
Life was slowly getting back to normal, but everything was colored mostly in dark tones, like a nightmare from the poem "The Black Man" (written in November 1925 and published after his death).
My friend, my friend.
I am very ill.
I don't know where this pain came from.
Does the wind blow?
Over a deserted and empty field.
As the leaves fall in September.
Alcohol causes dizziness.
Many acquaintances noted that Esenin looked very ill, clearly suffering.
Repetitions and nervous breakdowns are more common.
The cause is likely not only due to alcoholism...
If such a diagnosis - alcoholism - was placed on Sergey Alexandrovich, authentic documents remain.
We shall say that in May 1923, when Esenin was advised by his fourth wife, American Aisadora Duncan, to improve his health in a clinic in Paris under the guidance of Professor Petr Gannushkin (two years later, Esenin will return to him in Moscow).
Here are the poet's testimonies, scandals on this ground are enough to fill dozens of memoirs.
The poet's terrifying romance with the green snake rapidly developed in the early 20th century.
In the summer of 1923, Esenin stayed with his friend, the artist Ivan Starcev.
It was surprising that, despite his relatively low income, Esenin never had his own home in either Moscow or St. Petersburg. He had to rely on renting apartments, staying in hotels or staying with friends.
Starcev remembers.
He usually came only to sleep, and in most cases in an incomprehensible, drunk state.
One evening, returning home at four o'clock in the morning, Esenin fell on the staircase...
He was shivering and rubbing his face as he fell.
When he came to himself, he kept coughing up blood non-stop.
And Esenin confessed: "After his travels around Europe and the United States (when Prohibition was in effect in the States, but Duncan brought along a respectable supply of spirits).
I saw nothing but cabarets and streets...
I have almost forgotten...
Yes, I drank, of course...
I drank because I was feeling lonely.

The European Union previously implemented the fifth package of sanctions against Belarus.
He touched 17 physical persons and 11 organizations.
In Europe, they announced their readiness to expand restrictive measures against the republic, "if the situation in the country does not improve".
Minsk has responded by introducing a food embargo on a wide range of goods from countries that had previously decided to impose sanctions against Belarus.

When a man wears a fur hat, it makes people laugh.
At events in 2021, velvet blazers were dominant.
Daniel Craig was the first person to announce their new fashion solution.
In September, he appeared at the premiere of the film "Not Time to Die" wearing a black velvet blazer and a traditional "Bond girl" hat.
After his example, Prince William first put on the Earthshot Prize ceremony an inappropriate green velvet blazer, but then chose a more classical option for the charity event Royal Variety.

The most popular warm, velvet blazers with padding and tailored silhouette, colors - dark brown, burgundy, navy and, of course, black.
The average price of these models is from 3 to 6 thousand rubles. Men prefer to buy exclusively blazer sets - leather suits they choose less often.

A black tailored blazer is ideal for any evening occasion, whether you're attending a party or a formal event, - explains Vakhshin. - It will also fit the bill if the invitation specifies a "Black Tie" or "Creative Black Tie" dress code.
Another important criterion, adherence to which allows one to make a choice in favor of a Baroque-style blazer, is the status of the buyer.
A man in a velvet blazer, first and foremost, should acquire a proper tailored suit with enough style, - believe the authors of the Telegram channel "Handsome Bramwell". - Owners of velvet blazers, as a rule, belong to the caste of people who rarely buy tickets.
They are invited to the related social events, where the dress code is always specified.
Ilya Vakhshinks offers to combine a tweed jacket with such accessories: classic dress shoes with laces, single-colored blazers, woolen sweaters, silk ties, and cufflinks.
Simple and everyday things will look out of place.
The fashion experts from "Brammell" are sure that it will be inappropriate for a regular employee to show up at the corporate event in a velvet blazer, but if it's the CEO who is in charge, then it's a different story.
If the goal is to move up the hierarchy or to earn financial bonuses, it is better not to wear a tailored suit.
The editors of the Telegram channel estimate that the phrase "without a cap" is fashionable for men.
Very ambiguous feelings from the voice.
This is an unnatural tone, it drags so heavily.
He does not associate at all with the pleasant face of a young girl.
If I'm honest, I don't understand the admiration of those around me.

I didn't see any beautiful people in the article.
The mediocrity within the average passenger.
It is possible that if such characters are so confident in their beauty that they decide to show it off, then no one will be able to resist them, probably.
Only because of their mental illness and lack of education, these "beauties" (-ies) are not judged by their appearance.
Kazbek, "a slave who is aware of his servile condition and striving to overcome it, is a revolutionary."
The slave, who is unaware of his servitude and languishing in a silent, unconscious, and mute servile life, is simply a slave.
The slave, whose sweat drips as he describes the pleasures of servitude and gushes over his benevolent and good master, is a slave, a villain.
Immunologist said that revaccination after 4-5 months will help protect against the coronavirus "Omicron".
Vaccination after four-five months may protect against the new coronavirus infection "Omicron".
Immunologist Nikolay Kryuchkov stated that vaccination six months after the appearance of the new strain is "very long".
When the previous strains of the virus were present, it was best to conduct the procedure five months ago, but for people with chronic illnesses, it is recommended to get revaccinated four weeks ago.
Kruchkov also noted that early revaccination provides a good titer of neutralizing antibodies.
If a person has had two vaccines and a booster, or if they have had the flu and been vaccinated, or have been vaccinated and then gotten the flu, they have "hybrid immunity", meaning they have antibodies from both the vaccine and the flu, which is enough to protect them.

We, the ministers of Foreign Affairs of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the European Union, are united in our condemnation of Russia's military buildup and aggressive rhetoric towards Ukraine, as expressed in the joint statement.
The ministers are calling on Russia to "de-escalate, use diplomatic channels and abide by its international obligations regarding transparency in military activities," as President Biden mentioned during his video call with President Putin on December 7th.
We confirm our support for France and Germany's efforts in the Normandy format for the full implementation of the Minsk agreements to resolve the conflict in eastern Ukraine, also stated the foreign ministers of the "Big Seven".
The use of force to change borders is prohibited by international law.
Russia should not doubt that further military aggression against Ukraine will have immense consequences and serious costs, warn they.
We confirm our unshakable loyalty to Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity, as well as the right of any sovereign state to determine its own future.
We welcome a cautious stance by Ukraine.
We will intensify our cooperation in response to our common and comprehensive answer, - said in the statement.
The British Foreign Secretary, Elizabeth Truss, said that Russia will face "serious consequences" if it invades Ukraine.

Pfizer considered the vaccine to be 32 times less effective than the Omikron strain.
The efficacy of the Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus vaccine is 32 times lower than other types of illness.
Researchers from the University of Hong Kong and Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, as reported by South China Morning Post (SCMP).
The efficacy of the vaccine was found to be lower based on the study of anti-viral activity among citizens, who received two doses of the COVID-19 vaccine.
Most people had a high level of antibodies against the original Sars-CoV-2 variant, but this ability was significantly reduced against the Omicron variant, according to Professor Malik Peiris.
Researchers emphasized that vaccination remains the most effective way to protect against serious complications of the virus.
Previous research from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine predicted the development of the COVID-19 pandemic, taking into account the influence of the omicron variant.
The authors of the study concluded that omicron variant may cause a new wave of circulation of the virus and an increase in mortality if no additional measures are taken.
The Ministry of Defence of Ukraine has accused Germany of blocking the supply of weapons to Kyiv from NATO.
The Minister of Defense of Ukraine, Alexei Kravchenko, accused the government of former Chancellor Angela Merkel of blocking the acquisition of deadly weapons by Kyiv within the framework of NATO.
In an interview with the Financial Times on December 12, Rезников reminded that in the past month Germany imposed a veto on the purchase of Ukraine anti-sniper systems and rifles to defeat drones.
This is noted that later Berlin softened its position regarding rifles, acknowledging them as non-lethal weapons.
According to the defense minister, Kyiv intends to acquire the mentioned weapons as part of bilateral agreements with allies.
In particular, it is about the United States, Great Britain, Lithuania and France.
Meanwhile, FT notes that the new German government led by Chancellor Olaf Scholz's position on arms supplies to Ukraine remains unclear.
The Ukrainian ambassador to Germany, Andrei Melnyk, expressed the opinion that Kyiv should not expect weapons deliveries from Berlin while Chancellor Scholz is in charge.
According to him, the previous German government explained its refusal to provide weapons by the risk of military escalation in the Donbas, despite "occupation" of part of Ukrainian territory.
The diplomat is confident that Germany will maintain the same "illogical" position.
In August, Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky announced that Kyiv is expecting assistance from Berlin in equipping its naval fleet.
They are counting on Germany to be their technical partner, President Zelensky said.
It was noted that this spring, the co-chair of the German Green Party, Robert Habeck, visited the republic, where he spoke in favor of the sale of defensive weapons to Kyiv.

Scholz arrived in Poland to discuss the "Nord Stream-2" and EU legislation.
Newly elected Chancellor of Germany Olaf Scholz arrived in Warsaw for talks on the migrant crisis at the Polish-Belarusian border, the independence of the judicial authority in Poland, and the increase of Russian troops near Ukraine's borders and the situation with the Russian gas pipeline "Nord Stream-2".
Although Schulz had stated his desire to preserve good relations between Germany and Poland for many years, the leaders of the two countries expressed ambiguous expectations from each other.
The Prime Minister of Poland Mateusz Morawiecki announced that he will be calling on Scholz to oppose "Nord Stream 2", which is intended to deliver Russian gas to Germany via Ukraine.
According to Moravcek, Russia can use the gas pipeline as a tool of political pressure against Europe.
In turn, Germany supported Poland's efforts to stop the flow of migrants, who are trying to enter the country from Belarus.
Berlin announced that it would help Warsaw and Brussels to resolve this crisis.
The judicial system of Poland, however, remains one of the sources of disagreements.
The European Court fined Poland, finding that the judicial reforms implemented by the right-wing party "Law and Justice" violated EU law.
Poland refused to pay the fine, and its highest court ruled that its national legislation takes precedence over EU rules.
The new German government, sworn in on Wednesday, despite the demands of Poland and the United States, did not take on any public obligations to halt "Nord Stream-2" in the event of a Russian invasion of Ukraine.
American officials told members of Congress that they had reached an understanding with Germany that the gas pipeline would be halted if Russia invades Ukraine, according to a high-ranking Congressional source.
German officials have not confirmed these reports, but Scholz warned on Wednesday about the consequences if Russia violates Ukraine's border, and this position was confirmed by representatives of the "Big Seven" on Sunday.

In Brazil, citizens are required to present proof of vaccination upon entering the country.
In Brazil, visitors are required to present a COVID-19 passport upon entering the country, as decided by the Federal Supreme Court (STF) Luis Roberto Barroso.
This is reported by CNN Brazil.
People with contraindications to vaccination have been released from the obligation to present a certificate of vaccination.
People who have arrived from countries where proof of vaccination is lacking are also included in the exclusion list.
The situation is even more serious if you consider that Brazil is a popular tourist destination for New Year's, pre-Carnival and carnival celebrations, as well as other events, which implies an increase in tourist traffic.
Previously, the government of Brazil ordered unvaccinated tourists to observe a five-day quarantine.
The full scheme for protecting against COVID-19 has been revealed.
Virologist, Doctor of Medical Sciences, Honored Scientist of Russia Anatoly Altshtein in an interview with Ura.ru revealed the scheme of complete protection from coronavirus infection.
According to him, this can be achieved through the introduction of injections and the use of nasal vaccines.
When administered intramuscularly, antibodies A are produced in large amounts. When vaccines are injected, this does not occur.
Antibodies A protect the mucous membrane, so the virus cannot penetrate the body.
After vaccination, we have the most amount of immunoglobulins G (antibodies).
If you introduce both vaccines, you will receive many antibodies A and G. But there is no consensus on double vaccination, - said the doctor.
The main prophylactic of the Ural Federal District, Doctor of Medical Sciences Sergey Tokarev, in turn, stated that the main advantage of nasal vaccination combined with injection is the possibility of becoming a non-carrier of COVID-19.
He added that it would help in such a case that the defense of the organism should be maximized.
The Minister of Health of the Nizhny Novgorod region, David Melik-Guseynov, stated that the next wave of the COVID-19 pandemic will be caused by the spread of the new coronavirus among children.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has already detected "omicron" in several countries.
The World Health Organization (WHO) announced that the new coronavirus "Omicron" has been detected in 63 countries.
Several experts have already warned that the spread of the new strain could have catastrophic consequences.
The speed of the spread of the virus was reported in a WHO communication.
According to the organization, the virus has been detected in 63 countries, in all six WHO regions.
That is why it began to spread only from November.
The World Health Organization is concerned about the rapid spread of the new coronavirus variant.
Experts from the World Health Organization express concern that the new strain of the virus, based on preliminary data, may exceed the spread of the "Delta" strain, which is the Indian variant of the coronavirus, which is leading in all countries without exception.
The World Health Organization's Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus announced that the Omicron variant could have a significant impact on the course of the COVID-19 pandemic.
In Britain also came to similar conclusions.
Experts from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine believe that "omicron" will replace "delta" in the near future.
Approximately one million people in Britain will be infected with the virus, while the official count currently stands at a few hundred people, with estimates of up to 10,000.
British experts predict tens of thousands of deaths from the "omicron" strain, with peak hospital admissions of over 2,000 people per day.
The British healthcare system will not be able to deal with the situation.
The situation is complicated by the fact that according to the latest studies, the efficacy of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine against the "omicron" strain is 32 times lower than compared to other types of illness.
It is not yet known how the Russian satellite "Sputnik V" will react - this will become clear in the next few weeks.
The Gamalei Center has just started testing the Russian vaccine on the "omicron" strain.

The Russians warned about a new scam.
Scammers are looking for new ways to cheat people through video messages.
This is reported by "Izvestia" with a reference to experts.
According to Ivideon's Director of Products, Zaura Abutalimova, the main danger associated with the spread of video communication tools is diphthongs.
In this case, fraudsters create a fake video based on real recordings involving the victim.
Thanks to this neural network, it is possible to accurately reproduce the characteristics of a person's behavior.
Abutalimov added that using deepfakes, criminals can call their victims via video chat or create a video with a likeness of the person for the purpose of extortion.
Such manipulations are easily provoked by a malicious person who can put people in ridiculous, dangerous or compromising scenarios, - said the expert.
Systems Engineer Vetokl Alexander noted that people tend to trust each other more when they see them.
He emphasized that this could create specific risks when dealing with technologies involving video.

Listed are five actions that can help avoid sugar diabetes.

Doctor Pavlova told the story of "Migraine Day" to the students.
To worsen one's mood on weekends can be attributed to several factors.
The cause of worsened mood after busy workdays is often "the hangover of the weekend", according to an endocrinologist, a candidate of medical sciences, and the senior scientific collaborator of the Faculty of Fundamental Medicine of the MGU.
According to them, especially often suffer from migraines, which are accompanied by a headache, dizziness and weakness.
Doctor Pavlova noted that aside from the accumulated fatigue from the week, there are plenty of objective reasons for a negative reaction of the body to the changed conditions.
On weekends, our lives are drastically changed.
We lie around all day, probably drinking more, but drinking less coffee, which leads to a small breakdown.
Because of overeating and lack of water - heaviness and weakness.
Additional roles are played by a late rise.
If you wake up three hours later than usual, you will experience a reaction known as jet lag.
It arises in travelers who cross several time zones.
To determine which factor plays the decisive role in worsening mood, Pavlova recommended to track what changes the most on weekends.

Scientists in South Africa have claimed that the Pfizer vaccine against "omicron" is ineffective.
In South Africa, Pfizer's vaccine against "Omicron" has proven to be ineffective.
Scientists from the Republic of South Africa conducted a study and reported low efficacy of the Pfizer vaccine against the Omicron variant of the coronavirus infection.
According to estimates, the efficacy of the vaccine against the symptomatic infection is 22.5%, which casts doubt on its ability to protect against the infection, as stated in the study published on the MedRxiv portal.
At the same time, specialists clarified that the drug may save from a severe course of the disease.
Previously, the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine predicted that the omicron variant of the coronavirus could cause a new wave of pandemic with more frequent hospitalizations than last year.
How much sugar is hidden in common products?
Sugar is not the best source of nutrients.
His excess weight can lead to type 2 diabetes, as well as cause cardiovascular and oncological diseases.
Consumers should take into consideration that under the unknown word in the product may be listed a hidden sugar - an ingredient similar to sugar in calorie content, composition and glycemic index.
On the label, several dozen names can be found that essentially refer to sugar.
Glucose and fructose are some of the most common and frequently encountered names.
Other refined sugars, such as dextrose (sugar obtained from corn), fructose (fruit sugar), levulose (wood sugar), maple syrup, and others.
These are simple sugars which relate to mono- and disaccharides, and they can be found in confectionery products, ketchup, doctored sausage, bread and more.
According to Rosca, the most effective way to reduce sugar consumption is to eat whole and unprocessed products, as well as pay attention to labels and the many different names for sugar.
Different types of sugar differ in taste, but whatever the ingredient's composition - syrup or nectar, processed or unprocessed, brown or white, it remains sugar.
Calculating the exact amount of sugar is not easy, as it is necessary to take into account not only the amount of sugar stated on the packaging, but also that fruits, vegetables and other ingredients may contain a certain amount of sugar.
In this way, the total amount of sugar may turn out to be significantly higher than what is indicated on the label.
Chancellor of Germany Scholz: Natural gas will lose its importance for Germany within 25 years.
New Chancellor of Germany Olaf Scholz stated that the import of gas is losing its importance for Germany, as the country is continuing its transition to decarbonization of the economy.
According to him, Germany plans to completely abandon gas, oil and coal by 2045, becoming a climate-neutral country.
He said, "The question of transporting gas to Germany and Europe will have a different role to play in 25 years."
Scholz noted that Germany continues to maintain its commitment to Ukraine transporting Russian natural gas in the future, as it is an important resource for the country's energy transition.
He reminded that Germany and the United States made a statement in which support for Ukraine's energy transformation was affirmed.
Former German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock stated that the certification process for the "Nord Stream 2" gas pipeline is ongoing.
According to the minister, within the framework of coalition talks and the discussion of the coalition agreement, it was stated that energy projects should be subject to European energy law.
The diplomat also noted that the pipeline does not meet the requirements of the European Union.

However, the president added: "France would be less beautiful without New Caledonia".

The risk of cancer increases if you significantly deviate from this number in either direction.
Do not take vitamin B9 in tablets without a doctor's recommendation, monitor the dosage and avoid milk and other food products that contain folic acid.
A nutrition consultant Rachel Fein called folic acid a substance that slows aging.
Since it also contains avocado, Faine recommended men over 50 years old to eat this fruit more often.
In the UK, up to 75,000 people could die from the novel coronavirus by April.
According to British scientists, up to 75,000 people in England could die in the next five months if no additional preventive measures are taken during the winter.
The Guardian reported on a study by experts from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), cites TASS.
According to the most optimistic forecasts of the experts included in the British Cabinet's scientific advisory group on emergency situations, by April 2022, the country will record at least 25,000 fatal cases of the Omicron virus and a total of 175,000 people will be hospitalized.
At its peak, the hospital will be accepting more than 2,000 infected people per day.
Serious measures to combat the coronavirus may be necessary to prevent overburdening the National Health Service, if the Omikron variant proves to be more contagious than the Delta variant, and existing vaccines cannot prevent infections.
The U.K. Health Security Agency has warned that if the spread of the Omicron strain remains at its current level, there could be around one million cases of infection in the country by the end of the year.
By the middle of December, the Omikron strain could become the dominant one in the United Kingdom.
In the United Kingdom, 1898 cases of Coronavirus infection have been detected, including 633 cases in the last 24 hours.
At the same time, the head of the British Ministry of Health, Sajid Javid, pointed out that in reality this figure could reach 10,000 cases.
She wanted to write a smart comment, but she read until this point:
Suffering, endured by the unfortunate animal and its subsequent re-employment.
Under the table fell!
It turns out, "unfortunate creature" is a man, and I thought it was a shark!
The last knight on this planet.

The demand for superyachts has grown exponentially in the world.
Construction of superyachts this year and orders for next year have broken all records, despite calls to reduce hydrocarbon emissions and fight climate change.
In the ship register, the number of ordered yachts amounted to 1200 units, which is 25% more than last year.
It is difficult to imagine that the number of people who want and can afford a luxurious yacht for more than 50 million pounds will decrease, writes The Guardian.
However, it is becoming more and more.
This year, 25% more ships were ordered than in the previous year.
The brokers say that there has been no panic on the market for the last 20 years.
The first reason is that many who can afford it fear infection on land and prefer to hide from the pandemic on board their own vessel.
The second reason is also related to the coronavirus.
If before these people used to go to the office and meet with business partners in person, now the majority of them work remotely, and their conversations are conducted over Zoom.
Will Christie told the newspaper that the shipyard is taking orders for new yachts for 2025 and later.
This means that customers are willing to pay more, just so their yacht is ready by year or two earlier.
People simply thirst for freedom, he says.
In Western society, many criticize such behavior of the rich and call it decadent.
The rich, according to sociologists, do not want to understand that in times of hardship, travel to space, life on yachts, or flights on one's own planes arouse resentment, since the elite does not want to share the responsibility for changing the climate with the rest of humanity.
Economists are calling on governments to act and are proposing new taxes and regulations for the super-rich, even though they realize it will be difficult to implement.
Meanwhile, it is only the quantity of super-yachts that impresses, but their characteristics as well.
Out of 1200 ships, 27 have a length of the stern exceeding 100 meters.
A Norwegian billionaire is building a yacht called REV Ocean, which is 183 meters long.
After launching, it will be the world's largest yacht.
A yacht has been provided with a "moon pool" as well as a submarine designed for exploring the depths of the sea.
Existing super-yachts have become platforms for helicopters, cinemas under the open sky, and some of them, such as the yacht of the fighter McGregor, a platform for martial arts. Professor of economic anthropology at the University of Indiana Richard Wilk says that compared to the total number of carbon emissions from fossil fuels, the footprint of the super-rich is insignificant.
He has a symbolic meaning if you consider that there are more than 2000 people in the world who are multimillionaires.
This is just another example of excess consumption by a small minority.
Scientists discovered that the emission trail of millionaires is a thousand times greater than the trail of the average person on the planet.
If one person produces an average of 5 tons of CO2 per year, Roman Abramovich is responsible for 33.9 tons of greenhouse gases that entered the atmosphere in 2018.
At the same time, two-thirds of the emissions trail attached itself to his yacht Eclipse, which is 162.5 meters long.
Even if there is no owner on board the yacht, the crew continues to poison the planet.
The owner can call the captain and give the order to sail the yacht, for example, from the Mediterranean Sea to the Caribbean.
The owners of superyachts do not elicit sympathy from other people, like the wealthiest woman in Australia, Gina Rinehart, who owns coal mines on the continent, complains through YouTube that there is no place for their giant ships to dock.
It is difficult to understand her appeal to build marinas for ships of up to 50 meters.
A dangerous weekly dose of alcohol, leading to the development of cancer of the colon.
American scientists have determined that drinking alcohol in excess increases the risk of developing cancer.
Daily Express is writing about this.
Experts concluded that consuming four or more servings of alcoholic beverages per week is associated with an increased risk of developing cancer.
As the amount of alcohol consumed increases, the likelihood of developing the illness also increases.
Moreover, the risk of developing colorectal cancer is higher among moderate drinkers than among women.
Researchers cannot pinpoint the exact cause of this type of cancer, only noting that certain factors lead to a detrimental process for the body.

Dogs can understand words and phrases at the level of a two-year-old child.
Many, or rather all dog lovers are sure that these creatures are very intelligent.
Even they do not realize how developed the four-legged pets are.
For many years, biologists have conducted various experiments in order to definitely determine the intelligence of animals.
Although a dog's vocabulary is not as extensive as a human's, a new study shows that dogs can respond to 89 words or phrases.
The works of scientists were published in the journal Sciencealert.
Dogs cannot play chess or compose poetry, but they often manage to fool their owners.
Experts believe that certain breeds of dogs show the best results in understanding human language, but there is not enough statistical data for precise conclusions.
Some breeds are traditionally considered canine geniuses, such as Labradors.
Scientists concluded that dogs are capable of logical thinking, and their ability to learn is not inferior to that of a two-year-old child.

In Ukraine, preparations are being made for trade between the United States and Russia.
The United States and Russia will be "negotiating" over Ukraine's entry into NATO, according to analyst Alexander Kotsykov in his article for "Glavred".
According to him, Washington and Moscow are planning to continue negotiations in the near future about guarantees from the United States that Ukraine will not join the North Atlantic Alliance, despite the words of American leader Joe Biden about the right of countries to "enter wherever they want".
If someone were to offer you something clearly unacceptable, for example, to sell a close relative into sexual slavery, you would not engage in trade, but simply report the offerer.
Regarding Ukraine, an analyst wrote that a trade is anticipated.
Kochetkov added that Russia is not planning to attack Ukraine, but is instead striving for a dialogue with Kyiv.
He noted that preparations are conducted secretly, quickly moving on to offensive actions without waiting to be discovered and outnumbered.
China is stimulating the development of the railway industry.
Advanced Chinese technologies attracted the attention of companies from the United States, Germany, France, and other countries at the Chinese International Exhibition of Railway Transport and Equipment 2021, which was held in the city of Chuzhou, in the province of Hunan /Central China/.
CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co. Ltd.'s core technologies enable trains to automatically detect and diagnose technical problems, as noted by company representative Hou Chjowen.
High-speed trains, running on the China-Laos railway line, which was put into operation in the beginning of this month, are already equipped with these technologies, which will ensure increased safety and operationality of the rolling stock.
In the last six months, China has significantly increased its exports of railway transportation equipment, and many countries in Asia and Europe are now witnessing the "Chinese speed".
In May of this year, CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co., Ltd. rolled out the first two-story high-speed electric trains designed for export to Europe.
These trains will be travelling at a maximum speed of 200 kilometers per hour on the railways of Austria, Germany, Hungary and other European countries.
The experimental operation of the metro train, developed by the above-mentioned company for Turkey, began in November.
The train will be moving along the metro line connecting the center of Istanbul to the airport city.
The metro line will be open next year.
This will be the fastest metro line in Turkey with a speed of 120 kilometers per hour.
China's manufacturing of railway equipment is one of the industries with the highest level of innovation and the strongest international competitiveness, said Fan Yousi, head of the Trade and Investment Promotion Department of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade /CCPIT/.
This industry enjoys the main competitive advantage of Chinese production of high-end equipment on the global market, - said Fan Yao.
After more than 60 years of intense work, including numerous independent studies and developments, China has created a leading system of equipment production for railway transport, with a full range of auxiliary tools and large-scale production activities.
According to Fen Yao, the country ranks first in terms of electrification of railways and in terms of operational performance on high-speed and urban railways.
The biologist listed the early signs of dementia.
Candidate of Biological Sciences Semen Goloshchikin in a conversation with Radio Sputnik listed early signs of dementia.
According to him, signs of dementia may include forgetfulness, as well as moderate cognitive impairments such as difficulty concentrating, planning, and lowered abstract thinking.
Currently, there is a discussion about whether hearing loss can be an early manifestation of Alzheimer's disease, as well as a risk factor for its occurrence, said a specialist.
Goloshinkin emphasized that dementia can be caused by neurodegenerative disorders, head trauma, certain infections, metabolic abnormalities, and vitamin deficiencies.
He added that Alzheimer's disease and atherosclerosis of the blood vessels of the brain are the most common causes of this syndrome.
The biologist noted that today there are no effective treatments for dementia.
Therefore, it is necessary to start its prevention in time.
He said that reducing the risk of dementia can be helped by learning foreign languages and engaging in active communication.
The World Health Organization recommends maintaining a moderate physical load, engaging in cognitive activities such as games and hobbies that require intensive involvement of memory and logical thinking.
There are recommendations for the use of various drugs, but their effectiveness and appropriateness are still debated in the scientific community, said Golochevsky.
The World Health Organization recommends maintaining a moderate level of physical exertion, regular training of cognitive skills and abilities through games and hobbies that require intense involvement of memory and logical thinking, - said Goloshinkin.
The British charity Alzheimer's Research UK announced that the disease is increasingly affecting people in their 40s.
Doctors called the early symptoms of Alzheimer's disease.
The first warning sign can be considered vision problems, due to which the patient may have difficulty recognizing objects.
Another sign of developing dementia was called aphasia - a state in which a person is unable to find the right words to express what they want to say.
Neurologist ordered Saakashvili to be sent abroad for treatment.
Former President of Georgia Mikheil Saakashvili needs psychological treatment and rehabilitation abroad, stated neurologist Otar Toidze, who is part of the consilium of doctors created by the Ombudsman of Georgia.
His neurological status is the leading factor in his illness.
The stable problems are problems with movement, coordination, and inconsistency of character, - said the specialist, noting that this does not exceed the normative parameters and now ex-president needs to be sent for special rehabilitation.
We call this neurosurgery and psychoneurotic rehabilitation, which is not available in Georgia, according to Toidze, who requested that Saakashvili be treated in a special institution.
On December 7, Saakashvili began to obstruct obtaining medical assistance after the penitentiary service subjected him to disciplinary punishment.
The Georgian politician was able to repeal the punishment and restore their former rights.

The steep slope: how the Chinese become skiers.
The Olympics should attract millions of people and help create international-level resorts in the country.
In China, they hope that the Olympics will not only attract 300 million citizens to take up winter sports, which will allow President Xi Jinping to collect the 1 trillion yuan he has pledged, but also contribute to the economic development of backward and remote provinces.
The ski resort of Taishan in Changchun, located near the site of the Winter Olympics, is becoming increasingly popular among Chinese people.
Besides constructing infrastructure in the region, workers are also planting trees: they are sowing trees.
There are over 700 ski resorts in the country, but only 20 of them are large enough to host international competitions.
In many regions of China, including Chengdu, there are problems with snow.
The main task for the long-term perspective is to ensure comfortable and interesting vacations on Chinese resorts so that newcomers become regulars.
However, even further.
Justin Downs, a former Olympic skiing coach, says that the Chinese ski industry has changed beyond recognition since his last visit in 2007.
Every year more and more Chinese people go to the mountains in winter.
Fiona, a snowboarder from Beijing, is one of them.
Despite significant changes, many years will be needed to create a ski culture here, according to Downs.
Many resorts are located in agricultural and mining areas.
These regions still need to be actively developed and created there the necessary infrastructure for rest.
70-year-old Gao Meng lives in Chunli, near the site of the Winter Olympic Games.
He notes that there has been a boom in winter sports tourism in recent years.
Two years ago, they travelled from Beijing to Chunli by a high-speed railway, and now none of the local people suffer from unemployment.
More and more stores are opening up in the country that are selling clothing and sports equipment for winter sports.
Points of national cuisine are opened on the slopes.
Now there is even a testing station for COVID-19.
China is striving to create a prosperous industry of winter sports, its athletes must become leaders of the largest international competitions, and resorts and equipment should reach a world-class level.
More than 500 million people around the world could face extreme poverty due to the pandemic, according to the World Health Organization.
More than 500 million people around the world could be pushed into extreme poverty due to the coronavirus pandemic, which has slowed progress towards universal healthcare access, according to the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank.
In connection with the 12 December International Day of Universal Health Coverage, WHO and the World Bank have published two complementary reports.
They concluded that the pandemic caused disruptions to healthcare services, and excess stress on the healthcare system.
In this regard, for the first time in 10 years, the coverage of immunization has decreased, and mortality from tuberculosis and malaria has grown.
The WHO and the World Bank highlighted that the pandemic has caused the "worst economic crisis since the 1930s, making it harder for people to pay for treatment.
This situation pushes over 500 million people into extreme poverty, as they are forced to pay for these services out of their own pocket.
In October, United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres said that the pandemic has plunged more than 100 million people into poverty, over four billion people almost completely lacking social support.

The Taiwanese minister was disconnected from the transmission of the "Democracy Summit" at the request of the White House.
The minister's speech at the panel discussion during the US-organized "Democracy Summit" was translated into audio-only, as evidenced by the YouTube recording of the summit.
Reuters Agency reports, citing sources, that the picture was disabled by the White House.
According to their report, the reason was that the map showed Taiwan as a separate color from China, which considers the island as its territory.
The map shown by Mrs. Tan was compiled by the South African non-governmental organization CIVICUS and ranked countries according to their level of citizen rights' provision.
Taiwan was designated green as "free", while China, North Korea, Laos and Vietnam were designated red, indicating "closed".
After the minister showed the map, the picture on her side was replaced by a screenshot with the remark that "the opinions of the participants in the discussion do not necessarily reflect the position of the government of the United States".
China was not invited to the "Democracy Summit".
Reuters noted that the map shown by the Taiwanese minister could go against Washington's "one China" policy.
One source from the agency said that after the demonstration of the map by the U.S. National Security Council, it angrily contacted the State Department, accusing it of showing Taiwan as a separate country.
The Washington-organized "Democracy Summit" was held from December 9th to 10th with the participation of representatives from 110 countries and territories, as well as civil society groups and non-profit organizations.
Russia was not invited to the summit.
On the first day of the summit, Nobel Peace Prize laureate and "New Newspaper" editor-in-chief Dmitry Muratov called for the creation of an international fund, through which money obtained through corruption could be donated to charity.
Yesterday, Deputy Secretary of the Russian Security Council Yury Averyanov stated that the summit was "anti-Russian and anti-Chinese charge".

China is strengthening prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic in cities where land ports of entry are located.
The State Council of the People's Republic of China issued a circular ordering local governments to strengthen prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic at land border checkpoints in order to prevent the import of the virus from other countries.
According to the circular, people leaving these cities must provide a negative COVID-19 test result obtained within 48 hours of departure.
Those who arrive in cities where there are land border checkpoints must upon arrival submit at least one test for COVID-19 nucleic acids.
The document states that these requirements will be in effect until provincial administrative units determine and publish the zones of the specified cities until March 15, 2022.
In addition, it is noted that cities where land border checkpoints are located and which meet certain conditions may consider the creation of buffer zones for the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic within their jurisdiction.

Organizing points of nasal vaccination with intranasal vaccine is easier, but I would initially do it only in medical institutions.
The likelihood of an allergic reaction to the vaccine is low, but it is better to stay near the doctor's office just in case.
There are special sets of anti-allergy medications that can work within minutes, which is sometimes very necessary, as stated by Nechaev.
According to a virologist, it will be possible to consider vaccinating in shopping centers when there is enough experience with the use of the drug.
He also emphasized that it was important for the nasal vaccine to come into contact with the mucous membrane in the nasal cavity.
There is a chance that the vaccine will not reach its destination if it is snorted after injection.

Four scenarios for Zelensky were named in Ukraine.
Former Ukrainian parliamentarian Vadim Denisenko outlined four scenarios for President Vladimir Zelensky's development in 2022.
According to him, the head of state can remain without support from the West, as well as possibly go to compromise on the Donbas.
On Sunday, December 12, Denisenko told the story in the publication "Glavred".
The first option, which Denisenko called "the ideal storm", implies that Ukraine will no longer be supported by key western countries after reaching an agreement about the future of the country without its participation.
Such developments will contribute to a deep crisis, which Kyiv may face in 2023.
Prices for key goods which we traditionally export <...> internal protests and opposition from key FPG (financial-industrial groups. - Red.) were added by a former parliamentarian.
According to Denisenko, there is another scenario for the development of the situation - "war against all".
If there is high turbulence in world politics, Ukrainian authorities will face a number of challenges.
Due to the current situation, the leadership of Ukraine may go to compromises over the Donbas, which could lead to internal opposition.
At the end of the summer, Zelinsky's positions will weaken, according to the former MP, with a probability of 50-55%.
The third option for the development of the situation in Ukrainian politics is a clash between opposing groups of people and the president, which could lead to a takeover of the power by populist initiatives.
During this crisis, Zelensky will begin "reforming" power, added Denisenko.
Another script - transforming Zelensky into "the father of the nation".
This can lead to some event that will be a powerful shock to society.
The event should be significant enough to elicit a reaction from external partners and lead to increased support for Ukraine, - said Denisenko.
This variant of the situation is possible due to a natural disaster, technological catastrophe or aggressive actions by Russia, according to the ex-deputy.
The Russian side has already rejected any possibility of an attack on Ukraine.
In Moscow, it was noted that Ukrainian authorities, NATO, and the United States are increasing military activity near Russian borders.
Previously, on November 11, the sociological group "Rating" showed that the rating of the Ukrainian president had dropped to record low levels, standing at 19.3%.
This is the lowest approval rating of his presidency.

Among those surveyed, only 19.3% expressed support for the president.

Estonian scientists will be searching for life on Venus.
The Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in collaboration with the Tartu Observatory and other research institutions and companies, is preparing three space missions to Venus to search for signs of life in the atmosphere, reported on Sunday "Actual Camera".
The goal of the five-year mission is to assess the suitability of clouds on Venus, and then search for life there.
Venusian cloud researchers from Tartu University have proposed instruments for measuring acidity and oxygen content in the clouds.
It was previously assumed that the clouds of Venus, the closest planet to Earth, were too acidic to support life, but it is now believed that Venus may have originally been a planet similar to Earth.
During the third mission, a sample from Venus is supposed to arrive.
If we find life there, the main question will be whether it is similar to Earth or different.
If it is very similar, it will be obvious that Earthly life did not begin on Earth.
If it differs, it may become more likely that life originated on Earth, according to the leader of the Estonian "Venus Life Finder" project, Mihkel Paju.

The most important factor is the pandemic, followed by inflation, according to him.
He also admitted that he didn't know if the increase in prices was temporary or not.
According to the specialist, it was clear before the pandemic that "the world of infinite generosity of central banks had been exhausted" and it was time to return to relationships where interest rates would be correlated with expected growth in GDP.
O'Neill noted that, in the wake of the pandemic, continuing with a lax economic policy may, according to some experts, lead to a new wave of inflation.
In addition, it is important to pay attention to the question of productivity, as well as poverty and climate change, summarized O'Neill.
Michael Schulgin, Head of Global Research at Discovery Investment, said that their positive expectations for the dollar in 2022 remain, but the potential for growth will be less significant.

Russia gave auto dealerships approximately 4.5% of the country's GDP.
According to the results of 10 months of 2021, Russians spent 2 trillion 784 billion rubles on the purchase of new cars, which is 28% more than the same period last year, according to statistics from the Russian Automotive Market Research (NAPI).
Approximately the same sum (around 3 trillion rubles) was spent by the government to support citizens and the economy during the COVID-19 pandemic.
In September, at the meeting of the heads of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, President Vladimir Putin said that this amount is comparable to more than 4.5% of the country's GDP (Gross Domestic Product) for 2020.

Regularly update prices for their products and other automakers.
The volume of the Russian automotive market in monetary terms will continue to grow beyond the deficit of cars due to inflation, as well as the efforts of automakers to recoup past losses, according to experts.
In the context of a shortage of cars, I believe that many automakers were able to shift some of the costs they could not previously afford to the consumer, such as those from previous periods.
An analyst from VTB Capital, Vladimir Bessapalov, is speaking about the automotive industry.
I believe that car manufacturers are feeling very good financially, maintaining high margins on sales.
Indicators of this include the growth rate of car prices observed in 2021, which is faster than inflation, according to an expert.
In the long term, the market will grow both quantitatively and monetarily, but mainly due to inflation and the complexity of the machines, as predicted by Bessapov.
The possibilities for increasing prices will be limited.
In monetary terms, the Russian automotive market is expected to continue to grow in the coming year, even if the growth rate of car prices slows, according to independent automotive consultant Sergey Burgazliev.
Considering the increased demand and decreased supply, automakers are now striving to get the highest profit from each car they sell, as noted by Burgazliev.
Increased production volumes are not expected at least within the next few months, while in Russia the agitation is further fueled by citizens' uncertainty about the future.
In the current market situation, cars have proved to be a good investment - a car bought a year ago, even with a depreciation, can now be sold for more than the original cost, according to an expert.

The United States has never considered sending American military forces to Ukraine in the event of a "invasion" by Russia.
President Joe Biden made this statement.
Never were such plans, - said the head of the White House, responding to a journalist's question about whether the United States had abandoned such an idea.

He emphasized that the US and NATO have no obligation to use military force to protect Ukraine if the situation escalates.
The American leader also stated that the use of American troops in a unilateral manner to defend Ukraine is not on the agenda.
Biden explained that if Russia invades Ukraine, the United States will deploy forces to Eastern European countries in the NATO alliance (Bulgaria, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Czech Republic, and Estonia).
We will have to deploy more American and NATO troops to the eastern flank, B9 - all the countries of NATO, regarding which we have a sacred obligation to protect them from any attack from Russia, said Biden.
The press secretary of the President of Russia, Dmitry Peskov, emphasized that Moscow has no intention of invading Ukraine.
He pointed out that Moscow sees the problem in the use of drones by Turkey, as well as the approach of American weapons to our territory.
