The Czech loser's big comeback is coming.
Pavel the Frenchman was called up to the NHL
Czech hockey goalie Pavel Francouz, who has been going through a difficult period in his career in recent months, is returning to the NHL.
The 31-year-old Pilsen native will be on the substitutes' bench and could soon find his way into the goal.
The former goalkeeper of Litvínov, Plzeň or Russian Chelyabinsk was injured in preparation for the NHL in October of this year.
He took over midway through the Vegas game and hasn't appeared on an NHL rink since.
The incident occurred as the experienced goalkeeper moved from one pole to another.
"Pavel French will be out for approximately three to four weeks with a lower-body injury", announced the Denver team in early October.
His return to NHL goaltending eventually extended to over two months.
On Sunday morning, U.S. time, he was called from the farm, where he caught four duels and showed his old form.
In AHL, he took credit for 94.5% of the surgeries.
A hockey prodigy from Plzeň wants to make a name for himself and prove that he belongs in the best league in the world.
He had hip problems his senior year, and he didn't catch a single game in the shortened pandemic season.
In the NHL, Francis has caught 36 games, and his surgical success rate is 92.3%.
Charles puts Camille's veil on his Christmas card, William and Kate pose in Jordan
Britain's Prince William and his wife Kate have chosen as this year's Christmas wish a family photograph taken during a trip to Jordan.
Prince Charles also made his wishes public, using a photograph of his wife Camille helping him put on the mask at the races.
This was reported on its website by the British broadcaster BBC News.
They send wishes to friends, colleagues, and the foundations they work with.
The photograph was taken somewhere in a desert landscape.
The Duchess of Cambridge is dressed in a long khaki summer dress, and so is Princess Charlotte.
Prince William, the Duke of Cambridge, is wearing the same pair of shorts and collared T-shirts as Princes George and Louis.
Who took the photograph, William and Kate didn't say, it's not even clear exactly when it was taken.
Last year, the royal family posed for a Christmas card photo on a bundle of straw in front of a pile of wood at their country estate in Norfolk.
The image, which will serve as a Christmas wish, was also released by the heir to the throne, Prince Charles, and his wife, Camilla.
Photographer Sam Hussein captured them racing in Ascot in June.
Charles, wearing a cylinder on his head and a veil on his face, helps Camille put on her veil color-matched to a light dress.
According to efotbal.cz, Slavia promised Berbro a million for the title, Tvrdík denied it.
Prague  Criminal investigators in the current corruption case allegedly worked with the fact that the accused former vice-president of the Football Association of the Czech Republic, Roman Berbr, was supposed to have been promised a million crowns by Prague's Slavia for the league title in the 2018/19 season.
He informed efotbal.cz about it, saying that he had access to part of the police files.
The chairman of the board of the senior club Jaroslav Tvrdík stated that the red and white did not commit any corrupt acts.
The server has published transcripts of the police wiretaps, in which Slavonia is mainly represented by its former sports director Jan Nezmar, who resigned from the championship club last summer.
According to the file, the former influential functionary of the Red and White was in frequent contact with both Berber and the former sports director of the second league Vyšehrad Roman Rogoz, who is also among the accused in the case.
Forensics reportedly worked with information that Slavia had promised Berbro a monetary reward for obtaining the title.
In 2019, the team SK Slavia Praha won the title in the first league.
The police authority had knowledge that for winning the league, Roman (Berber) was to receive a million-dollar bribe promised by SK Slavia Prague officials, the server quoted from the file.
A day later, according to the criminologists, Berbr met not only with Nezmar, but also with the chairman of the board Slavie Tvrdík.
According to the server, it's unclear from the file whether the police are still investigating this information.
The claimant denied any corrupt conduct.
Between 2015 and 2017, we actively sought to change the situation in Czech football and offered an opposing alternative to its development.
We have never engaged in illegal conduct, we have not sought to influence the referees contrary to the rules of fair play, and we have not provided anyone with any financial benefits in this regard", Tvrdík told Seznam Zprávy.
In the wiretaps, among other things, Nezmar indiscriminately insults some of Slavia's former black players and also slanders his former boss Tvrdík.
The case of alleged match-fixing by referees was triggered in mid-October last year by police raids in several locations, including the Prague headquarters of the FAČR.
The highest-ranking official in the affair is Berber, who is no longer involved in any of the football functions.
In mid-January, Rogoz was released from detention, as was the former sports director of Vyšehrad.
Helicopters, tanks and guns are the larping of the Cold War.
The guns will be new, but in principle of a lesser type (artillerymen must leave the armored cabin and carry the cartridges by hand without cover).
Cars - Toyota hi-lux - are new and good
Trucks and various armored vehicles - at a decent level, moreover, it has already managed to get rid of Prague V3S even in specialized units.
Aircraft: combat- decent, but at the end of the lease, transport - too small with a short range, but modern.
Drones - few and small types with no combat potential
Rockets - we don't have any (but we manufacture and export)
PVO: medium - Cold War, obsolete; short-range - good, modern, relatively good number.
I have a story.
I've got a chase right outside of town.
There were nutria crawling out of the river, doing damage to the crops, so I sat there.
As I was coming, I saw that there was a fisherman on the other side of the river.
I didn't want to make a scene, so I just sat quietly, and I don't think the guy even noticed me.
I was hoping he'd leave before something came out, but of course, the fox came in a little while later.
I let her come within 40 yards before I decided to shoot.
Poor fisherman almost shit himself, waving his head in all directions, so I called him that it was a fox.
By the time I got off the property, he was gone.
I mean, even a meadow can be a Prusser.
On the other hand, it's not a war, it would have to be a combination of a lot of coincidences for something to happen, you'd probably be seen in the thermal mirror that almost everyone has these days.
So, in plain sight, put your valuables in your sleeping bag, and you should be fine.
The Warriors against the Hammocks.
Inside got the respirators much cheaper than the Ministry of Health.
The state responsible for the purchase and distribution of face coverings, masks and respirators for the professions closest to the coronavirus has spent billions of crowns on their acquisition in recent weeks.
The iRadio server compared the purchases of individual ministries and found that during a single day, the amount of the respirator varied by hundreds of crowns.
Why did prices move so dramatically?
Which authorities have been economical?
And why did others buy the rail?
Lenka Kabrhel is speaking with the editor of the iRadio server, Dominika Kubištová.
I respect the soldiers and the army (perhaps I am not affected by the memories of the ČSLA that older generations have gone through), but the Czech Republic cannot benefit from compulsory military service.
We don't even have a large inventory of equipment that trained people can grab onto, we don't really have modern technology even for existing professionals, plus modern technology is getting more and more complex, so the skills of the substitutes will be rapidly lost over time.
On top of that, modern conventional conflicts, where anyone can deploy them, will happen very quickly, there won't be time to retrain anyone.
And finally, reservists/territorial defense are of great importance to countries like Ukraine, where mass guerrilla warfare is a prerequisite to deter the enemy.
On the territory of the Czech Republic, the fight will only take place in a conflict of such scope and intensity, where the guerrilla will be irrelevant, and we do not even have the appropriate geography.
First of all, we don't have an individual skill.
That's not even the worst part.
The worst part is, half of them act like they have it.
That's when you're in a situation where you're watching a guy who missed an empty goal two minutes ago go into attack alone between two or even three Swiss and you're like, "Wow, what do you think's going to happen now?"
Well, of course they'll take him as an average taxpayer.
The situation with this kicking-the-defender thing is so terrible that I find myself frankly surprised to see that our forward has been able to outplay one of the other players.
The first swallows
The Covid pandemic is slowing down, but experts don't expect any major upheaval in the coming weeks.
The surge in hospitals, according to statistical models, will continue for some time, and the pandemic equation has, as we know, added a new unknown: the Omicron variant, which is very likely to spread faster than the currently prevalent Delta.
At the same time, it is not yet possible to say with absolute certainty whether it can cause a more severe course, insofar as vaccination or post-infectious immunity acquired from a previous course of the disease helps against it.
But this week, an unexpected phenomenon has entered the Covid equation on the plus side: the possibility of a cure.
A new drug has arrived in the Czech Republic, the antiviral drug molnupiravir, which reduces the risk of severe disease and associated hospitalization by a third and can be treated at home.
And soon it should be joined by Pfizer's paxlovid, which reports an 85-percent success rate so far.
The first deliveries of molnupiravir to the Czech Republic, however, in addition to hopes of expanding the portfolio of tools useful in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic, also highlighted the question of how prepared the Czech administration is for incoming drugs.
As mentioned, Merck's molnupiravir is the first to be delivered to domestic patients.
The company ended up on the tapes first also because the drug had been developed long before the current pandemic broke out with the aim of finding a suitable treatment for a viral disease of horses on the South American continent.
What's often overlooked in this research is that people in the West (Germany, Sweden, etc.)
are generally less open and do not openly share their opinions.
On the other hand, Eastern Europeans, and especially we Czechs, are used to talking about "how our beaks grew".
You do research where you ask people if they like Muslims.
In the Czech Republic, most people would say no.
In the West, they tell you how much they love migration, how everyone should help them, and how we Czechs are racist assholes.
And then they go and vote for parties like the AfD.
They're afraid of cancel culture, saying this in public means job loss and media lynching.
Then it looks good in the polls, west good, east bad.
But they'll really find out what people are thinking.
Only in France do Le Pen and Zemmour both have more than 20%, according to the poll.
We even know that the objects are three in Czech and completely identical.
Identical because of the rotation of the units, so the soldiers don't have to re-learn where everything is, so all the objects are exactly the same.
One is the Brda Atom Museum and the other two are abandoned.
The funny thing is, the USSR didn't want to have nuclear warheads on its own territory, either for safety reasons or because of the speed of deployment of the warheads due to its more westerly location.
In those underground shelters (there are two in each maple) only the warheads were stored, not the entire rocket, as they say.
If there was a need to deploy this weapon, a special unit would come and pick up this warhead and mount it on some kind of carrier device.
Apart from the museum maple, the rest are in a desolate state.
In the second grade of elementary school, we had a gypsy classmate, we were together for four years.
He was pretty cool, he made good jokes, he often got a little too outspoken, but he was kind of our mascot.
Everybody talked to him, he came around a lot and wanted to explain things, he didn't miss much, he came regularly, he played sports with us, he didn't steal snacks, he didn't steal phones, he kept his clothes clean.
He went to school in the wilderness, did a lot of monkey business, but he was all right, never in trouble.
In the eighth or ninth grade, siblings, gypsies, entered the same class, different classes.
In short, they beat the teacher, the police were involved, they threatened and threatened the other students.
Personally, I sometimes sell something to advertise (old things, something I don't need, etc.) and I've sold often to the Gypsies, they always had money, they didn't try any attempts to pull me on the price, communication was calm.
I even sold the car like this, the guy called a month later and said he'd already written it off.
I tell myself that I am not a racist, I don't care if someone is white, black, yellow, blue or any other, as long as they behave as they should in a decent society (work, function, don't beat women, just normal behavior).
But if someone comes, stretches out his hand, empties apartments and houses, has a mess around him, makes trouble... then it doesn't matter what color he is, but it will bother me.
I have no problem with African migrants, as long as they get involved with us, start businesses, work, learn the language (not necessarily English, at least), respect our culture.
I don't care if they believe in Allah, as long as they respect my traditions and culture, I'll respect theirs.
A young woman died in a car accident on Prachaticka.
'A young woman suffered serious multiple injuries and, despite resuscitation, unfortunately succumbed to her injuries on the spot,' Zuzana Fajtlová, spokeswoman for the South Bohemian paramedics, told Pravda.
The accident was probably caused by the driver who was carrying the girl.
The 18-year-old driver of a Peugeot car was probably driving in the direction from Žíchovec to Bavorov and, for reasons not yet known, turned in the opposite direction.
After a collision with a Skoda Octavia, the Peugeot ended up on the roof off the road, described the accident spokesman of the South Bohemian Police Štěpánka Schwarzová.
The young driver of the Peugeot suffered very serious injuries in the accident.
There were multiple injuries and he was trapped in the car.
After being discharged, he had to be given acute pre-hospital care and was airlifted to a hospital in Czechoslovakia in a stable condition, said the rescue worker Fajtlová.
She added that the man in the other car suffered minor chest injuries and was taken to a hospital.
New rules apply to parcels from non-EU countries, which are often not reported by customers
Lukáš Neuheisl orders from abroad several times a month.
He mainly buys collector's cards.
"Usually it can be tens of dollars, let's say from ten dollars upwards, where it's still worth importing, especially from Japan, where the mail is often free", the collector said.
Since October, ordering small shipments has become slightly more expensive for him, and now he has to add VAT and submit data for customs clearance.
He receives an e-mail saying that Customs is expecting the package to arrive.
Then it is enough to fill in the details of the consignment, and if the VAT has not been included by the trader at the time of the sale, it is charged by the customs office from the total amount for the consignment and for the transport.
Where the consignee does not carry out the customs procedure himself, the carrier's remuneration must also be added to the total amount.
But according to Lukas Neuheisel, the whole process isn't complicated.
I click one or two check boxes, insert two attachments, and I'm done.
For me, it's usually a matter of five minutes, says Neuheisl.
But not all shipments are delivered smoothly.
Due to new customs regulations, the daily number of incoming foreign mail dropped from 60,000 to 15,000 at the international post office in Prague.
In addition, according to Česká pošta, the problem is also that people do not respond to requests for data needed to complete the customs procedure.
Right now, there are 30,000 parcels in the international mail that we have to process.
If people filled in all the information that is needed, and filled it in on time, we would be about halfway there, says Czech Post spokesman Matyáš Vitík.
Dealing with Inflation
See the headline, how would you propose a solution to current inflation?
We're currently at 9.9% inflation, and it's expected to continue to rise.
What do you think the state should do to slow or offset this growth?
We see, for example, in Poland the reduction of VAT on foodstuffs and PHM, is this the way for you?
What do you think is gonna happen that's inevitable with where this is going?
Prices are rising faster than wages, and I think it's inevitable that people won't be able to afford everyday things, especially energy.
How much did you get added (who's the employee)?
I'm up 2% gross this year, which is ridiculous, but fortunately, I have a similar income from a business that I run as an employee.
Would someone be able to explain to me why convicted rapists are sent to jail for as little as six months?
I just can't get my head around how a court can send an animal like that to jail for six months just to do it again as soon as he gets out.
6 months is nothing compared to the fact that his/her victim will have trauma for several years, negatively affecting his/her sexual relationships and relationships in general.
Not to mention the fact that a rape victim may never recover from it either.
Doesn't this also discourage potential future reporting of rape victims?
The man from the grave burned his girlfriend from the skeleton.
The Tomb Man inadvertently helped officers apprehend his nationally-wanted girlfriend from Kostomlat, who had a warrant out for her arrest.
After all, he himself called them to it.
But he took a detour.
First, he approached a passerby and concocted a story that he had been robbed.
When officers responded to a 911 call, they were surprised to learn that the alleged thief had told them that he had fabricated the theft to get the officers to come to the scene.
In fact, he only wanted advice from the guards on how to file a complaint with the Police of the Czech Republic.
While checking the identities of the man and his girlfriend, the officers discovered that the woman was on a wanted list, a nationwide manhunt, and a warrant had been issued for her arrest.
That's why the case is being handled by the DEA.
An honest question for the people here, do you consider our country to be Slavic?
I'm of the opinion that the Slavs are no longer ethnically or culturally, but I'd like to know your opinion.
Otherwise, of course, I agree with the meme, it's a pity that Churchill failed to secure the liberation of Prague USA:')
Of course, I'm not denying that we have a Slavic language.
Well, I don't know, it's quite a question whether a rational person can actually believe something completely without evidence just because it could potentially benefit them.
Personally, I wouldn't consider that a case of true faith.
I can't agree with Pascal on this, but there's an estimate, if I'm not mistaken, of about 10,000 different religions in the world.
Which god or gods should one choose?
I'd say it's quite likely that in any of the thousands of religions, there's at least one god who punishes you severely if you believe in another god.
Yet in the tenth it says that there is no God but Jehovah.
So in that case, wouldn't it be more rational to refrain from believing in any god than to risk choosing the wrong god out of a thousand gods, and the one true god that I just missed sending me to hell or some such place?
Other: Voluntary training followed by assignment to reserves.
I'm guessing the Swiss model is similar.
X months of training (in different specialisations, X months in one) and under the supervision of professionals with practical experience.
If you do well, you can get a pro offer.
All the ACR files could use something like this.
It could be done in conjunction with the Defense University.
Let's put it this way: There's a constant mismatch between the education sector and industry, companies are hunting in schools, and there's a kind of merger, where the workforce is migrating from the educational institutions to the employment relationships.
Not just as we grow up, but this process happens all the time, each of us is constantly learning something new, moving from one field to another, and so on.
A similar merger should work between the civilian and military sectors.
I also see it as a way to build some kind of relationship between the citizen and the military, an institution that guarantees that there will never again be a Russian, a German or a Mongolian invader.
I think it's funny how you think of NATO as something that's carved in stone, that we have allies and they're going to defend us if we get in trouble.
Well, please the master.
All it takes is one election in the U.S. to shrink their budget and the whole of NATO goes to shit.
The British will trade us for Russian money, the Germans will trade us for Russian gas, and the Poles have shown once before that all they have to do is turn their backs and take what they want.
The only thing that works in the long run as a guarantor of independence is an army armed to the teeth and a population that knows how to control the military technology of its time.
And nowadays, any teenager can pilot a remote-controlled device, so what the hell.
We don't need border fencing, which sucks these days, but a cuddly teenager at the knob of a remote-controlled device can handle it.
How to Avoid Drowning in a Box Tsunami
You unwrap your presents under the Christmas tree, and suddenly you're home with boxes and stuffing?
This 'waste' is reused by e-shops which lack packaging materials.
That's why we've created a map of shops that welcome your used boxes.
And not just at Christmas.
All packaging materials are designed to withstand repeated handling.
That's why it's a shame to treat them like disposable waste.
Anyone can bring cardboard boxes, plastic or paper fillings to the participating store (the KAMsNIM.cz project map contains almost 150 of them).
This will support small businesses, reduce the amount of waste generated, and also avoid overcrowded blue bins.
The shops themselves welcome the packaging, which is currently in short supply on the market, as well as the money saved, as cartonboard has risen in price by 50% in recent times.
In addition, it strengthens my brand in the eyes of environmentally conscious customers.
One such store is TIERRA VERDE, a manufacturer of eco-drugs and eco-cosmetics.
Boxes and filling materials are brought to us in Popůvek near Brno by individuals who collect them at home, but we also hear from companies with whom we have arranged regular deliveries of discarded cartons.
We'll use all of it to pack the shipments from our e-shop.
Thanks to individuals and businesses, we're working together to create a more caring world.
Our wish is to preserve the resources and beauty of nature for future generations, says Petra Lopušníková from Tierra.
However, the application www.KAMsNIM.cz does not only show the collection points for packaging material.
It serves as a locator if you need to dispose of anything (where to take sorted household waste, where to return expired medicines, tyres, spent electricity, batteries, light sources, bulk waste, etc.).
So all the trash can end up in the right place, plus the recyclable stuff finds its second home.
In total, the project map already contains over 100 000 such sites.
Gradually, collection yards, re-use centers, textile containers, food banks, charity shops, SWAPs and other places that help to find uses for things that would otherwise become unnecessary waste are increasing in number, adds Miroslav Kubásek, one of the authors of the application from the association Clean Up the Czech Republic.
I'm more concerned that technology today is so simple and foolproof that children who use a computer or a phone play games on it, but they don't learn basic computer skills in the process.
Recently there has been a problem (mainly in English articles) that college students don't understand the principle of files on a computer.
Because Google Photos or Apple's photo app or actually cell phones in general just hide the underlying file system with the files and dump everything on one screen in the app.
It's okay to use techniques from childhood, but it's important that they learn something.
Let's rewrite history, really
Emmanuel Macron presented the priorities of the French Presidency of the EU  starting in January  last weekend, and it was spectacular.
Macron spoke for over an hour, during which he unveiled the logo of the presidency, called for the protection of Europeans  at work, on the street  and mentioned so many actions that they cannot be done in six months.
But that's the way French politicians like it, and that's the way French voters like it.
Macron's left-right supporters agree on little, but they agree on Europe.
And in France, there will be new elections for the head of state in April.
The election calendar affected the priorities themselves.
Among other things, the French leader mentioned that historians should write 'a history of Europe' and France is ready to create the conditions for such work by historians.
A number of commentators immediately rushed to criticize Macron for pro-European propaganda and rewriting history.
In fact, it's more like they're trying to prevent history from being rewritten.
The far-right candidate for the French presidency, Éric Zemmour, is going around France right now arguing that the Vichy regime, which collaborated with Hitler during World War II, wasn't that bad, and he's having quite a bit of success with the French.
Let's try to take Macron's idea for a history textbook seriously and not look at what's happening in France.
Wouldn't that be necessary?
Students in European countries often learn history as a story of us versus them and never as a story of the whole.
The Spanish, the French, the Czechs find out who defeated whom in which battle.
But if they don't have an enlightened cantor, they won't know the broader context of the event.
The movie of the year is Quo vadis, Aida?
The Czech "Mice" didn't win.
The story, which goes back to the 1995 Srebrenica massacre, also won best director and best actress awards for Jasna Duričičová.
At this year's Karlovy Vary festival, he held on to the top of the audience rankings.
The best actor in Berlin was Anthony Hopkins for the film The Father.
I'm not very young, I'm not very healthy/fit and I'm not vaccinated.
It was kind of like "having the flu/being high" I had diarrhea for a few days and didn't really want to smoke...
Compared to the common flu, it was worse.
I don't have diarrhea with the flu.
(Only personal experience. I'm not saying everyone is.)

A tale of a return to roots that turns out to be nothing more than a longed-for illusion.
A bohemian and a comparativist, she brings the tale of Red Riding Hood to the backdrop of a contemporary village.

Trains are starting to run on a new timetable, there's a change of carrier somewhere.
From Sunday, trains will start running on the railway according to the new timetable.
The biggest change is the change of carriers on some routes, for example between Ústí nad Labem and Cologne, where RegioJet starts to run instead of České dráhy.
For most routes, only the departure time and, if necessary, the route will be slightly modified.
There will also be dozens of new trains on the tracks.
Carriers started selling tickets during the fall.
In the new timetable, Czech Railways plans to run an average of 6783 passenger services per day, of which 478 will be long-distance trains.
Trains will travel approximately 118 million kilometers during the new timetable.
In addition to national routes, the new timetable will also cover routes to Germany, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Austria and Switzerland.
The company will deploy dozens of new trains along with the new timetable.
The main novelty will be the InterJet trains, which will run on the lines from Prague to Cheb.
Other new trains will be operated by the carrier in northern Moravia or western Bohemia.
The carrier will also traditionally increase fares by an average of 3.2 percent from next year.
The railways take inflation into account in their tariffs every year.
The biggest change in RegioJet's timetable is the entry on the R23 line from Ústí nad Labem to Mělník to Nymburk to Cologne.
The carrier will replace the Czech Railways after success in the competition of the Ministry of Transport.
RegioJet will operate a total of 16 services per day, eight in each direction.
Other changes concern long-distance services between Prague and Brno, which will also stop at Havlíčkův Brod, Žďár nad Sázavou and Kolín stations from Sunday.
Leo Express maintained its 16 connections, two return connections to Slovakia and also a weekend connection to Kraków.
According to spokesman Emil Sedlarik, the carrier tried to maintain as similar as possible the running times of its long-distance trains, despite the planned lock-out work.
Without major changes, Arriva and other carriers' trains should continue to operate.
The carrier is also changed on some regional lines.
Changes await passengers, for example, in Czechoslovakia, where Trilex trains of the German company Die Länderbahn will run on the line from Mladá Boleslav through Česká Lípa to Rumburk instead of the Czech tracks.
For the second year, passengers will also be able to benefit from uniform railway fares.
As in the case of the Czech railways, their price increases by an inflation rate of 3,2%.
I have to disagree.
Aren't we learning the other side's point of view?
Everywhere we hear how much they had to fight for their rights, how they were oppressed and had to toil and die.
I've never heard a lesson in my life from the perspective of the slave party or the time, no one defending it, just condemning it.
No one even tells you in school that blacks were often sold into slavery by blacks themselves and that they were often the worst slave traders.
No one teaches you in school that the colonists often bought land from the Indians, they just tell you everywhere how brutally we Europeans slaughtered them, while they murdered each other long ago.
I also spent some time in the United States, directly in schools, both in northern and southern schools.
I haven't encountered anyone intentionally suppressing the facts, but I've heard it happen before and I think it's a problem, I don't deny it (for example, in Japan, WW2 atrocities are quite taboo).
My point was rather that history is not black and white, and that we tend to look at it from today's perspective, without understanding.
History doesn't care about one's feelings, it's just the way it is, and I think it's a fatal mistake to judge without looking at the facts of the time.
On the other hand, we should learn from it and never do it again.
By the way, speaking of those Southern states, yes, the Confederate flag and famous slave owners are quite popular there, but on the other hand, they had some good successes of their own, and I found it absurd to dismiss them.
Besides, the North wasn't much better than a lot of people idealize it to be these days.
And a lot of people also forget that not everyone in the South was a slaveholder, and a lot of things bothered them, too.
I wouldn't compare this to the Russians, they deliberately omit some facts, lie and manipulate, moreover, maybe our point of view doesn't exist with them (there was even a video on YT TV where they turned off someone who started talking about our legionnaires and 1968).
What I found ridiculous about U.S. schools was the rise of Marxism and the idealization of communism, something their country had never experienced.
Overall, I found that at some universities, it was shocking, these students were quite radicalized and the schools were very supportive of it.
And when I imagine that these people will one day be much older, it makes me a little bit sick that this could be the voice of the majority, because it's among the young and it's among the ruling elite.
It seems to me that maybe feminism has long since achieved what it had, and it's not about the same thing anymore, it's been radicalized.
Nowadays, feminists refer to those who have nothing to do with it and ignore a basic biological fact, as well as other groups such as LGBT, and this leads to radicalization on the other side, where it often leads to resistance even to quite reasonable things.
Besides, the more radical someone is, the more they're heard.
Anyway, to conclude, I've also never encountered anyone condemning me for colonialism or slavery.
More like I met the wrong geography, but it was mutual.:D
Not because I don't like it here, but because I think it's completely pointless.
Am I supposed to be proud of something I couldn't do on my own?
Furthermore, I consider the concept of nationality as a whole to be superfluous in terms of any personal identity.
If there's anything that connects me to people, it's interests, worldviews and shared experiences, not where we were born.
I'm not a believer, but from what I know, I can tell you this: we have two Greek Catholic parishes, one Ukrainian and one Slovak.
The Slovakian priest is a very nice guy, his sermons are more about theology than politics, but then he always screws up some shit about the coronavirus that everyone is ashamed of.
Then, of course, there is the Czechoslovak Hussite Church.
Officially, they're Protestants, but in fact, they're born Catholic moderns, and they're practically Catholics without a pope.
I know a lot of people who are Catholic, but they go to services with the Hussites, because it's very similar theologically, but the members are generally more liberal.
They have a beautiful and historically very valuable functionalist church on Botanica Street.
Otherwise, the church of St. Michael in the Dominican Square belongs to the Dominicans, and they even hold mass there every Sunday at 3:00 p.m. in Latin, as they did before Vatican II.
The flame of Bethlehem is in the Czech Republic, the scouts took it from Austria
Břeclav  The flame lit in Bethlehem, where, according to Christian tradition, Jesus Christ was born, is in the Czech Republic.
Due to the coronavirus pandemic, the scouts did not go to Vienna this time, but picked him up from their Austrian colleagues at the border crossing Reintal  Břeclav in the morning.
They picked him up at the border last year.
The Bethlehem Lights is a beautiful Christmas tradition that my squad and I participate in every year, and I look forward to it very much.
It is an honour for me to have been selected, said Amália Budíková, a scout, to the journalists present.
While last year the handover took place at the Mikulov-Drasenhofen border crossing, directly on the border bridge, now at the Reintal  Břeclav crossing in the car park.
But usually the scouts take the train to Vienna for him.
There is no change in the distribution of flame in the Czech Republic.
With the light of Bethlehem, the scouts traditionally set off by train first to Brno, where they hand it over to the diocesan bishop Vojtěch Cikrlem.
On Saturday, December 18, Scout couriers will take care of the subsequent distribution of the light, traveling by select express trains and passenger trains.
At the stations, the lights are taken over by local scouts or volunteers, who then continue to spread the flame throughout the Czech Republic, even where the tracks do not lead.
Once again this year, the Scouts must adhere to the current measures against the spread of the coronavirus.
It's the same as last year.
We recommend both the courier teams and the organizers of the local events to wear masks, of course, try to observe the distances, there are as few as possible, do not sing colleagues, just behave in a way that is as safe as possible, described the spokesperson of the Bethlehem Light event, Zuzana Hrbková.
The tradition of the Bethlehem Light travelling through Europe was born in Austria in 1986.
The aim is to spread the idea of peace, friendship and peace at the same time as the flame.
For believers, the light of Bethlehem is a symbol of hope, a light that overcomes darkness.
In the Czech Republic, Scouts and Girl Scouts have been taking care of its spread for more than 30 years.
The event relies on hundreds of volunteers, so the flame is also a symbol of selflessness and human reciprocity.
All updates, including a list of places where people can come for the flame, can be found on the website www.betlemskesvetlo.cz.
I don't have an economic education, so I don't know the fundamentals of economics that confirm that subsidies are the cancer of the economy, but I don't think subsidies as a whole would be a problem.
Infrastructure development, ecology (e.g. water retention), healthcare and education all use the money properly, I just don't understand why the money goes to agriculture, industry and companies in general.
As mentioned, it produces an unnecessary product and disrupts the free market and the 'natural life of the firm'.
I myself work in a factory where there are a million XYZ billboards in the hallways funded/co-funded by Project XYZ, and such a company is just kept alive artificially.
This is not supporting a company that gives jobs to x people, this is holding back development when this company somehow holds on and takes orders/employees from companies that could grow and be more productive after its demise
I totally agree, it's awful.
Occasionally, even a person born in the age of the Internet falls for a trick or a trap - advertising in particular.
Personally, I don't think I'm affected by Internet advertising, but then I find out that it's affected me too - it's just so worn out that you can't always avoid it.
That's why I support the radical voices in the European Parliament who want to ban programmatic (= targeted) advertising altogether...
It's all crap, in the words of the classics - I'd ban the Internet.
I have a feeling that this virus has its roots in (but mainly in point 1):
"I'm not going to believe something that the majority believes and it makes sense, I'm not a sheep, but I'd rather believe something that's less likely, it doesn't make much sense, but it's important that I have my own original opinion, which I'll claim is critical thinking".
"I'm not going to believe everything the media says".
3. "I don't trust the politicians"
Television has fallen out of the Christmas movie trend, with two hundred premiering this year.
Los Angeles  Cinemas, television stations, and streaming platforms in the United States and other English-speaking countries have embraced the trend of Christmas movies, premiering a record-breaking more than two hundred this year.
It was calculated by the operator of the IMDb movie database.
The genre of Christmas family and romance films has been gaining popularity and viewership in recent years, so more and more of these films are being made.
Four times as many Christmas movies were made this year as in 2011 and twice as many as five years ago.
IMDb has included only those movies that have the word "Christmas" in their titles, so there will actually be many more holiday movies.
The movies that people traditionally associate with Christmas have always existed.
In the Czech Republic, fairy tales are mainly associated with this period, worldwide films such as Alone at Home, Love from Heaven or the classic Christmas story Life is Beautiful from 1946 are also popular.
The real Christmas movie boom, however, did not begin until 2009, when a special film series was launched by the American cable television network Hallmark.
Her adventure project, Countdown to Christmas, included four films at the time and was very successful.
This year, the station began tuning its viewers for Christmas on October 22 and will present a total of 42 Christmas films.
Competitor Lifetime has 35 new Christmas-themed movies on its schedule this year, with popular streaming platforms such as Netflix contributing to the total.
"At this magical time, the story doesn't really matter, the important thing is that there are lots of Christmas trees in the background and it's snowing", Brandon Gray, author of a book on Christmas movies called I'll Be Home for Christmas Movies, described the genre with exaggeration.
"For the audience, it's a form of escape and a way to at least for two hours feel a little bit of peace in the midst of all the holiday madness and the madness of the world that we've been living in for the last couple of years", Gray added.
According to him, for example, Hallmark still uses the same recipe for its films, which is uniform but successful.
You've got two people falling in love, but then about half an hour before the end there's some misunderstanding, which of course is resolved, and the two of them kiss.
It's like this all the time, and as long as all the movies look the same and have the same vibe, people watch one after the other, Gray adds.
Mazepin has tested positive for COVID-19, so he's out of action until the final race of F1.
Only nineteen drivers will be competing in the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix in Formula One.
Nikita Mazepin has tested positive for COVID-19 and will be out of action until the final race of the season.
The Haas stable will only send one formula to the track.
In the final race of the season, he had to attack for a better position from the 20th place he had taken in qualifying.
However, the Russian Nikita Mazepin from the Haas stable will ultimately not enter the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.
He tested positive for COVID-19.
With only nineteen cars on the grid, Mazepin's teammate Mick Schumacher, from the first Max Verstappen, who will face Lewis Hamilton in a head-to-head title battle, will take to the track from the last corner.
Mazepin, according to the Haas stable, is in relatively good shape and exhibiting no symptoms.
Nikita's physically fine because he was asymptomatic.
She is now in isolation and will follow the guidance of the relevant public health authorities, with safety being the ultimate priority for all concerned", her representatives told formula1.com.
Haas will not and cannot send a replacement rider to the race.
A possible substitute would have to qualify or race in a different part of the weekend.
COVID-19 doesn't affect the first rider.
At the start of the season, Kimi Räikkönen tested positive for COVID-19, and last year, Sergio Pérez and Lewis Hamilton tested positive.
You could go to jail for this, too.
And nobody cares what the boss said.
From the point of view of the law, covid is on the list of contagious diseases.
That's in the same group as HIV, the plague, yellow fever or typhus.
Section 152 Spread of a contagious human disease
(1) A person who intentionally causes or increases the risk of introducing or spreading a contagious disease in humans shall be punished by imprisonment from six months to three years, a ban on activity or confiscation of property.
(2) The offender shall be punished by imprisonment for two to eight years,
(c) if by so doing he breaches an important duty arising out of his employment, profession, position or office or imposed on him by law; or
(d) if, by doing so, he causes serious harm to health.
(3) A person shall be punished by a term of imprisonment of between three and ten years if, by an act referred to in paragraph 1, he causes serious bodily injury or death to at least two persons.
(4) The offender shall be punished by a term of imprisonment of between five and twelve years if he causes the death of at least two persons by an act referred to in paragraph 1.

Gold, silver and 150 diamonds, the price tag of the most expensive sweater will blow your mind!
It's kind of like a portable jewelry store, and the creator put six months of work and all his savings into it.
"I had a vision of what I wanted to create, but little experience, sweaters were never worn much at home", admits Liban, who spent 3,000 hours on his work in six months.
The silk was bought in Italy, the 24-karat gold thread in France, and the 2,000 ornamental crystals were supplied by the Swarowski firm.
The silver stars were then embellished with 150 diamonds.
The foundation is wool and cotton, but silk gives the sweater its softness, it praises the creator of its work, which, of course, it does not recommend washing.
And there's another catch.
"I'm completely broke, I need to sell my sweater as soon as possible", Lebanon admits.
If he succeeds, he will set a world record.
The most expensive sweater to date, sold five years ago, cost only 720,000.

The government has approved the deployment of up to 150 troops to help Poland.
Female explorers and drone pilots could be deployed before Christmas, the mission is approved for six months.
They are to assist their Polish colleagues in protecting the border with Belarus and in the construction of the planned fence.
Poland has officially asked for help from NATO countries in connection with the months-long actions of the Belarusian regime, which invites citizens of Middle Eastern countries to its territory with the false promise of easy crossing of the EU border.
British and Estonian troops are already operating on Polish soil.
The Omicron mutation is spreading to southern Moravia?
Hygiene is investigating another case of Adam's baby.
We're currently reporting another suspected case of this variant in another child from Adam's prep class.
Direct contact with previous cases from Adamov's clinic is not proven, Ciupek said.
There have been six cases in the county this week.
We are still waiting for the official confirmation of the variant in our six cases it is being carried out by the National Reference Laboratory for Influenza and Non-Influenza Viruses of the State Health Institute in Prague,said the Director.
She added that they were two nurses from one of the workplaces of the Brno University Hospital and two children of one of them, as well as two eleven-year-old students of Adamov Secondary School.
There is no connection between the cases in Brno and Adamov.
Three of them have mild symptoms, according to the director, four are asymptomatic.
No one with suspected Omicron has traveled abroad
None of the above have traveled abroad, nor have any of their families, nor have they been in contact with anyone residing abroad.
There is no connection to the water polo championship for any of the above, Ciupek said.
Chief hygienist Pavla Svrčinová previously stated that an international water polo tournament that was held in Brno a few weeks ago is being investigated.
There were also players from South Africa, and one Belgian player got sick after returning.
California's going to restrict the sale of guns.
He wants to do the Texas abortion ban.
California Governor Gavin Newsom on Saturday announced plans to ban the sale and manufacture of certain weapons in America's most populous state, using the same legal mechanism used by Texas in its controversial law against abortions performed after the detection of an embryonic heartbeat.
The people would then be entitled to compensation for suing anyone who manufactures or sells assault rifles and homemade firearms in California.
Newsom's announcement was in response to a U.S. Supreme Court opinion Friday that upheld Texas' abortion ban, even though it goes against a nearly 50-year-old precedent that established a right to abortion nationwide by about 24 months of pregnancy.
However, the Court did not now rule on the constitutionality of the law as a whole, but on a technical issue arising from the innovative design of the measure.
In fact, the enforcement of the injunction was transferred to the public in this case, making it impossible for Texas Republicans to challenge it through the usual judicial channels.
"I am outraged by yesterday's (Friday) decision by the United States Supreme Court, which upheld the Texas ban on most abortion services and largely supported Texas' maneuver to protect its law", the California governor said.
"If states can now block federal courts from reviewing their laws, then California will use that power to protect people's lives", Newsom continues.
He allegedly instructed his subordinates, in cooperation with the state parliament and the minister of justice, to work on measures that would empower public representatives to enforce the ban on assault rifles and so-called ghost weapons.
That's what they call homemade guns that don't have serial numbers and can be used to circumvent regulations.
Newsom wants "private citizens" to have the right to demand at least $10,000 in damages and legal fees from anyone who manufactures, distributes, or sells assault rifles, "ghost gun" parts, or kits to manufacture them in California.
"If the most effective way to keep these terrible weapons off our streets is to create the threat of private lawsuits, then that's exactly what we should do", said the governor of California.
AP notes that California has banned the manufacture and sale of certain military-style weapons for decades, but in June a federal judge blocked the ban as unconstitutional.
If the state were to actually reinstate the ban using the Texas template, it would confirm the words of liberal Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who warned against extending the legal mechanism to other U.S. states in a dissenting opinion to Friday's majority verdict.
The Supreme Court, however, did not grant Texas' abortion ban complete immunity from judicial review, allowing abortion clinics to pursue lawsuits against select officials in the southern U.S. state.
Every emergency vaccination has a public testing phase, where the vaccine regimen is developed and the vaccines themselves are improved based on the results.
In Israel, for example, there's already a large-scale study on the effects of four doses.
And according to these studies, most patients experience up to a five-fold increase in antibodies, which already has the long-term effect you mentioned.
It's just like any other vaccination, it's going to have its own vaccination schedule over time, it's just too early for that.
Another fact is that a new vaccine, based on an inactivated virus, that promises to be up to 10 times more effective, according to the manufacturer's specifications, should be on the market shortly.

Poland threatened to stop payments to the EU budget
According to Ziobra, it would be unlawful for the European Commission to use its new powers to stop the disbursement of funds to Poland because of the rule of law dispute.
The Commission has already postponed approval of Poland's plan to draw EUR 36 billion from the EU recovery fund for economies hit by the COVID-19 pandemic.
And it is under pressure from the European Parliament to go further and use a mechanism to withdraw EU subsidies from countries violating the rule of law.
Poland should respond to this EU blackmail with a veto on all matters requiring unanimity, said Ziobro, head of the small Solidarity Poland party, without whose votes the current government would have lost its narrow majority in the Sejm.
Poland should also consider its commitments in EU energy and climate policy, which lead to a drastic increase in energy prices,added Ziobro.
If the dispute continues, I will demand that Poland stop its contributions to the EU.
It would be justifiable given that the EU is illegally withholding funds from the common budget, to which we also contribute, the Polish minister added.
His party's approach to the EU is more radical than that of the ruling Law and Justice party.
According to the European Commission, the changes that the Polish judiciary has undergone under Ziobro's leadership threaten its independence and subordinate it to politicians.
According to Ziobro, Brussels is setting 'impossible conditions' because its goal is not the rule of law but a change of government in Poland.
Warsaw faces 'a political dictatorship carried out by blackmail and an attempt to undermine the democratic decisions of several million Poles', Ziobro also said.
He stated that Poland should be a member of an EU based on a partnership of sovereign states, not a government of the strongest and a Brussels bureaucracy that is not under democratic control.
He said that his party would never accept such concessions from Brussels as would result in limiting Poland's sovereignty.
"We will never agree to Poland having the status of a colony", he said.
But to get the hang of it, we have the same kind of cheese at Lidl in four different places.
I didn't look for other things, I came across one yogurt too many times, all I needed was cheese, parmesan, after ten minutes at the milk shelves, I gave up and asked.
They had it, it's true, in that narrow sector there were all the select, less common and special cheeses, but it was between the vegetables and the lactose-free zone...
If there's avoidance, I don't even go to the market anymore, action or not, the gold store in the square, they may not have such a selection, but they usually have everything I need and it has some order, so I'm done in ten minutes.
To Lidl to take a vacation.
And I don't care about that anymore.
For two years, I've watched this place treat data like shit, and most anti-vaccinationists are just a little bit more off base than most pro-vaccinationists.
There's a rational discussion going on at the professional level, but only extreme views are getting into the public sphere.
Constantly from wall to wall.
Binary thinking: vaccines are going to save us, vaccines are useless.
Banning all, allowing all.
Colourful cakes instead of robust analyses.
Comparing apples to pears.
This state is like that, and we're like that.

Wow, that's a relief.
Sorry about the spill, and have a nice day.
When I was a kid, they used to punish me with a stove.
It was never because of my grades, but mostly because of my repeated refusal to obey and my bad temper (reading instead of going to bed, fighting with my brother, etc.).
At the same time, I was never punished without warning, my mother always first threatened that if I did it again, I would get hit (sometimes even after another "catch", she would only bring the stove and put it down so that I could see it).
Only after I repeatedly refused to obey did I receive a few blows to the buttocks (through my clothes).
Personally, I think that physical punishment (in reasonable amounts) is beneficial because a child responds to it much more than to words.
What's important, I think, is the warning part, because it kind of gives the child a choice between disobeying and getting it, or getting better and not being punished.
In the end, I usually just needed a warning to start listening.
Defence of the system
When the prominent Czech lawyer and constitutional judge Vojtěch Cepl in 1999 answered a journalist's question about what the Czech Constitution means to him  whether it is a sacred document on which he swears and which he has been taught since childhood in school or, on the contrary, an agreement that can be changed if necessary, he decidedly leaned towards the first concept.
Once we agreed in the Constitution on the democratic rules of our lives, which at the same time define who we are as a state and its citizens, it's better to spare change.
And just think: some nations have rules they even like.
Just as the Czechs love dumplings with pork and cabbage, Vojtěch Cepl was asking the question at the time.
Recently, however, there has been a growing opinion among lawyers that the Constitution of the Czech Republic needs to be amended.
The year is tested by situations that its creators (including Vojtěch Cepl) could not have foreseen, such as the behavior of a directly elected president.
But Cepl was right about one thing.
Everything we know about such documents indicates that political interference with their texts must be considered.
The Constitution must be understood and actively defended, only then can it be the key to overcoming most of the crises that societies have faced throughout history.
Among other things, the constitution is a kind of order of government consisting of individual rules that set the rules of the game for politicians.
We fear that power will be abused against minorities or individuals, so we ban politicians.
At the same time, constitutional texts also allow politicians to exercise their power.
Covid doesn't choose, FN Brno is fighting for the life of a few-month-old baby
Although the coronavirus is known to be milder for children, there are also severe cases that hospitals have been dealing with especially recently.
"We know that children are less at risk and affected than adults, we are talking about 2 to 5 percent compared to adults", Petr Dominik, head of the Pediatric Anesthesiology and Resuscitation Clinic at Brno University Hospital and Masaryk University Faculty of Medicine, told Novinka.
The course tends to be much simpler, lighter, often symptom-free.
But there are pediatric patients who are seriously ill with coronavirus, which we have seen especially in the recent period", added Dominik.
According to the doctor, there are dozens of children in need of mild supportive care.
It takes place in a pediatric infectious disease clinic.
Really very seriously ill children with coronavirus have only recently been in the ARU.
Children with post-covid syndromes have been in the doctor's ward continuously throughout the year.
'There is now an increase in children with acute covid pneumonia, i.e. pneumonia requiring resuscitation beds,' he said, adding that the disease affects both adolescents and several-month-old babies in addition to adults.
There are also children in critical condition in hospitals because of the coronavirus.
We currently have a child aged several months as well as an adolescent in our care,said the headmistress.
However, he is pleased that no child deaths from coronavirus have been recorded at FN Brno Children's Hospital so far.
According to the available data, six children aged 0 to 14 years died in the Czech Republic on 6 December.
According to Dominic, a psychologist is an integral part of the collaboration at the children's hospital, not only in the coronavirus ward.
It also draws attention to the fact that, as in adults and children, vaccination reduces the course of the disease and at the same time reduces the incidence of post-covid syndrome.
"That's why we recommend the vaccine dose be given to children as well", the doctor added.
In the quiet zone, you can only walk along marked paths.
But the quiet zones aren't that big.
They can be seen on the tourist map on maps.cz.
In general, in national parks outside the quiet zone, you can walk anywhere (but don't climb over the fence into the enclosure).
Skiing/biking in the woods off the marked roads is not allowed anywhere unless you have an exemption (but of course it's not that much monitored outside of the national parks).
How does the conductor practice?
The music is in my head, Josef Kurfiřt is laughing.
It's rooted in Liberec opera and originally played on a forest horn.
As a singer he can sing practically any repertoire and as a conductor he works not only in the Liberec Theatre of F. Šalda, but also in Plzeň, in the Theatre of Josef Kajetán Tyla.
He collaborates with the Château Philharmonic Orchestra, the Film Philharmonic Orchestra and the Podkrkonoše Symphony Orchestra.
China is giving the impression that the epidemic is under control and that the authoritarian regime is coping better with the crisis
Sinolog Jiroush: China is building the impression that the epidemic is under control and that the authoritarian regime is coping better with the crisis.
China has launched both a medical and a political offensive.
A few months ago, Beijing was responding to criticism for failing to stop the disease from becoming a global pandemic.
Now the country is reporting zero new infections.
Countries including the Czech Republic are competing for Chinese protective equipment, and Chinese doctors are helping to fight the coronavirus in many places, including Italy, which is the hardest hit.
How do you see Beijing's willingness?
Is it friendly support or is the communist regime trying to improve its image in the world?
A friend meets a friend and says, "Hey, do you want an elephant?"
I got it, and it's great.
My wife loves it because she mows the lawn, she washes the car with a stump, the kids play with it.
Well, that's just great.
If you want 5,000, I'll sell you an elephant.
Friend: All right, we're going to clap, it's going to be great...
After a while, they meet and the buyer complains: Dude, what did you sell for an elephant????
The lawn's all messed up, there's giant shit all over the place, the car's flattened, the kids are scared of it, and the wife wants a divorce.
The guy who sold it says, "You talk bad about an elephant, you can't sell an elephant like that".
World affairs are controlled by the great powers.
Although sovereign nations are equal, it is the great powers that determine the course of international affairs.
Europe can only become such a great power if it works towards its integration.
So far, it is functioning at the economic and political level (on selected issues), but military integration is still lacking.
Personally, I think that Europe is moving towards federalisation.
It won't be in 10, 15 or 20 years.
But maybe by mid-century, the mood will be different, and it will work.
That's what I was thinking, and it's entirely possible.
I'm not an expert in Czech, so maybe I'm a lexicographer.
I'm just assuming that an ellipse usually involves two different units on the same plane.
To borrow an example from another comment, Spanish oranges and tangerines are clearly both from Spain, whereas Spanish fruits and tangerines are not clearly both from Spain.
Besides, I'm basing this on the fact that the phrase sounds like "all American forces", including their weapons, and that I know that American facilities are operated by Americans only.
In other words, I expect it's already included in the broad term and there's no need to specify it further for American forces.
But then again, maybe I'm just a wordsmith:D
Either way, it's an unreasonable request.

Vicki Holland from the UK tortured the space monkey Milly
The frightening footage shows a frightened monkey crouching in a toilet bowl before being flushed out and laughed at by its callous owner.
Holland's monkey was also fed sausages, kebabs and hamburgers, regardless of its actual nutritional needs.
A magistrate's court in Gwent has now banned her from keeping animals for life, reports The Sun.
The monkey rehabilitation specialists who are caring for Milly after her abuse say they've never seen an alien so terrified.
Milly has spent nearly two years in rehabilitation with Monkey World staff in Dorset and is now happily playing with another rescued monkey named Moon.
The mother of four pleaded guilty to two counts of causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal.
At the Magistrates' Court in Gwent, she was given a 12-week suspended sentence suspended for one year.
Holland was also sentenced to 120 hours of unpaid work, banned from keeping animals for life, and ordered to pay a total of CZK 12,000 in court costs.
The leader of the Small Monkeys team that rehabilitated the abused animal, Steph Sawyer, said, "Milly is fine, but the rehabilitation will continue".
It took Milly a while to get used to people again.
She would crouch and hide from everyone she met, and any loud sound or sudden movement would make her scream.
The monkey refused to eat for a long time.
Even now, when she's settled and satisfied with a male, the sight of new people can still cause her to panic.
The psychological scars of abuse will haunt her forever, Sawyer adds.
Milly's harassment came to light after police in Gwent discovered frightening footage in her wife's phone following a raid on her apartment over a drug charge.
You can hear Milly swearing in the footage.
In the next video, you can hear Holland's monkey offering cocaine and saying, "Do you want cocaine?"
Then lick my fingers.
In May, she and her partner, Russell Cox, 43, admitted to possession of cocaine with intent to sell.
At her home, £1,600 worth of cocaine was found hidden in Kinder eggs.
Cox was subsequently jailed for 30 months and Holland was given a 20-month suspended sentence.

And it kills the whole idea of biffling, where no one, with very few exceptions, cares if you can do it or understand it.
Just write the test to 1 and then no one cares.
Go and ask random people on the street if you can figure out the character of the roots of a quadratic equation and the coefficients.
They've all been there, and the vast majority won't even cross a line and tell you they don't give a shit.
Then what the fuck is he studying for?
I'm a big fan of the overview, and the reality is that people don't want to and they don't need to.
And at that point, it's pointless, and you'll never get it into them anyway.
It's partly learning for the many people who are going to need this and that.
But, like, the comment that you don't really need all this stuff to stand at the machine, I meant it very seriously......because you just don't.
Plus, we're slowly getting to the point where not knowing is the hallmark of punk.
But the cost of having barbarians stand by these machines is simply too high.
If journalists could do the math, covid probably never would have reached this size.
The wedding at first sight, the Kadri-Andreya war continues!
Which is the main reason why she can't leave Switzerland right away", Andrea replied on Instagram in Stories to the perennial questions of curious fans, what she was so disappointed in Kadrim that she decided to end all contact and even block him on social networks.
There's been a rift between Kadri and Andrea since the beginning of the experiment.
The main problem was the fact that Kadri lived and worked in Switzerland, and his idea was that Andrea would move in with her, at least until she returned to the Czech Republic permanently.
But she adamantly refused.
And as you can see, their relationship not only did not end in love, but rather grew from mutual disrespect to hatred.
It was a premeditated attack on your part! was angered by Kadri's reversal in response to Andrea's accusations of lying, gambling and debt.
Kadri's alleged honesty was now frowned upon by his ex-wife and his younger sister Linda.
She decided to publicly defend her brother.
I don't normally comment on things like this, and we've never really talked about it as a family.
I certainly don't want to cause any regret.
But when I see someone trying to publicly hurt and smear the name of someone I love so much, I just can't take it!
I'm sorry to have to do it this way, but I would like to take this opportunity to publicly thank my brother Kadri for turning himself into a character and helping our family when we needed it most despite his young age.
It makes me even more sorry to read such false information, which is probably quite taken out of context.
I wish so much that everyone knew Kadri as I, our loved ones and family, stand in faith in response to Andrea's words.
I am truly grateful to him for everything!
Of course people will believe what is written, but the most important thing is that we, his family, love him above all and we know the facts and we know how it really was, she added vaguely.
A drunken thief climbed up the facade to the fifth floor.
You won't believe what it's for.
Cchao began his robbery expedition in a parking lot in a residential neighborhood, where he attempted to break into several cars.
According to available information, he eventually stole less than 330 crowns from one vehicle.
After that, he had no choice but to climb to the fifth floor and enter the apartment through an open window.
That's where he stole two bananas.
One of the security cameras then caught him walking down the street away from the crime scene, eating a banana.
When the owner of the apartment woke up in the morning, he found that the bananas were not where they were, and he called the police.
She subsequently detained Chao.
The man confessed to drinking some alcohol on the day of the crime.
And since he needed the money, he decided to rob in a drunken stupor.
The whole thing is still under investigation.
A drunk climbed up the facade to the fifth floor, where he stole two bananas.
The pandemic law is limited in time and in effectiveness to the pandemic emergency.
If it's repealed, the law won't take effect.
Although the law limits the scope of business
Isn't that reason enough for you?
The right of assembly will be restricted, but not abolished.
More than 60 percent of voters turned out for Saturday's elections in four municipalities.
On Saturday, people voted in the municipalities of Komňa in Hungary, Lužice in the Czech Republic, Nová Ves in Liberec and Rovné in the Czech Republic.
The number of councillors in these municipalities has fallen below the number laid down by law or the elected councils have been dissolved.
A total of 28 seats were contested by 99 candidates on Saturday.
The average age of newly elected representatives is 46.7 years.
The oldest is 69 years old, the youngest 33.
The processing of the results of Saturday's elections symbolically closes a rather difficult but successful year for us.
There were a total of four new or repeated elections to municipal councils and, above all, the closely watched elections to the Chamber of Deputies, said Eva Krumpová, vice-president of the ČSÚ.
She recalled that due to the COVID-19 epidemic, the elections were more demanding in terms of equipment and personnel security.
In the Hungarian Chamber of Deputies, the Association of Independent Candidates won Saturday's elections with 27.76 percent of the vote and two seats in the seven-member assembly.
The STAN candidate received 24.84 percent of the vote, which also means a gain of two seats.
Two seats in the House of Representatives were also won by Citizens for the Commons, who received 18.52% of the vote.
Once again, the current mayor of the municipality, Jana Křižková, who is a member of Soukromniki, got into the council for them.
For one seat in the Chamber of Deputies, the Communists won  independent candidates.
Turnout was 75.48 percent of eligible voters.
In the village of Rovna in Pelhřimovsk won the association Pro Rovnou.
It won 50.50 percent of the vote, which means four seats out of seven.
Two more representatives from the Association of Independent Candidates 1 and one from the Association of Independent Candidates 2 were elected to the municipal council.
Voter turnout was 93.62 percent.
The repeated elections in Lužica na Mostecku were again won by the Lužica and Svinčica Association led by Mayor Jindřich John.
It won 56.73% of the vote and, as in 2018, has four seats in the seven-member Chamber of Deputies.
Second place went to the candidate of the Municipality for the People, who was voted by 43.27 percent of voters, so she will have three representatives in the House of Representatives.
Turnout was 76.7 percent.
The election in New Village in Liberec was won by the independent candidates of Hope for New Village ahead of the ANO Movement.
The Alliance of Independent Candidates received 59.88 percent of the votes and won four seats in the seven-member city council.
ANO received 40.12 percent of the vote and against a proper election in 2018 it strengthened, gaining one more mandate and having three.
Voter turnout was 42.9 percent.
On Monday, the results of the election will be discussed by the State Election Commission.
Thereafter, they shall be published in the Collection of Laws.
What do you think would be a bigger problem?
A dead civilian or a dead foreign politician?
I think you know all this stuff that people write to you.
You're just playing dumb so you have someone to "fight" with.
If not, that's sad.
I'm not saying that Christians are degenerates or anything like that.
I even like a lot of church buildings from an aesthetic point of view (which was the goal, after all, to make them look good).
And I don't really care what anyone believes.
On the other hand, what bothers me is how much power the church had in the Middle Ages, how much money it made, the suppression of science, and so on.
Not to mention all the wars she's caused, like the 30-year-old
You may believe in the spaghetti monster, but the state and the church have nothing to do together.
A man fell headfirst from 40 feet.
He survived the impact on the concrete.
A man in Ostrava survived an unbelievable fall on Sunday night when he was rescued by paramedics from the Regional Medical Rescue Service.
County operations center workers responded to an emergency call an hour after midnight Saturday with preliminary information about a man falling from a height.
Two U.S. Air Force medical and paramedic crews were immediately dispatched to the scene.
Upon arriving at the scene, paramedics discovered that the 27-year-old man had fallen from a window about 40 feet [12 m] and hit his head on the concrete!
There's been a coal strike in Vítkovic.
But not the way it was supposed to be, and the fire department went to work.
By the time rescue teams arrived, the man was unconscious, with multiple injuries and life-threatening injuries.
The intervening doctor intubated his respiratory tract, provided artificial pulmonary ventilation, and after further pre-hospital emergency care measures, an ambulance transported him to further care at the Ostrava trauma center, said Lukáš Humpl, a spokesman for the ZZS MS region.
More worrying than the coronavirus is the inadequate response of the public and the authorities.
The spread of the coronavirus in the Czech Republic represents a challenge for politicians and officials, but doctors and medical staff are on the front line of the fight against infection.
How serious is the situation from their point of view?
We're going to ask military physician David Cutter.

The legendary Nunes fell after seven years, Oliveira defended the belt
MMA had a great gala night with some interesting results.
Because things were happening at UFC 269.
Outsider Julianna Peña was able to defeat legendary wrestler Amanda Nunes, who hadn't found a slayer in seven years.
In the lightweight division, Charles Oliveira didn't hesitate to deliver a great throttle to Dustin Poirier and defend his belt.
The victory was also claimed by Kai Kara-France, who quickly knocked out Cody Garbrandt with a technical knockout in the first round.
His opponent was also defeated by Sean O'Malley.
A surprise that no one expected.
It was the women's bantamweight match between the world-famous Amanda Nunes and Julianna Peña.
The American entered the battle as an imaginary dwarf, as Nunes had not lost in seven years and gritted her teeth for another triumph.
In addition, the beginning of the duel was carried out in the spirit of paper assumptions.
Nunes started the road to victory very actively and even gave her opponent a push kick that sent her to the ground.
However, Peña did not allow herself to be forced to make any more mistakes and unsuccessfully attempted to attack herself with a hand lever.
The second round was thrilling and very exciting for MMA fans.
Both fighters boasted plenty of excellent punches and hard hooks.
Plus, Penny got Nunes on the ground, where she started strangling her.
She had to give up and launch her attack.
The American woman has given everyone a huge shock when she became the new champion.
The highlight of the evening was the lightweight title fight between Charles Oliveira and Dustin Poirier.
Although Poirier initially fared better, the tables began to turn.
In the second, he tried to be more active Oliveira, who tried to stab his opponent with a lever on his hand.
That didn't work out too well, but then he put a lot of pressure on himself, got his opponent on his back, and dealt him a series of blows.
That's how he won the second round.
In the third round, Oliveira showed a rear naked choke, which Poirier resisted for a while, but subsequently had to knock the choke off.
The Brazilian defended his title, but Poirier lost after two years.
In the next match, Sean O'Malley claimed the supreme triumph by putting a hard right back on Raulian Paeva in the first round.
Subsequently, he struck him with a series of precise punches, recording his fifteenth triumph.
Kara-France was able to deal with Cody Garbrandt.
In the spring, Nunes celebrated another triumph with her young daughter, this time losing after seven years.
The hip or the hip?
At first glance, it's not that complicated.
Most nouns in the Czech language express only one grammatical gender, so it is not difficult to determine whether they are masculine, feminine, or intermediate.
Then there is also a fairly large group of nouns for which the genus is not established.
Such nouns fluctuate between two families.
When bent, they become double-edged and in some cases remain unbent.
For example, the words svízel or kyčel are both masculine and feminine, in the former they are inflected according to the pattern stroj, in the latter according to the pattern píseň.
For another group of nouns, there are different forms already in the first declension of the uniform number, for example: reed/row, kedluben/kedlubna or brambor/brambora (in the sense of food).
Both forms are literary, have the same meaning, and are therefore freely interchangeable.
Some expressions may differ regionally, for example okurka in Bohemia and okurek in Moravia, but in this case the Moravian variant is unspelled, as are other Czech-Moravian pairs of words: příkop and příkopa, kobliha and koblih, etc.
Some words that have entered the Czech language from other languages were originally non-inclined, but gradually they take over the Czech endings.
A typical example is the expression image, which is both masculine and feminine, or the word bufet, which has remained in the middle gender unflattered, but in the masculine has endings following the pattern of hrad.
Turkey has opened the way for migrants to Europe.
What's the situation right on the Greek border?
There is tension on the Greek-Turkish border due to the increasing number of migrants trying to get further into Europe.
Thousands of people started moving towards the southern border of the Schengen area after Ankara stopped blocking them.
European politicians are pledging support to Greece, and the Czech government is also planning humanitarian aid.
What motivates refugees to make such an uncertain journey?
And what's the situation on the ground?
We hadn't seen blue skies for three months, and we were suffocating, says a Sydney journalist
The devastating fires that have ravaged Australia for four months have killed nearly three dozen people, hundreds of millions of animals, and millions of acres of land.
How are the authorities and the people coping?
Could Prime Minister Morrison's government have done more to prevent the drastic impacts that critics claim?
And what will the earth have to do to prepare for the future with regard to climate change?
Lenka Kabrhel is speaking with Sydney journalist Ika Detrich.
False accusations have always been and are quite rare.
That's why it's always written about everyone everywhere.
People are uncomfortable with what sexual violence looks like in our society and how rampant it is, so they try to cover it up.
I don't personally know anyone who's been falsely accused.
But I know a lot of people who have been raped and I've seen how these people are often treated by their neighbors or even the police.
A victim should always be trusted.
The trend has been for victims to finally open up about their traumas.
Still, too many people keep it to themselves.
Yes, there are those who falsely accuse others.
It's disgusting and spitting in the face of all victims of sexual violence, but by spreading the idea that "much of the accusation is fabricated" and that it's a "trend", you're only helping the perpetrators of sexual violence.
The Czech Republic is flooded with unbuilt houses, families don't have the money to finish
The prices of building materials have risen by more than 30 percent in recent weeks and months.
A lot of people have gotten into trouble because of it.
She doesn't have the funds to finish the single-family homes being built, and the banks are refusing to extend her mortgage.
In addition to the cost of materials, the cost of construction work is increasing.
As a result, people do not have enough money to complete existing single-family homes.
In many cases, banks refuse to extend mortgages to them, creating an extremely unpleasant situation.
At best, people are moving into abandoned and unbuilt homes.
In the worst-case scenario, the demolished houses are uninhabitable and families are forced to sell them because they cannot afford to pay their mortgages and rent", says BHS economist Štěpán Křeček.
We build two or three single-family houses a year, and 50 percent of the time, we've done it.
The difficulty for us as a construction company is that we have to adhere to certain things in the contract, even if the material has gone up in price.
So we work without earnings", said the owner of the construction company Zdeněk Slivoň.
A lot of people are going to have financial problems.
If they were counting on their house costing five million to build, now it's going to cost them seven.
I think some will wait", added Slivoň.
The most expensive materials were copper, iron, and plumbing and heating equipment.
But construction firms are also struggling with labor shortages.
There is a shortage of construction graduates in the Czech Republic, and the influx of foreign workers is hampered by the pandemic.
At the moment, only the situation regarding the issuing of building permits is more favourable.
The building authorities issued 7 675 building permits in October, almost 10 per cent more than a year earlier,said Mr Křeček.
We're doing well, and we're going to do even better.
But the real vision is missing, says commentator ČRO  myRozhlas
Traditionally, in addition to traditional celebrations, political speeches have accompanied the entrance of the new year.
This year, in addition to the Prime Minister and Chairman of the ANO Andrej Babiš and the Christmas message of President Miloš Zeman, the presidents of the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies also addressed the nation.
What important lessons have we learned?
I've got my own subject that I've chosen, I'm following up on my bachelor's, I'm always working on it all year, and then in a week or two I'm writing the written part.
The State Department is cool with it. Unless you're a total jerk and you've got something left in your head, the committee won't choke you on theory.
I mean, I was studying to be a statesman for a week, and when I was at the end, the commission always tried to lead me to some logical deduction, which I got right away, and I was right.
Unlike those projects, I know people who pay someone to do the semester project for them (we've done it many times, it's really beneficial, it teaches a lot) and then they just learn the project and they're done.
I think it's great that at the end of the course, there's a test that reflects the knowledge gained from the project, not just the defense.
All right, but don't intercept e-mails and phone calls, and don't send any packages to the embassy.
You'll be just as much of a dick as they are.
Those people at the embassy might not have anything to do with it.
And if they're against Russia, they're taking a big risk, so maybe they have to play them, because otherwise something could happen to them.
But you might as well put a similar statue of Putin next to a statue of Pooh.
Maybe even put it so that it hits Xi Jinping's ass or something.
I agree, even though Insta keeps throwing sticks at artists.
As long as you don't post stories every day and at least a new picture every other day, your reach will be reduced to a bare minimum.
Plus, they keep changing which feature is more important, like, comment or save.
It's been really pissing me off lately, so I might have to reduce myself to a tic-tac-toe, where a lot of artists in my industry are having success and barely allowing it.
At the end of the day, I'd probably like to see something more user-friendly that doesn't suck all the creativity and energy out of artists.
Statement by the Party of Workers of Donbass
Union  yes, dissolution  no, opponents of the dissolution of the USSR express their opinion in the picture.
Thirty years since the illegal dissolution of the USSR.
On December 8th, 1991, the greatest geopolitical catastrophe in the history of mankind took place.
In the White Forest on December 8, 1991, Boris Yeltsin, Leonid Kravchuk and Stanislav Shushkevich, without any legal powers and in violation of the results of the referendum of March 17, 1991, with the openly tolerant attitude of Mikhail S. Gorbachev, secretly, regardless of the people, signed an agreement that "the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics as a subject of international law and as a geopolitical reality ceases to exist".
With the stroke of a pen, they wiped out a vast country of nearly three hundred million people.
With the collapse of the Soviet Union, tens of millions of ethnic Russian citizens found themselves abroad.
Since the early 1990s, Russia's population has declined by 10 to 11 million.
Even without the loss of the non-Russian population of the former Soviet republics, we have already lost more people than in the two world wars combined!
Even earlier, the same people who, in one sitting in the Belyovzhsk Forest, destroyed what had been built over the previous seventy years, betrayed the socialist camp (created at the cost of millions of lives in World War II and the Great Patriotic War).
They deliberately de-industrialized, crippled agriculture, cut off from the world's greatest power 14 republics that had previously been economically linked into a single mechanism.
If we want to look even deeper, then we see the impoverishment of the population, the breakdown of the economy, science, the military, the growth of crime, inter-ethnic conflicts, the war in Chechnya, all the conflicts in the post-Soviet space, the series of orange revolutions, the expansion of NATO to the east, the war and the break-up of Yugoslavia, the Arab Spring, the war in Syria - all this is the result of geopolitical capitulation, the surrender of the socialist camp first, and then the Soviet Union.
There's a term in political science called a "vacuum of power".
Everything that was hastily betrayed and surrendered was quickly filled and conquered by the NATO countries that accepted our geopolitical surrender.
And the world is still reeling from the events of the late 1980's and early 1990's.
The price of a product sold in a high-volume supermarket may not correspond directly to its quality.
It's Monday, and we've got some meat at the supermarket that costs 189 CZK a kilo.
I'll buy it by putting it in the fridge and making it for dinner on Thursday.
In an alternate reality, where I don't buy the meat on Monday, the chain sells it on Tuesday for 99 cents a pound, can you describe the mechanism by which that meat, by changing its price, becomes a burden on my digestive system?
Or do I wait until Thursday and the meat will be discounted one day before the sell-by date to $4.00/kg - how would this be different from the meat I bought on Monday for $5.00/kg and left in my fridge for 3 days?
I'll answer for myself - nothing.
All this bullshit about if something's cheap, it's guaranteed to be bad, spoiled or low-quality is terribly retarded, to tell you the truth.
The other day I went to Brna na Hlavas and the girls were handing out some pamphlets, I always take such things to help the brigadiers, they can't throw it away...
Well, the pamphlet was full of common sense and conservative views on how the world works, but nothing about God, so I was confused, but I knew it was going to be some kind of agitation.
After I read it, I found out who published it, and it turned out to be Scientology.
Well, like it was good stuff, full of totally unnecessary tips, like I'm supposed to wash and not be a pussy.
It's a waste of paper. We shouldn't be cutting down the forests for this.
I had a similar experience with an ex-girlfriend.
Psychological manipulation and emotional blackmail will force you to comply with that person because you love them without realizing how fucked up the situation is.
She threatened to hurt herself a few times because I went out with a friend she didn't like to go out and talk to.
Or when I wanted to leave her apartment early, she started crying and begged me on her knees not to go.
Then she started physically blocking the door.
For a year, it was a great relationship, but then another six months went by, and she started to get her ass kicked.
Then I ended the relationship by telling her that I was breaking up with her and telling her that we could talk about it again next week to calm her down so that she wouldn't go crazy again.
That kind of person sucks the feelings, the emotions, the joy out of you.
It's better to keep your distance.
When the insurance companies are frantically sneaking in, buying up a cloud of tests and chasing down positives who wouldn't even know about this terrible disease if it weren't for the test.
All we're accomplishing is complicating things for companies, carriers and others, because their employees in the random number generator have been grounded for five days.
In the West, they've given up on this charade and admitted there's no point in dealing with a disease weaker than the famous flu.
Unfortunately, Jack's new, and he's got some stealing to do, and he's got his ego fueled by making up bullshit.
Looks like we've got a good old-fashioned piece of crap coming back.
After years of suppressing and repressing this unfair business, MLM recruiting is back in the spotlight.
I was one of the recruits, I tried it (I was 20 years old, freshman in college), the initial promises of product training and business skills quickly turned into "you don't have to care, just get people".
I was genuinely interested in the products I was offering because I wanted to help people, but the training was more about how to scare people and talk to them.
When the first money came in, people quickly realized that if they wanted to make money, they had to sell a few products a month.
Mutual life insurance and mortgages were the only profits, which made you feel like a house pot dealer.
But what can I say, it was a valuable experience, one learned not to jump on every speck and check the information thoroughly.
At the same time, I wouldn't put them all in the same bag.
There are people in this business who are successful and even helpful to people, but they certainly do not boast of expensive consumer goods or "fat" accounts.
In the corporate world where I work, I haven't seen much of this.
HR is cool, managers are minding their own business, and they don't stick their noses in our business.
So the regular evaluation kind of happens, in the form that it happens with us it's quite good (set some goals for next year, next year we'll see what worked and what didn't) - it's more of a self-evaluation than someone evaluating you by some numbers, and so on.
Corporate events are also optional.
But we're also a bit unique within our company - there are departments that are more "corporate".
Sometimes it feels like we're some sort of quasi-startup squatting in the offices of a big corporation.
But it works so they don't bother us much as long as the results are in.
Missing Czech woman in Britain is dead.
Her body was found in London.
For nearly ten days, British police have searched in vain for a missing 32-year-old Czech woman who went missing in late November.
On Sunday, December 12, resigning Foreign Minister Jakub Kulhánek announced on social media that a woman from Uherskohradiště had been found dead.
British police confirmed to our representative office in London this afternoon that they have unfortunately found the body of a missing Czech citizen.
Cause of death is under investigation.
Due to the family's concerns, we will not be releasing any further information on the case.
"My deepest condolences", Kulhánek wrote on his Twitter account.
The young woman was last seen on November 28 on a bus on her way home from work to pick up money from an ATM before boarding.
Her work colleagues reported her missing five days later.
Subsequently, the London police began a search for her, Interpol listed her as a missing person around the world.
That's how she ended up in the Czech Missing Persons database.
The police arrested a man in connection with this a few days ago.
What role he played in the case and what he's suspected of, but she didn't say.
In four municipalities, new councils were created at the end of the year.
On Saturday, December 11, new elections were held in the municipalities of Komňa in Hungary, Lužice in the Czech Republic, Nová Ves in Liberec and Rovná in the Czech Republic.
The number of councillors in these municipalities has fallen below the number laid down by law or the elected councils have been dissolved.
Twenty-eight seats were contested by 99 valid candidates in the new elections.
Voter turnout was 62.41%.
The highest interest was recorded in the municipality of Rovna, where 93.62% of eligible voters voted.
A total of 8 women and 20 men won the mandate.
The average age of elected representatives is 46.7 years.
The oldest is 69 years old, the youngest 33.
A total of 13 candidate lists were registered for the new elections in the four municipalities.
36 women and 63 men applied for 28 representative posts.
The average age of the candidates was 46.6 years.
The youngest candidate was 22 years old, the oldest 72.
The processing of the results of Saturday's elections symbolically closes a rather difficult but successful year for us.
It saw four new or repeated elections to municipal councils and, above all, the closely watched elections to the Chamber of Deputies.
We had to work mostly in more demanding epidemic conditions, which placed greater demands on equipment and personnel security, evaluated Eva Krumpová, 1st Vice-President of the Czech Statistical Office.
The last precinct was processed on Sunday, December 12th at 3:49 a.m.
On Monday, the results of the vote will be discussed by the State Election Commission and, once approved, will be published in the Collection of Laws.
This is the biggest problem I've had with the whole pandemic.
It took me a while at the very beginning to come to terms with the fact that we had a pretty dangerous contagious disease, but it went without a hitch.
Dealing with the idiotic attitude of a large part of the population at all levels of society, that's been a problem for me until now.
What I'm looking forward to the most is getting vaccinated because it's going to make me less dependent on other people not being assholes.
He would be stripped of the presidency and the ability to reassume it.
The chances of that actually happening, as others have mentioned, are very slim.
Besides, I'm not sure that a doctored file would even qualify as treason.
Treason is an act by which the President of the Republic threatens the sovereignty, territorial integrity, or democratic character of the State.
It had to be something more serious.
How the pandemic has affected intimate life: A growing number of people under 35 who have not had sex all year
More and more young adults in the U.S. are living their lives without sex.
These are mainly religious people, according to the DailyMail website.
The survey showed that from 2008 to 2021, the percentage of people under 35 who abstain from sex increased from 8 percent to 21 percent.
The number of women between the ages of 18 and 35 who said they had not had sexual intercourse in the past year is higher than ever.
Other factors contribute to the decline in the number of sexually active individuals, according to a survey by the Institute for Family Studies (IFS).
One of these may be the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic and the higher unemployment rate.
But the presence of media, social networks, and video games that make sex less and less of a priority for young people may also have contributed.
Since 2010, the proportion of men and women between the ages of 18 and 35 who report not having had sex in the previous year has been rising rapidly,said IFS researcher Lyman Stone.
Married people are more likely to engage in sexual activity, with only 5% reporting in 2021 that they had not had sex in the past year.
Among single people, it was 29 percent. Stone added that marriage under the age of 35 is only a small percentage.
Fear of premarital sex and religious affiliation also contribute to the decline in sexual activity.
Although husbands are more likely to be sexually active, the percentage of married men under 35 is still declining.
Young people's view of premarital sex is divided, with about 30% saying it's wrong, while about 70% think it's okay.
"It's true that among single individuals in this age group, they're a minority, but their behavior shifts the trend", Stone says of that 30 percent.
For most of those who have a moral problem with premarital sex, the reason is religious affiliation.
Since 2008, the rate of abstinence among single people under 35 who attend religious meetings more than once a month has increased from 20 percent to nearly 60 percent.
Among the 'less religious' the trend has risen from 10% to 20%", said Stone.
Other factors have also contributed to the decline in sexual activity, such as less social interaction and mainly social drinking during the pandemic.
The study also showed that unemployed people and people with lower incomes are less likely to have sex.
Another reason may be the proliferation of digital media, which seems to reduce the need for sex.
People are spending more time online, thus'replacing' this need.
This trend mainly took hold during the lockdown during the coronavirus pandemic.
This whole COVID vaccine mandate is about whether society should be forcing a portion of the population to engage in behavior that they don't want, but that could save their lives.
It's a rather difficult question, and what I'm most interested in personally is the question of social conscience.
I mean, for example, the question of whether if we don't order them to do it and they die, then it's our fault.
My argument is that we could definitely be responsible for the death of an 80-year-old man who didn't really know much, we didn't explain it to him well, he heard some misinformation, and as a result, he didn't get vaccinated and eventually caught it and died.
On the other hand, I don't think we're to blame for the death of a staunch anti-vaccinationist who, alongside the SPD and the KSČ, has been shouting about bullying and a totalitarian state.
From the statistics I've mentioned, it's pretty clear that most of the unvaccinated retirees are probably in the second group, so they're really going to be on their own.
The Czech Republic without snow.
How does a mild winter help to combat the drought?
This winter so far in the Czech Republic has brought one of the smallest snowfalls in recent times.
Operators of ski resorts can not do without technical snow, the weather complicates even the preparation of the cross-country skiing Jizera fifty.
Is this a trend or an exception?
And what will the lack of snow mean for the fight against drought in the Czech Republic?
I've got a story, but it's not about breadwinners.
One time in high school, our teacher took us all over town to the boatyard so we could take a boat ride down the river.
On our way there, we walked down a fairly wide street, and we couldn't see anyone in the middle - followers of the Hare Krishna sect.
Of course they came at us.
Fortunately, I escaped, but a friend and I got into an argument.
After she left, we asked her and her teacher what she had told them.
"They asked me if I wanted to save my soul.
I told them I don't have a soul", she replied.
Everyone, including the teacher, laughed all the way to the shipyard.
We are so spoiled.
Not much is happening, but the system is already collapsing, says Orozovic
The new German Chancellor, Olaf Scholz, after previous visits to Paris and Brussels, arrived in Warsaw on Sunday, where he was greeted with military honors by Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki.
'We are opening a new chapter in our relations,' Morawiecki said at a joint press conference after the meeting.
Scholz stressed that Europe must show together that it will not accept the violation of Ukraine's territorial integrity.
According to the Chancellor, the crisis caused by the disturbing movements of Russian troops near the Ukrainian border should be resolved through diplomatic negotiations, including within the "Normandy Group", bringing together France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine.
Morawiecki said that he informed the chancellor about the situation on the Polish border with Belarus, whose leader Alexander Lukashenko has artificially created a migration crisis and uses people as live targets and weapons, because every night we record a hundred attempts to (illegal) cross the border.
He's been negotiating with the Chancellor about further sanctions so that the Lukashenka regime and its patrons in the Kremlin will finally understand that we are determined to defend the EU's eastern border.
According to DPA, Scholz assured that Warsaw enjoys German support in the dispute with Belarus, and condemned the inhumane treatment of refugees by the Lukashenka regime.
A drunk Polish nun caused the accident, tried to cover it up.
After a while, the car returned to the scene of the accident, but it was driven by another nun, who tried to take the blame.
When the police told her that she could still lose her driver's license for failing to give priority and fleeing the scene of an accident, she came out with the truth, TVN24 reported.
She admitted that another nun ran into the vehicle and asked for her help.
Then the police came for Sister Celestine.
A breath test was administered, and her blood count was found to be over two milligrams, and her driver's license was immediately revoked.
At the same time, she was told that she would confess her actions in court.
Hugo's dog is doing the best he can.
But Yura Shaimovich didn't take care of his film.
Czech creators of family comedies looked at American stories about pet dogs.
But in doing so, they forgot one essential thing: the legitimacy of the film industry.
After F. Brabce's hilarious film Gump - the dog who taught people how to live, another film is now in theaters for the audience's emotions.
Co-writer and director Juraj Šajmovič Jr. loosely follows his previous film Here I Watch from 2012.
Hugo the talking badger returns to the stage with some of the familiar characters around him.
Julie and Ivan, the owners of a pension in Šumava, which is dying, so they invite the dog owners, Julia's father and his partner and especially her daughter Veronika.
She is no longer a little girl but a teenage girl experiencing her first love.
The director and his partner Beatriz Šajmovičová (who is also the producer of the film) struggled with the storytelling procedures in the previous dog film, but at least the children and the dog were entertained there.
This time, the creative duo wrote an even weaker script that evokes a mixture of awe and feelings of embarrassment.
Let's summarize this.
Julia, although a scientist, succumbs to obscure illusions in her desire for a child, and if the right "constellation" comes, copulates with her forest engineer Ivan, wherever the coordinates just determine  on the hood of a car or a church tower (of course during an ongoing excursion with a local guide), the retired colonel Moim, despite years of training, shoots his daughter (Julii) in his own forest, who falls into a coma, after which the family takes her to the hospital so that a miraculous healing process can take place in the heart of the forest loneliness.
Nothing against the cleansing power of nature and the power of animal lovers.
Their owners know why they have them.
But the viewer is amazed at the jumble of content filled with unrealistic situations and characters that was required for this message.
A pair of staff thieves, a dogfight, a shady charlatan, cops arriving for a "drug search" and discussing herbs for the fertilizing power of bone meal, which, of course, the baked family at the boarding house gets drunk on.
When the heroine wakes up from a deep coma and suddenly sits at the family table with her cigar and makeup on, demanding her father's whiskey and flakes as a recovered vegetarian, it's impossible not to laugh.
On top of that, the creators explain to the viewer that this is what sometimes happens after a coma.
Šajmovič's team lacks the basic dramaturgical knowledge of working with the text, the ability to expose the supporting situations, the sense for the characters and the point and the direction.
The acting is off-balance, the editing is hopeless, and the overall impression is muddled.
As much as Lukáš Vaculík, Jitka Ježková or Nela Boudová try to keep their party going, they don't have much to play for.
The only treasure of the film remains the poetic footage of the nature of Šumava by cameraman Vladimír Holomek and a pair of badgers.
It's not enough to sketch out a few characters, a shoddy plot and a dog's vocabulary, let alone the more vulgar human expressions the characters indulge in.
Nor is the argument based on years of membership in the Badger Breeders' Club - as in the case of Mrs. Producer.
Behind the good intentions of promoting nature and man's friendship with the dog, there must be a mastery of craftsmanship if one is to tell a believable story.
That didn't work in this case.
For a good family film, there's a little too much eroticism and a minimal sense of genre.
Even as an advertisement for canister therapy, this amateurish little stunt wouldn't pass.
Yes, respect, because they have to listen to constant name-calling from jerks like you.
There's a difference between offering and forcing, here's how you know shit, but that's only because you've never tried it.
It's always the customer's decision, if they don't want it, the answer's always no.
If you listened to kids like that all the time, maybe you'd change your mind.
It's a job like any other, in this case a for-profit brigade.
The Middle East has been plagued by unusually dry months.
Winter is the only time of the year when it rains.
"The almost complete absence of rainfall during November, as we recorded at some stations, is unusual", confirms the Israel Meteorological Service.
For example, the village of Kfar Giladi in northern Israel reports only six percent of its long-term average rainfall in November.
The two days of rain this week were therefore rather exceptional.
It's good for us.
It hasn't rained here in a long time.
It's also the right Christmas backdrop, rejoiced the citizen of Nazareth Wasim Ashkar.
Rainfall in Israel occurs almost exclusively in the winter months, and is sudden and irregular.
Forests depend on winter rains.
Without them, they dry up and are prone to fires.
It's not just forests, it's drinking water and irrigation for farmers.
Israel's largest freshwater source, the Sea of Galilee, filled to the brim this spring thanks to the last three rainy winters.
It's been dropping ever since.
Water managers have been warning about the drought for a long time.
It can be expected that depending on global warming and climate change there may be less rainfall, predicted in 2018 the spokesman of the Israeli Water Authority Uri Schor.
Israel can help with technologies like desalination or wastewater recycling.
Worse are the economically weak countries like Lebanon, Syria and Jordan.
The streets of Jordan's capital, Amman, are flooded with tanker trucks.
Water mains and private wells are drying up.
"This year my orders have gone up by 70 to 80 percent compared to the previous two years", tanker driver Imad Suleiman reported in September.
In Isfahan, Iran, clashes broke out between farmers and security forces.
The reason for the protests was the drought.
The local riverbed was completely dry.
The region is experiencing the driest November in many years.
Israel is preparing a military strike against Iran.
The Israeli defense minister said that the talks in Vienna had made no progress and that he had informed Washington of preparations for an attack on Iran's nuclear facilities.
Foreign Minister Benny Gantz said Saturday that he had ordered the Israeli military to prepare for the possibility of a military strike against Iran, according to Jonathan Lis.
Gantz, who resides in the U.S., is trying to convince the Americans to step up their pressure on Iran, but he's also been briefing Washington on military preparations.
During a press conference in Florida, Gantz said that the nuclear talks in Vienna had made no progress and that the world powers understood that the Iranians were playing games with them.
About three years ago, this happened to me, too.
The lady liked me a little bit, and I grilled the interview to see what she wanted me to do.
In the end, I found that my suspicions about the pyramid were justified.
Since I really don't like these shenanigans, I bombarded the young lady with doubts and questions for a while and finally thanked her and left.
You can call me a crook, but a pyramid is a pyramid, and financial advisors are financial advisors.
The skiers headed out into the mountains for the weekend, with plenty of snow and nice weather to look forward to.
Mountain resorts in the Czech Republic experienced their first major influx of skiers this weekend.
After a heavy snowfall at the end of the working week, snow is not an emergency, and some ski resorts have started operating as a result.
Neither did the requirement to have a Covid certificate for the tractor deter the offender.
While skiers have not complained about the lack of interest from customers, some ski equipment rental companies are reporting lower demand for their services than before the epidemic.
Thousands of people in the Liberec region took to the running tracks and downhill slopes over the weekend.
The skiers were greeted by sunny weather and excellent snow conditions.
We are satisfied, the opening weekend has really come out since the Friday evening skiing, when we had the first skier on the hill,praised the interest of the Director of the Sports Complex Ještěd Jakub Hanuš.
Hundreds of people headed for the first skiing weekend of the new season in Autumn, too.
For example, the Ski Aréna Karlov or the center in Branné na Šumpersku were opened.
The weekend attendance was very decent, with an estimated 400 people attending on Saturday and today.
Conditions are excellent.
The sun was shining today, it was about minus three degrees, so perfect, did not spare the praise of the representative of the ski resort in Brno Rostislav Procházka.
Ski resort operators can only sell ski passes to people who are vaccinated or who are past the COVID-19 deadline.
With a few exceptions, people are prepared and show the necessary documents, said ČTK René Hroneš from the ski center Špindlerův Mlýn.
"We only recorded one incident", he added.
Lower than pre-pandemic interest is reported by some ski equipment rental and retailers.
Interest in borrowing skis is fortunate.
It's not like in previous years, but there are still enough customers, said Alexandra Bokišová from the Skiopava store in Opava.
He expects more effort during the ski season.
Also, the CEO of the King's Garden company Snowbear, David Šinták, feels that due to COVID, there is not as much interest in renting ski equipment as before.
By this time before the pandemic, we were almost on borrowed time.
Compared to the pre-pandemic period, we are at about 50 percent, said ČTK Šinták.
According to him, people got lazy with the pandemic and learned to sit at home.
On the other hand, there's a big demand for rentals at the Novako campus in Božji Dar.
Ski rentals started a week ago, and skiers have to book in advance.
"We're starting to rent the races this weekend, but people have already called ahead, so we're expecting a lot of interest, just like last year", said Pavlina Nováková, the venue's operator.
The interest, comparable to the pre-epidemic period, is also in the ski school, according to her.
If we don't want the successful and wealthy to go abroad, they need to be able to live a quality life here like they do abroad.
Certainly not socialist health care, where it is often impossible to find a dentist or a medical specialist.
Smart, resourceful people go abroad who don't have any property here.
The owner of the company doesn't just go abroad.
I totally agree with the rest of it.
If these people do not live well in the Czech Republic and if these people do not have a vision of a reasonable future in the Czech Republic, then they simply will not live in the Czech Republic.
The emigration from Hungary started with Orbán winning one day, ruling for a year, and suddenly the annual emigration increased by a few tens of thousands.
It is naive to think that the Czech Republic cannot find itself in a similar position overnight.
The next issue is elections.
If it's a bad place to live, some old-fashioned V4 freak could win it, too.
The young and the educated will leave, leaving behind his supporters and the people whose possessions can't fit on the plane.
That's a scary picture!
Langmajer in blood because of a beer bet?
While autumn was in full swing in the Czech Republic, in Thailand the crew of the film The Island, led by Jiří Langmajer (55), was enjoying the tropical weather!
The actor posted a bloodied photo of his face on social media.
Is it a real injury, or is it makeup for the shoot?
London police are still searching for the missing Czech woman.
She was last seen on her way home.
"Petra's disappearance bears no resemblance to her behaviour and we are beginning to be very concerned about her", said Lucy O'Connor of the Lambeth Police Department, where Srncova worked, in a video on Saturday.
"Her family in the Czech Republic are also very worried about her and simply want to know where she is", she continued.
Missing Czech reportedly left work around 7:45 p.m. on Sunday, November 28 and headed home to the Camberwell neighborhood.
She was last reportedly seen on a bus about half an hour later.
She was reported missing on December 3rd by one of her co-workers.
According to the British media, Srncová worked as a nurse's assistant at Evelina London Children's Hospital, which belongs to the Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital Association.
"We are extremely concerned about our dear colleague Petra, who is missing", a group of medical facilities tweeted.
"We would encourage anyone who may have any information that could help find her to contact the police", the statement continued.
Member of Parliament Harriet Harman has called for the public's co-operation, having raised the issue of Srncova's case at a press conference on Saturday.
'She's been missing for several days, she's only 32 years old, she's from the Czech Republic, her parents are understandably worried to death,' said the Labour politician, holding up a photograph of the woman distributed by the London police.
"I feel we all have a particularly big responsibility to try and find her because she was out of her home country, away from her family, and working here for our health care", Harman said.
Police have previously arrested a man in connection with the case, who remains in custody.
However, according to the BBC news website, the police have not provided any information about his identity or what he is suspected of.
Russia is incapable of occupying Ukraine, and certainly not with 30 BTGs (i.e. about 5 divisions).
I don't underestimate Ukraine like that either.
It's not a "huge number", it's about 8% of the Russian army.
Notice that Ukraine keeps saying that we're exaggerating the threat of invasion, and they're getting fed up with us coming in.
I was quoting above.
I don't know what makes you think Russia wants a war.
War is a hell of a lot of fun, and Russia has Italy's GDP.
Comparisons to the situation in '38 are off in so many ways, I don't even know where to start.
I can already compare this to the First Punic War and the "annexation" of Sicily:D
I can imagine that after Ukraine announced that it was not going to abide by the Minsk agreements, Russia is annexing those ridiculous republics.
That's all there is to it, and that's what the "concentration" at the border would correspond to.
I mean, the pacta sunt servanda...
In Prague, the new timetables apply from Sunday, mainly affecting suburban connections.
Passengers in Prague's integrated transport (PID) are expecting several changes from Sunday, which mainly concern suburban connections.
New routes have been created, some have changed their routes, and others, on the contrary, have disappeared.
Mladoboslavska is a new member of the integrated system.
In the capital, express trains from České Budějovice stop at the Garden City station from Sunday.
Suburban trains are operated by the S7 trains, which run from Beroun to Český Brod via Prague Central Station.
The new R17 express train from České Budějovice and Benešov will stop at the recently opened Prague-Zahradní Město station.
PID will expand into new areas.
There are also buses to Světlá nad Sázavou, Blatna u Jesenice, Staré Splavy and Turnov.
Buses to Mladenoslavsk will be included, including lines extending to the Liberecký and Královéhradecký Regions.
The integration will result in the cancellation of 77 lines, the introduction of 37 new lines and the modification of 12 existing lines.
From Zličín in Prague there is a new bus line 405 that goes all the way to Žatac.
There is also a new direct connection between Prague and Kralovice near Rakovník, replacing the cancelled train line S53.
They will be reinforced in the morning rush hour and will connect from Prague to Rakovník at the weekend, when the new express line number 404 will leave.
Lines 400 and 410 to the Liberec Region are newly included in the PID system.
They leave from the Střížkov metro station, not from the Holešovice station.
The main line 400 runs through Mělník, Dubá and Česká Lípa to Nový Bor and selected connections continue to Rumburka or Cvikova.
The additional line 410 runs through Mělník and Dubá to Doks, Mimona and Jablonné in Podještědí.
On the contrary, the operation of dozens of Central Bohemian local lines, including Mochov, Dobříš or Rožmital pod Třemšín, has been cancelled or restricted.
All trains leaving Prague at 2:30 have been cancelled.
Due to the modernization of the railway, long-term restrictions continue on the lines Praha  Beroun, Praha  Lysá nad Labem and in the vicinity of Kolín.
Changes await passengers in other places as well.
Buses replace some cancelled railway lines or a section is extended on line 420 from Dobříš with a connection from Prague, where it is possible to use PID tickets up to Milevsk.
The routes of lines 540 to 543 to Nymburk have changed, and the routes of some buses on the border between Central Čech and Hořovicka in the Plzeň Region have been modified.
Healthy office snack/lunch from the supermarket
Hi, I'm working a classic 9-to-5 with a 30-minute break, and my only way to get food is to go next door to Billy's or down the street to Lidl's.
Since I don't have any exercise, I don't have the strength to exercise after work, so I have to eat as healthy and diet as possible.
Unfortunately, I never know what to buy, and in a hurry, I buy a pizza bagel and a yogurt and apple for a snack.
Question: What healthy, non-heat-treated food would you recommend I buy at the supermarket?
Not everyone waits for a foot of snow like you do, unfortunately.
And it's not the trees that you have to see.
Only the tip of the tree can hide under the snow.
If damaged, the tree may be more susceptible to fungal diseases.
I'm not saying that's the only reason we're not allowed to go off-ramp, but it's one of them.
Dara's confession about her relationship with Nedved: I wasn't looking forward to this at all
Since Friday, the Czech show business mogul has been living for nothing but exposing the relationship between Dara Rollins and Pavel Nedved.
They've been going at it since the summer, the famous footballer even got divorced because of the singer.
Dara has now sent a lengthy message to her fans explaining why she kept her love a secret from them for six months.
"I dare say that there is currently no one in the Czech Republic or Slovakia who has not noticed that Dara has caught a bear, sorry, Nedved", jokes Dara Rolins, who is head over heels in love with the most successful Czech footballer.
She said he was the one who had the affair, not the other way around.
Three days in the spotlight, and although they're used to the public's attention, they don't enjoy it.
And there it is.
Something neither of us were looking forward to, but we knew it would happen one day, the singer continues.
I just don't know who's worse off.
Whether it's the ones who don't care at all and it comes out of the can on them, or us, whose lives are being dissected in minute detail.
It's as if one of you wanted to hear your opinion on whether you and your spouse or girlfriend were a good match, or you insisted that everyone know the details of your ex-partners and be familiar with your list of faults and mistakes.
That's what you want, that's what you want, that's what you want, that's what you want, that's what you want, that's what you want, that's what you want, that's what you want, that's what you want, that's what you want, that's what you want, that's what you want, that's what you want, that's what you want, that's what you want, that's what you want, that's what you want, that's what you want.
The pair got together in Italy, where Rolins was traveling to prepare for her new fashion collection.
The black bear has long been the vice-president of the Juventus football club.
They only came out with the truth now because they were waiting for Nedved's divorce to be finalized.
He and his wife, Ivana, have been separated for three years, but not legally married for three weeks.
Anyway, to those of you who are rejoicing with us and wishing us well, thank you.
We're only human, too. We have families, children, pasts and dreams.
We're not perfect, but I think we both have our hearts in the right place.
That's why I love my new husband, and just as he stands by me, so do I stand by him, for better or for worse", Rolins concluded.
Hey, the other commenters have probably said all the right things, but I'm just confirming that the dorms are great to start with, my classmates mostly meet and make friends during the first semester or two and then find suites together, which seems like the best option to me, because you know who you're going to be living with.
Apartments don't usually advertise very far in advance, so you probably won't find much right now, but it certainly doesn't hurt to look at the listings.
Otherwise, be sure to avoid not only Cejl, but also the surroundings (streets like Vranovská, Francouzská etc., that's quite a bad address), even some parts of Židenic are a bit ghetto.
On the other hand, Veveří district is very student, King's field and in that direction it's fine, besides it's close to most faculties VUT (I don't know where exactly you get in).
I mean, I've never looked for rent, but I'm a native Brno, so I can consult with Brno as such if you need any more information.
That's an example of perfectly "normal" thinking.
Because of what a few doctors decided to do somewhere in Poland, it's actually quite okay that the state doesn't adequately fund some schools.
Either let them learn what they want and pay for it on their own, or let them drive on the state's highway and pay for it on the state's highway.
After all, we can't let a private actor control a piece of education just because he adds a few crowns to the full state contribution and therefore he can learn whatever he wants in schools.
Such a statement loses some weight when it is written by a person who two days earlier said this about a petition for a boycott of the totalitarian state:
So voting against having an abortion is the same as voting against having a statue in the square?
If I were you, I'd consult directly with the man who gave you the job.
Otherwise, I've already experienced in cataloguing/digitizing that (even long-time professionals) either throw it away or write something like xxx *** or... (by convention) and in the note that it is unreadable.
The truth is, in this case, it's quite readable, so I don't think I'd recommend it at all.
Personally, I'd probably deal with it in some kind of note depending on what program you're using.
If you want to be a proper and diligent student, you can look in some character databases and find the closest one.
But since it looks like you're drawing from a book, my guess is that the author or the printer simply created their own mark that matches what's physically on the coin.
P.S. Isn't this more like the Odrysian Empire than the Odrynian Empire?
P.S. Someone's already broken this place down for you.
Take a look at that comment with ΦΙΛH
Politicians have no idea what the "theme" of our presidency will be.
That's a lot worse trouble than having interpreters with them.
The idea that they would approve something because no one understood a text is laughable.
All important approved documents are scrutinized word for word, and even a basic knowledge of English is not enough, it's a matter for lawyers.
There are hundreds of translators and interpreters working in the various EU institutions, and English is more suited to politicians for informal contacts, establishing super-standard relationships.
Besides, it's quite interesting with the English, after the UK's withdrawal from the EU.
I don't understand the hatred for Cejl.
I've been working there for three years and I'm fine.
How many times do I leave work at 10 p.m. and never have a problem?
That it's a ghetto can only be said by someone who's barely set foot in it in his life.
Yeah, most of Brno's Roma population probably lives there, but all they do is block the sidewalk and park where they don't belong.:D It's definitely not that I'd be afraid to go out on the street there at night.
So if you're looking for relatively inexpensive housing with good access to downtown, I'd go for it.
A lot of the apartments are newly renovated or newly built.
Felix Slováček (78) without Dada and his mistress Gelem as a stake in the fence!
Who's he spending Christmas with?
On Sunday, most people at the Advent wreath lit their first candle, but not Felix Slováček.
I don't have an Advent wreath, so there was nothing to light.
"I've seen a lot of wreaths, and I'm sure Lucie has some too", said the saxophonist to Blitz, confirming Patras' words that he visits her often.
She's visiting, but not staying at their house in Vinohrady, where Dada was left alone after he left.
Wordy still doesn't know where he'll be on Christmas Eve.
We recently met with Anička, Felix and both grandchildren.
Felix Slováček and Lucie Gelemová are back together again!
Felix Slováček and Lucie Gelemová, together again!
But we were always talking, so Christmas didn't happen.
I really don't know where I'll be.
I buy gifts all the time, and I'm sure I'll get something for Dad and Lucia, like perfume.
"I'm a gentleman", added Felix, who himself attended a music video christening at the Richman Club.
I'm alone here, but I don't feel alone.
I always find someone with whom I like to have fun, says Slovák, who was happy to have met the wife of Luďek Soboty, Adriana, or the singer Kamila Nývltová.
And he made that very clear.
And we're Iceland so we can afford not to have soldiers and guns?
I doubt anyone will defend us for us, and our location is so strategic that an aggressor would have to be a complete idiot not to occupy this territory.
And I don't see why that would be a bad argument, so explain that to me.
I don't know of any other files that could be deployed to hospitals in a crisis.
There's a shortage of police officers who can't afford it, there's a shortage of firefighters who can't afford it, and there's nowhere else that has such a high percentage of medically trained people at this level.
And the fact that our military is only capable of defending the Isle is a slap in the face to previous governments, not the military, which has been begging for new toys for a long time.
Record drought in the Czech Republic.
Agricultural subsidies need to be changed, the country should not be just a food factory, says journalist.
The Czech Republic is experiencing its worst drought in years.
According to scientists, water has been depleted in mountainous and subalpine areas, and smaller amounts of precipitation are being recorded even in places where there has never been a shortage of moisture.
Climate change is causing the drought that is affecting much of central Europe.
But the impact is amplified by the way we manage the land.
How can we prepare for the coming drought?
And how can we help nature in times of trouble?
Yeah, that's right, I can barely keep up with the ice skates, I don't know what hockey is, and the tactics (which I tried in the Hockey Manager franchise) are a total freak.
And whether you're the "Russian Bear" hockey team or the "Chinese Lama" hockey team, losing by two goals when you don't have to win the game at all costs is different than when it's tied.
But anyway, what I hear Czech commentators saying, what the referees notice they don't notice whether it's men's or women's hockey, it's all strange, but it's like that with all sports, UEFA and "Italian actors" or motorsport F1, WRC, etc.
Controversy is everywhere.
And imho if it was the other way around, it's like it's always the other way around, and that the Czech Republic and Russia have lost more often than they've won, I guess it would be the classic "they lost" vs "WE won".
Coronavirus: The number of infections in Russia has exceeded 10 million
On Saturday, December 11, the Czech Republic recorded 9,080 daily cases.
5,766 people are hospitalized.
In total, 34,451 people died in the Czech Republic, another 74.
Confirmed cases in the last 14 days in the Czech Republic is 1967 per 100,000, 871 per 100,000 in the last week.
The number of infections in Russia exceeded 10 million on Sunday.
In the last 24 hours, 29,929 new cases have been reported.
It's the lowest daily count since October 13th.
The total number of registered diseases in Russia is 10 016 896.
The daily death toll is 1,132, the lowest daily death toll since the end of October.
Britain is facing an "inevitable" big wave of infection caused by Omicron, Dr. Susan Hopkins, chief medical adviser for Britain's Health and Safety Executive, said on television on Sunday.
New quarantine measures will be required.
Omicron-infected people are already being hospitalized in Britain, and Hopkins expects the number to rise.
So far, no one has died from omicron, but hospitalizations occur about 14 days after infection and deaths occur about three weeks after infection.
British Labour leader Keir Starmer said on Sunday that Boris Johnson may have broken the law by hosting a Christmas quiz in Downing Street last December, when lockdown was in place and Christmas parties were banned.
A minister in Johnson's government defended that the quiz was conducted "virtually" on a computer.
It was, however, attended in Downing Street by groups of staff gathered around computers.
In Britain, pressure is mounting to remove Johnson as prime minister.
During last December, when a strict lockdown was imposed in London and Christmas parties were banned, Johnson's ministers held numerous parties despite the lockdown.
The British public and media are furious that Johnson and his government have made a mockery of them:
Paul Brand, ITV's commercial editor for Britain: Two years ago today, Boris Johnson won an overwhelming majority in the general election.
This morning, the Conservative Party is talking about removing him as Prime Minister.
It's remarkable how quickly events have unfolded.
You want to turn around and save your own skin?
Hungary faces elections in the spring that could end Viktor Orbán's 12-year rule.
These will be elections of pan-European significance.
How much can you expect them to be fair?
They won't be fair.
They probably won't be free either, because neither were the last two elections under Orbán.
His Fidesz party controls the media, changes the boundaries of the electoral districts to profit from it, and does other tricks smaller and larger.
The last one sounds like everyone can vote wherever they want in practice.
This will allow Fidesz to drive voters from the contested districts to those where the outcome is uncertain and the opposition could win.
So I'll just repeat, they're not gonna be fair at all.
Do you think it's going to be as unfair as it was in 2014 and 2018?
After all, the situation is very different.
It used to be that it wasn't about whether Fidesz would win, but how much and whether it would have a constitutional majority.
Now there is a real chance that more votes and mandates will be won by the united opposition.
This is very unusual for Viktor Orbán and his party.
Won't they try to keep power by playing even harder?
Yes, we have some indications that they're ready to go beyond what they've been doing.
Recently, a recording was leaked to independent media of the speaker of the parliament and one of the leaders of Fidesz, László Kövér, explaining to the heads of the secret services that the opposition is a threat to national security.
These are the signs of the new approach you're talking about?
Yes, that's one of the novelties.
It all starts with the tongue.
I've been beaten quite often, the last time at 14, my mom's parents don't have much patience, I don't either, my dad has for a long time, but then he explodes extremely (only in relation to me).
At the same time, I'm very choleric and I used to get so angry when I was little, to the point where I would lie on the floor in convulsions and I was all blue, and they took me in the shower twice to calm me down.
Sometimes I got a slap on the wrist, sometimes it was more like they didn't know anymore.
I definitely have a tendency now to solve things with violence, as a child I fought quite a bit, now I hit at least something to get out and as a younger I may have slapped my parents over the hand for example (so as not to get too much over the mouth), so never anything extreme, but I always have this urge.
I'm not able to determine to what extent it's my volatility, but I'm sure my upbringing had something to do with it.
I'm afraid I'm gonna lose patience with my kids, too, and deal with it the same way.
I think that beating kids is just wrong and that my parents shouldn't have done it, especially not at a time when it was no longer "educational", but out of frustration, on the other hand, maybe every parent just screws up something, I guess it's impossible not to screw their kids up a little bit, so I don't blame them.
I'm not offended. I don't see why the O.P. should be ashamed of anything.
Laws should be clear and unambiguous.
So I'd call clients those who make laws of that quality.
Otherwise, I was wondering, are you worried about a power outage?
Can you really count on people wanting the product and buying it, and you're going to have a mortgage to pay for it?
The monster world of the coachman.
Where will Slovakia move the trial of the murderers of journalist Kuciak?
In Slovakia, the main trial begins in the trial of the four accused of the murder of Ján Kuciak and Martina Kušnírová.
The death of an investigative reporter and his partner changed Slovakia.
It mobilized civil society, but also exposed the practices of the accused businessman Marián Kočner and his connections to the top of Slovak politics and justice.
How crucial will the trial be for Slovakia?
A lot of this is because of the journalists.
How is it possible that this petition got an order of magnitude more media attention than the anti-petition by the deans of all the medical schools that came out a day or two later?
No, they were fooled, and the company paid for it.
People were dying of Covid on Czech TV six months ago.
Another government ends and the law on the involvement of municipalities in the selection of storage places nowhere
The proposal of Minister Karel Havlíček needs to be fundamentally reworked
The government of Prime Minister Andrej Babiš has come to an end, and the law that was supposed to ensure respect for the interests of municipalities and their citizens in the selection and authorization of deep-sea storage of highly radioactive waste still does not exist.
The government's Legislative Council has suspended consideration of a proposal submitted to the government by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce after years of delays.
However, its content is in serious conflict not only with the affected municipalities associated in the Platform against Deep Deposit, but also with the Union of Cities and Municipalities of the Czech Republic.
The municipalities expect from the law a more significant strengthening of their options in deciding on the repository, which has been promised to the mayors since 2011, when the first work on this legislation began, and which is required by the Czech Atomic Act and the European Directive.
We expect the new government, in accordance with its coalition agreement, to rework the proposal in cooperation with the municipalities.
The proposal from Minister Karel Havlíček, which is available on the Platform, is criticized by municipalities in particular: The proposed level of involvement of municipalities and the public in the decision-making process on the selection of a site for the repository is insufficient and cannot ensure respect for the interests of municipalities and their citizens.
It can only be truly effective if the municipalities or the public can influence whether the process continues at all in the locality.
This can be ensured by requiring the Land Registry to obtain the consent of the municipalities concerned before initiating a specific procedure.
The proposal for a substantive plan omits almost entirely the involvement of the public and makes the citizens of the municipalities practically mere extras in the recruitment procedures.
The proposal lacks a systematic set-up of compensation for municipalities for the whole process of finding and selecting a site for a repository, its authorisation and operation.
Realistically, according to today's legal standards, municipal officials do not have much choice in defending the interests of their citizens in the search for a storage site.
Only in certain authorisation procedures may they submit observations or appeal, but the decision is taken by the Office or the Minister in whose interest the authorisation is to be granted.
Any action shall not have the effect of suspending the execution of exploration or construction works.
The co-decision of local governments, which the Platform calls for, is a principle commonly used in many democratically advanced countries, and certainly in those that have already made progress in authorising repositories, such as Sweden or Finland.
Furthermore, the drafting of the law is another failure of the state administration, which hires external law firms to prepare the legislation.
In the present case, it is a contract with the law firm HAVEL & PARTNERS s.r.o. concluded by SÚRAO and following on from the contracts with lawyer Jan Zemánek.
According to the contract register, the total value of these works is almost CZK 4 million.
Antonín Seknička, deputy mayor of Cejle from the village of Hrádek and spokesman for the Platform against Deep Landfill, said: "After the ministers of industry, who only deferred to their successors the alignment of the position of the municipalities vis-à-vis the state authorities in the search for a deep landfill of highly radioactive waste, we expect a more significant turn from the new government.
We're willing to lend a helping hand.
We also thank the Union of Cities and Municipalities for their support, which sees the issue of the lack of rights of municipalities in such a crucial construction project in the same way as the directly affected municipalities in selected locations.
The anti-deposit platform brings together 51 members (35 municipalities and towns and 16 associations) in order to push for a change in the state's approach to the management of spent nuclear fuel and other radioactive waste, which will not be limited to deep storage.
Furthermore, the Platform advocates that the decision on the selection of a site for possible storage be subject to the prior consent of the municipalities concerned.
Actor John Goodman, 69, lost 200 pounds because of fear.
Although he had not needed to make any changes in his lifestyle for many years, he was eventually intimidated by the doctors.
They told him if he didn't lose weight, he'd die.
And it worked.
Goodman has gradually lost 200 pounds [90 kg], half his original weight of 400 pounds [180 kg], reports The Sun.
He showcased his new character in Los Angeles at the premiere of the animated series The Freak Brothers.
The fat guy from the sitcom Roseanne is a completely different person!
John used to joke that his friends and family begged him to lose weight because his big body made the furniture crack.
"I put everything in my mouth", the actor said in a 2018 interview with AARP.
I wanted to take it slow this time.
Moving around, working out.
"I'm getting to an age where I can't afford to sit still", said ABC's Goodman, whose transformation is amazing.
It also depends on what kind of boss and what you want to use the word "boss" for.
If it's some text on a platform that expects readers from a gaming environment, I wouldn't translate it at all.
If it were a formal text, maybe a college text, I'd be looking for a way to describe or explain bosses.
There's more than one kind of boss for everything.
For example, a game like Dark Souls etc. has several bosses, right, and so the "boss" is something like the lord/ruler of a given level, and then there's the final boss...
In many games, there are hidden bosses (super bosses, hidden bosses) that do not need to be defeated at all to complete the game or level, but are often even stronger than the standard boss.
Then there's games like Half-Life, where there are bosses, but the player doesn't fight them directly (Tentacle, Gargantua), and can they be called bosses at all?
And then there are the mini-bosses.
It's not possible to translate bosse unilaterally, neither Czech nor other languages do it (only Catalan is interesting, which translates bosse as the final opponent).
In short, it's a story- or game-generally significant, computer-controlled, adversary stronger than all the previous ones and guarding the completion of some level or task.
The world is searching for the missing Peter of London.
Even the Czech police got involved.
The British police have been searching for the missing Peter Deer since December 3rd.
Czech police are also involved in the search.
He's been looking for this 32-year-old woman from Hungary since December 7th.
Through Interpol, he's also helping the British police.
Czech Petra Srncova was last seen by her colleagues on November 28th.
British police have been looking for her since December 3rd.
Interpol issued a so-called yellow notice for her.
So the whole world is looking for Peter.
'The Czech police are working closely with the British police,' confirmed police spokeswoman Kateřina Rendlová.
"We share information on the case", she added.
The announced search for Peter has already appeared on the police website.
According to him, she is 5'4" tall, thin, and has brown eyes and long straight hair of the same color.
She's supposed to be from Hungary.
Petra worked as a nurse in a London hospital.
Friends and colleagues are concerned about her, as such disappearances are very unusual for her.
Congresswoman Harriet Harman has joined the search for Peter.
She was involved in putting up flyers with Petra's face on them.
"We are very concerned about her", she said at a press conference on Saturday.
In connection with the disappearance, British police have already detained one suspect.
But it's not clear who he is or what he has to do with Petra.
The Czech Republic on Christmas Eve is terrorized by Agent Tesla.
While October's data showed a slight decline in attack campaigns, last month, as the end of the year approached, attacks increased significantly.
A major campaign involving Agent Tesla was recorded on November 18th.
The attacks are targeted at the Czech Republic.
The attackers' strategy remains the same for now.
An infected attachment in an email is designed to attract the user's attention with a name that refers to payments and financial transactions.
While last month the dangerous attachment had the word "invoice" in its title, this time it was labeled "Copy of bill corrections for 11,2021...exe", said Martin Jirkal of ESET.
Spyware contains features that scan Internet browsers and other programs, such as Microsoft Outlook, Mozilla Thunderbird or Yandex email clients.
The malicious code actively searches for stored login credentials, which it then sends to the attackers.
The last strong campaign took place in the Czech Republic at the turn of August and September, and with the approach of the holidays and the end of the year, the activity of the attackers increases again.
In November, the Formbook spyware also remained active.
Unlike Agent Tesla, the attackers in this case are not specifically targeting the Czech Republic, and security specialists in November detected campaigns with a global reach.
Compared to October's data, Formbook weakened slightly in November, but still accounted for almost a fifth of all detections.
The attacks occurred continuously throughout the month with increased activity on November 3rd, 10th and 15th.
The Formbook most commonly contained an attachment with the.exe extension, entitled REQUEST FOR SPECIFICATION.
However, the name of the receipt still appears.
The Czech annex can then be much more dangerous for the Czech user.
A significant decrease in activity is noted by security analysts at Fareit, which was responsible for 1.6 percent of attacks and has not had a major attack campaign in the Czech Republic in the last few months.
Today's demos of smart guys who don't need oxygen because oxygen is for vaccinated morons.
The march through Prague was bigger than the media is reporting.
Based on the footage of the waterfront parade and my experience as a protester, I'm not afraid of an estimated 10,000 people.
The people in the procession filled the waterfront and the bridge and the opposite waterfront road.
That's a lot of people, really.
The march of some four thousand protesters is spontaneously joined by an unprecedented number of passersby.
I'm saying that something new is being born here, writes Radek Mokrý.
That the persistent discontent of several large groups or strata of the population has led them to find common ground.
Only the anti-vaxers, the anti-Russians and so forth could not fill or pay for such a large parade.
Dead Dog events are on the rise, which reminds me of Million Moments for Democracy.
Sometimes I get the feeling they're renting the same stage and the same equipment.
It's hard to say how much of this dissatisfaction can be bribed. It depends not only on the money supply, but also on whether Pfizer's three-dose vaccine becomes a four-dose, multi-dose vaccine.
It's not going to be a left-wing or a centrist movement, that's for sure.
The three-dose vaccine will almost certainly become a multi-dose vaccine, because it's obvious that we're going to have to revaccinate every six months.
I'm very glad the vaccines saved us.
A brilliant feat of scientific ingenuity, of which humanity is rightly proud.
An end to strife, Bulgaria has a new Prime Minister calling for change
Bulgarian President Rumen Radev has appointed the new government of Kiril Petkov of the anti-corruption movement Continue the Change, which won the November elections.
He's already managed to form a broad coalition government that should take office in a few days.
The political crisis in the country has been ongoing since April, when the previous government lost the elections under the weight of anti-corruption protests.
However, the victorious parties, which had pledged to fight corruption and abuse of power, were unable to reach an agreement, so two more early elections followed.
What do cats do when no one's looking?
The secretly captured footage is a global hit.
Concerns grew in Britain over the weekend over the fate of a 32-year-old Czech woman who has been wanted by London police for several days.
Petra Srncova was last seen two weeks ago driving home from work south of the British capital.
In addition to the police, her current employer, or the MP for the London borough where she lived, is calling for information about the children's hospital worker.
"Petra's disappearance bears no resemblance to her behaviour and we are beginning to be very concerned about her", said Lucy O'Connor of the Lambeth Police Department, where Srncova worked, in a video on Saturday.
"Her family in the Czech Republic are also very worried about her and simply want to know where she is", she continued.
Missing Czech reportedly left work around 7:45 p.m. on Sunday, November 28 and headed home to the Camberwell neighborhood.
She was last reportedly seen on a bus about half an hour later.
She was reported missing on December 3rd by one of her co-workers.
According to the British media, Srncová worked as a nurse's assistant at Evelina London Children's Hospital, which belongs to the Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital Association.
"We are extremely concerned about our dear colleague Petra, who is missing", a group of medical facilities tweeted.
"We would encourage anyone who may have any information that could help find her to contact the police", the statement continued.
Shumper's amateur painter of children's rooms Zdenka Dvořáková Kocourková (and also a county pirate councillor) gave anonymously that her paintings violate copyright.
But the court has ruled that the paintings of the Mole in the Shumper Room do not violate the law.
In the mouth of the Lab, there was a hole in the road for a month in the form of a canal without a cover.
It was a matter of life and death.
The magistrate referred the complaints to the DSR, which owns the road, and because it did not respond, the hole continued to sink.
Finally, the authorities clarified responsibilities and ownership, and after a month, the DSB began to address the situation intensively.
