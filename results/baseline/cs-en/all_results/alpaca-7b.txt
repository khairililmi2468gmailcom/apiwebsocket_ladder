A great return of Czech slalom is approaching.
Pavel Francouz was recruited to the NHL.
The Czech goalkeeper Pavel Francouz, who is going through a difficult period of his career, is returning to the NHL.
A 30-year-old Plzeň native will soon be on the bench and could even score a goal.
The former goalkeeper of Litvinov, Plzen or Russian Chelyabinsk was injured in the preparations for the NHL last fall.
Halfway through the game with Vegas, he was replaced and has yet to appear on an NHL rink since.
It happened in the moment when the experienced goalkeeper shuffled from one post to the other.
Pavel France will be out approximately three to four weeks with an injury to the lower body, announced the team from Denver at the beginning of October.
His return to the NHL ultimately lasted more than two months.
On Saturday morning of American time, he was called from the farm where he had caught four ducks and showed his old form.
He achieved 94.5% of the tasks.
The player from Pilsen finally wants to break through and prove that he belongs in the best league in the world.
In the last year, he had problems with his knees and in the shortened pandemic year, he didn't play a single game.
Francisco "Francis" saved 36 games, with a save percentage of 92.3%.
Charles puts Camille in a Christmas dress, William and Kate are posing in Jordan.
Prince William and his wife Kate chose a family photo taken during their trip to Jordan as their Christmas wish.
Prince Charles also published his wishes, using a photograph of him helping his wife Camille to put on her tiara.
BBC News reported on their website about that.
They are sending wishes to friends, colleagues, and benefactors with whom they are collaborating.
A photograph was taken in a desert landscape.
The Duchess of Cambridge is wearing long summer dresses in khaki color and Princess Charlotte has them as well.
Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, has the same clothes and tie as princes George and Louis.
William and Kate did not take the photograph, it is not clear when exactly it was taken.
The royal family posed for a Christmas photo in front of a barn full of straw in their rural home in Norfolk County.
The picture, which serves as a Christmas wish, was also published by Prince Charles and his wife Camilla.
Photographer Sam Hussein captured the moment in June at the races in Ascot.
Charles, who has a cylinder on his head and a scarf on his face, helps Camille to match her scarf with her light-colored dress.
Slavia Prague offered Berba a million euros to sign for them, but he rejected it.
Prague – Criminal investigators are reportedly involved in the current corruption case, in which the accused former vice-president of the Football Association of the Czech Republic, Roman Berbr, was allegedly promised a million crowns for the league title in the 2018/19 season.
The server efotbal.cz informed him that he had accessed part of the police records.
Jaroslav Tvrdík, the president of the Vršovice club, stated that they have not engaged in any corrupt activities.
The server published transcripts of police recordings, in which Slavia's former sports director Jan Nezmar figures prominently. He was dismissed from the club this summer.
A former influential figure from the red-and-white movement was according to the investigation in frequent contact with both Berba and former sports director Roman Rogoza, who is also among the accused.
Criminalists allegedly worked with the information that Slavia Prague promised a financial reward if they won the title.
Slavia Prague won the league title in 2019.
The police organ had knowledge that Roman (Berbr) was promised a million-euro bonus by the officials of Slavia Prague, as reported by the server.
Later, according to the criminalists, Berbr met Nezmar not only with Tvrdík, but also with the president of the board of directors of Slavia.
There is no further information available from the server, whether the police are still investigating this matter.
He rejected any and all corrupt activities.
In 2015-2017, we actively tried to change the situation in Czech football and offered an alternative development path.
We never engaged in unlawful activities, nor did we try to influence the judges in violation of the rules of fair play, and we did not provide any financial compensation in this regard, as Tvrdík stated to Seznam Zprávy.
Slavia's former coach Tvrdík is disrespected by Nezmar, who also speaks ill of some of his former players.
The police intervened in several matches by influencing the referee in the middle of October, including the FAČR headquarters in Prague.
The highest-ranking person involved in the scandal is Berb, who is no longer involved in any football functions.
In January, former Vyšehrad sports director Rogoz was released from custody.
Drones, tanks, and BVPs are playing a cold war.
The guns will be new, but of a worse type (gunners must load the shells manually from the armored cabin and expose themselves without cover).
English translation: These are new and good.
Backpacks and various armored vehicles - at a reasonable level, moreover, it was possible to get rid of Prague V3S and specialized units.
Letadla: Not very comfortable, but at the end of the rental, good transportation, but with a short range, but modern.
Few types of drones have combat potential.
We don't have any (but we produce and export abroad).
Central - Cold War-era, outdated; short range - good, modern, relatively good number.
I am telling a story.
I'm going to the city.
The river flooded and destroyed the crops, so I was there to help.
When I arrived, I saw that there was a fisherman by the riverbank.
I didn't want to do a bordel, so I just sat quietly and typed away.
I was sure it would go away, but of course a fox came out of nowhere.
I walked 40 meters before I decided to shoot.
The fisherman nearly fell over, he was so startled when I called him, telling him it was a fox on all sides.
When I was at the store, I found the item I was looking for.
I am looking for a job.
There is no war on the other side, it must have taken many coincidences for something to happen, probably you would see it in a thermal vision, which you have almost every day.
You are welcome to come to our visible place, take whatever you need and have a comfortable stay.
Vojtěch versus Hamáček translates to "Vojtěch vs. Hamáček" in English.
Inhalers are significantly cheaper than the Ministry of Health.
The responsible person for the purchase and distribution of face masks and respirators for coronavirus has spent millions of crowns in the past weeks.
The server Rozhlas compared purchases of individual ministries and found that during one day the amounts varied by hundreds of crowns.
Why were prices so volatile?
How did the offices behave economically?
Why did they buy that car?
Lenka Kabrhelová is speaking with server editor Dominika Kubištová.
I love both the army and the veterans of the former Czechoslovakia, but the current Czech Republic cannot benefit from compulsory military service.
We do not have large stores of technology, which could be trained, we do not actually have modern technology for existing professionals, and modern technology is always more complicated, so the skills of reservists will be lost in time.
In modern day conflicts, anyone can be involved, and they will happen very quickly, with no one needing to re-learn anything.
In the end, reserves and territorial defense have great importance for countries such as Ukraine, where it is necessary to lead a mass guerrilla and it is a stated necessity to frighten the enemy.
In the Czech Republic, a conflict of this magnitude and intensity will only be possible if the guerrillas are irrelevant, and we do not have the appropriate geography for it.
We do not have individual skills.
There is nothing worse than that.
The worst thing is that half of them are playing, as if they had it.
He finds himself in such a situation that he is eating a snack, takes two minutes to go back and open the empty gate, then drives either one or two cars and shouts "What are you thinking, that something is going to happen now?"
Of course, they tax the average taxpayer like any other.
It is so terrible that I was shocked when I saw that our attacker was able to take down one of our opponent's players.
The first butterflies.
The Covid-19 pandemic is slowing down, but experts do not expect any major changes in the coming weeks.
Nap time in hospitals according to statistical models may still last for some time and a new, unknown variant, called Omikron, which is likely to spread faster than the currently dominant Delta.
It is not yet possible to say with absolute certainty whether it can cause a more serious course, how vaccination or post-infectious immunity acquired from previous illness can help.
The Covid-19 equations have this week also brought an unexpected phenomenon on the plus side: the possibility of treatment.
A new medication, molnupiravir, which reduces the risk of severe illness and associated hospitalization by one-third, can be taken at home.
He had to fill out a form from the company Pfizer, which reports an 85% success rate from previous results.
The first deliveries of molnupiravir to the Czech Republic, despite the hope of expanding the toolbox in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic, also highlighted the question of how prepared the local administration is for incoming medicines.
It was said that the first patients in the Czech Republic will receive the drug Molnupiravir from the company Merck.
The company ended first because the drug had been developed for a long time in order to find an appropriate treatment for viral diseases of horses in South America.
This research often neglects the fact that people in the West (Germany, Sweden etc.)
They are generally less open and do not share their opinions.
Eastern Europeans, including the Czech people, are accustomed to saying "how the beak has grown".
Conduct research to find out what people think about Muslims.
In English, most people will say that they don't understand.
In the West they will tell you that they enjoy migration, that everyone should help them and that the Czechs are all racist.
He voted for the AfD party.
Saying this publicly means losing your job and media lynching.
The west looks heavy, the east is bad.
He will really find out what people think.
Both Jean-Marie Le Pen and Marine Le Pen, according to polls, have over 20% support.
I know that the objects are three and completely identical.
Because of the rotation of units, soldiers don't have to relearn where everything is, so all objects are identical.
One is the Atomic Museum of Brdy and the other two are abandoned.
He did not want to have nuclear weapons on his own territory, either for safety or for the speed of deployment, due to its western location.
In every oak tree there are two hollows, but not whole rockets as it is said.
If it was necessary to attach this weapon, a special unit arrived to take the barrel and mount it onto some kind of support.
Besides the museum apple tree, there are others in a desolate state.
At the elementary school, we had a classmate named Cigan, and we were together for 4 years.
He was always on the move, did good deeds, often overdid it, but he was our mascot.
Everyone knew him and he often went somewhere to try to explain something, but he was not very successful, he went regularly, he was interested in sports, and he never stole anything, not even phones.
He went to school in nature, did various odd jobs, but was always happy, never getting into trouble.
The siblings, the clowns, entered the same grade, different classes.
They often beat the teacher, solved something there often police, threatened and intimidated other students.
I often sell used items, sometimes things I don't need anymore, and I have sold them to the Gypsies many times. They always had the money, never tried to take advantage of me, and communication was always peaceful.
I gave him that car, and the boy called every month to say he had finally repaid the debt.
I say that I am not racist, as long as someone is white, black, yellow, blue or any other color, as long as they behave in a manner that is acceptable in polite society (work, function, does not beat women, just normal behavior).
When anyone comes, they shake hands, evacuate apartments and houses, there is disorder all around, but it will bother me.
I have no problems with African migrants, as long as they get involved, start working, learn the language (not necessarily English, at least), and respect our culture.
If you believe in Allah, it is one, as long as you respect my traditions and culture, I will also respect yours.
A young woman died in a car accident on Prachatice.
A young woman sustained numerous serious injuries and despite resuscitation efforts, she succumbed to her injuries at the scene, according to Zuzana Fajtlová, a spokesperson for the South Bohemian Health Rescue Service.
The driver probably hit the girl.
The driver of a Peugeot car probably drove in the direction of Bavorov from the village of Žíchovec and then made a U-turn at the fork in the road.
The collision between a Skoda Octavia and a Peugeot resulted in the vehicle ending up on the roof of the highway, as reported by police spokesperson Štěpánk Schwarzová.
The young driver of the Peugeot suffered very serious injuries in the accident.
He sustained numerous injuries and was left bewitched in the car.
Rescue worker Fajtlová stated that the patient had to be provided urgent emergency care and, in a stable condition, was airlifted to the Czechowice hospital.
He was injured in the neck and was taken to the hospital.
Outside the EU, new rules apply, customers often fail to provide the necessary information.
Lukáš Neuheisl is ordering items from abroad as well as multiple times a month.
He mainly collects trading cards.
It is usually possible to find dozens of dollars, let's say from ten dollars up, where it is still worthwhile to import, especially from Japan, where the post is often free.
From October, the cost of small shipments slightly increased, so the sender must now include DPH and provide the necessary customs information.
He will receive an email informing him that customs are expecting the package.
The customer must fill out the delivery details, and if the merchant did not include them during the sale, the customs office will calculate the total cost of the goods and shipping from the total amount.
If the recipient does not arrange for customs clearance themselves, they must also pay the shipping costs.
Lukáš Neuheisel's process is not complicated.
Attach one or two zipper pockets, insert two pages, and I'm done.
For me, it is usually a question of five minutes, says Neuheisel.
All supplies can be delivered smoothly.
Due to new customs regulations, the number of international packages received at the post office in Prague has decreased from 60,000 to 15,000 per day.
In addition to the Czech Post's problem of people not responding to requests for information needed to complete customs clearance, there is also the issue of incomplete or incorrect data being provided.
Currently, there are 30,000 packages at the international post office that need to be processed.
If people filled in all the data that is needed, and if they filled it in on time, we would be roughly halfway there, according to Czech Post spokesperson Matyáš Vitík.
Inflation solution.
How did you propose to address the current inflation?
We are currently experiencing 9.9% inflation and expect it to continue to rise.
You asked me to slow down or compensate for this growth, or did you want me to do both?
We would like to reduce VAT on food and pharmaceuticals, is this the right path for you?
What do you think will happen when it's inevitable that something will happen?
People will not be able to afford basic things, especially energy.
How many employees do you need to add?
This year we added 2% to our income, which is a disappointment, but thankfully I have similar pleasure from my business activities, which I am running as part of my job.
Why are convicted criminals sometimes sentenced to only six months in prison?
That head just won't take no for an answer, it can only be sentenced to six months in prison so that it can do it again as soon as it gets out.
Six months is nothing compared to the fact that its victim will have trauma for several years, which will negatively affect their sexual relationships and overall relationships.
You do not have to remember the victim of rape ever again.
Will this potential disclosure of sexual assault be reported?
The man from Hroby "threw" his girlfriend from Kostomlat.
The man from Hrob helped the guards to apprehend his nationwide wanted girlfriend from Kostomlat, for whom a warrant for arrest had been issued.
He invited her to come.
He went to the store.
He greeted the passerby and made up a story that he had been robbed.
The guards, who had been called to the scene, arrived and were shocked when the allegedly "stolen" person told them that he had fabricated the whole thing in order to lure the guards to the scene.
He only wanted to ask the guards how to report to the Police of the Czech Republic.
When the guards checked the identity of the man and his girlfriend, they discovered that the woman was on a list of wanted people, nationwide search, and a warrant for her arrest had been issued.
The Czech Republic is handling the case.
Is our country considered to be a Slavic country by you?
I believe that Slavs have never been an ethnic or cultural minority, but I'm interested in your opinion.
Jinak s memem souhlasím, škoda že se Churchillovi nepovedlo zajistit osvobození Prahy USA :'(
I do not deny that we have a Slavic language.
I don't know, is it really a question, whether a rational person can believe something completely without evidence just because it might bring success.
I would not have considered that case to be true personally.
There are approximately ten thousand different religions in the world, if you don't count the ones that don't exist anymore.
For whom or which gods does a person choose?
I said it is likely that in one of those thousand religions there is at least one god who will reward you if you believe in another god.
In the tenth commandment it is written, "Thou shalt not have any other gods before me."
In this case, it is more rational to refrain from believing in any god, rather than taking the risk of picking the wrong one and having him send me to hell or some similar place?
Voluntary training with subsequent placement in the reserve.
The Swiss model is similar to.
Training (in various specializations, X months for one month) under the guidance of professionals with practical experience.
If a person leads well, they may receive a professional offer.
To everyone in the Czech Republic, something like this was thrown.
We are collaborating with the University of Defence.
We can talk like this: Collaboration between the educational sector and industry is constantly evolving, with companies recruiting from schools and there is a flow of labor from educational institutions to workplace.
Not only during adolescence, but this process is constantly ongoing, each of us is constantly learning something new, transitioning from one field to another, etc.
Similarly, coordination should also work between the civilian and military sectors.
I perceive it as a path to build some kind of relationship between a citizen and an institution that guarantees that there will never be a Russian, German or Mongolian invasion.
It's funny how you view NATO as something carved in stone, we have allies and you will be defended if it comes to a crisis.
Don't worry, boss.
Only one vote in the USA can turn their budget and NATO into ashes.
The English translation for this sentence is: The English translation for this sentence is: The Anglos exchange us for Russian wealth, the Germans exchange us for Russian gas, and the Poles have already proven that they are willing to show their backs and take whatever they want.
The only thing that has consistently functioned as a guarantor of independence is an armed army and the people who are able to master the military technology of their time.
Any teenager can fly a remotely-controlled aircraft, as long as they try.
We don't need border fortifications anymore, it's today's trend, but a teenager with a long-distance-controlled device will be able to handle it.
How did you survive the tsunami?
Hide some presents under the Christmas tree and suddenly you will be home surrounded by wrapping paper and fillings.
This "odpad" is being reused by e-shops, which lack packaging materials.
A trade map has been created, which your used containers are stuck in.
There are no holidays.
All materials are designed to withstand repeated manipulation.
It is a shame to treat them like one-time waste.
KamSnIM.cz contains almost 150 carton boxes, plastic or paper fillings.
Small businesses will benefit from this initiative, as it will reduce the amount of waste created, as well as avoid overcrowded blue containers.
People are visiting shops in search of products that are currently in short supply and also saving money, since cardboard boxes have recently become more expensive by 50%.
For eco-conscious customers, we also strengthen our brand.
One of such shops is TIERRA VERDE, a producer of eco-friendly cosmetics and toiletries.
Individuals will transport the filled material to Popůvek near Brno, but companies also call us to arrange regular shipments of accumulated cartons.
We use everything when packing items from our e-shop.
Together, individuals and companies create a more considerate world.
Our wish is to preserve nature's sources and beauty for future generations, as stated by Petra Lopušníková from Tierry.
KAMsNIM.cz shows not only pick-up locations for packaging materials.

Everything can end up in the right place, and recyclable items will find their second home.
The project contains over 100,000 such places.
Slowly but surely, collections points, re-use centres, textile banks, charity shops, SWAPs and other places are popping up, which help to find new uses for items that would otherwise be wasted, according to Miroslav Kubásek, one of the authors of the application from the group Ukliďme Česko.
It bothers me that in today's world, technology is so simple and accessible that children who use computers or phones are playing games instead of learning basic computer skills.
Recently, there has been a problem (especially in English articles) that university students have difficulty understanding the principles of computer components.
Because some applications, such as Google Photos or Apple Photos, or even mobile phones in general, simply hide the underlying filesystem and all its contents and put it all on one screen in the application.
Children are taught this technology from an early age, but it is most important that they learn something new.
We will study history, seriously.
Emmanuel Macron presented the priorities of the French presidency of the EU – it begins in January – and it was grandiose.
Macron spoke for an hour, during which he unveiled his presidency's logo, called for protection of Europeans - both in work and on the streets - and mentioned so many initiatives that it will take half a year to implement them all.
French politicians enjoy it and voters enjoy it as well.
Supporters of Macron's centrist government agree on the need for compromise, but differ on how to achieve it, especially in Europe.
In France, there will be new elections for the head of state.
The election calendar influenced even our priorities.
The French leader mentioned that historians should write "one history of Europe" and France is prepared to create the conditions for such a task.
A number of commentators rushed to criticize Macron, accusing him of being pro-European propaganda and rewriting history.
We are trying to protect the history by writing it down.
Right-wing presidential candidate Éric Zemmour is currently touring France with the argument that the Vichy regime, which collaborated with Hitler during World War II, was not as bad as it has been portrayed and is popular with the French people.
Macron's idea to reform the French education system is to be taken seriously and we should not ignore the current events in France.
Do I need to?
Students in European countries usually learn history as a story of "us versus them" instead of as a story of the whole.
Spaniards, Frenchmen, Czechs learn who defeated whom in which battle.
If they do not have a wise conductor, they will not know what the wider context of the event was.
Where are you going, Aida?
The mice did not win.
The story, which returns to the massacre in Srebrenica in 1995, has won awards for direction and best actress Jasna Đuričić.
At the Karlovy Vary Film Festival, he was among the top favorites of the audience.
Anthony Hopkins was the best actor in Berlin for the film Father.
I am not young, I am not healthy/fit, and I am not vaccinated.
I had the flu for a few days and didn't really feel like smoking...
In comparison to the common cold, this was worse.
I don't feel well with a cold.
This is a personal experience. I have not heard that everyone has had the same experience.

Prose texts that follow on from the preceding collection Petříček Sellier & Petříček Bellot.
Another observation of the world and a description of everyday things with a poetic curiosity, depth and atmosphere.
In his second novel, photographer Šesták attempted to capture the essence of a small town and Czech society.
The story of returning to one's roots, which proves to be a desired illusion.
The Bohemist carries a fairy tale about the Red Riding Hood to the stage of a contemporary village.
Its brutality surpasses popular versions and graduates to an emotional emptiness.
It is shorter to go back to one's instincts than to admit defeat.
In his last novel, the author tells a less sentimental story about returning from emigration, something we have grown accustomed to hearing.
Those who remained know too little about those who left to attempt a shared life together.
Buses are beginning to follow the new driving rules, some drivers will change.
Trains start running according to the new timetable on Sundays.
The biggest change is the replacement of train conductors on certain routes, such as between Ústí nad Labem and Kolín, where RegioJet will be taking over from Czech Railways.
Most lines are adjusted according to the time of departure, or their route may be slightly altered.
There will be many new trains on the tracks.
The drivers began to drive during the fall.
Czech Railways plan to operate 6783 daily passenger trains, of which 478 will be long-distance trains.
During the new driving order, approximately 118 million kilometers were traveled.
The new timetable will also include domestic connections within the EU, such as to Germany, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Austria and Switzerland.
The company is introducing dozens of new trains.
The new InterJet trains will be running on the routes from Prague to Cheb.
New trains will be running in Northern Moravia or in Western Bohemia.
Fares will increase by 3.2% on average next year.
Prices inflate their tariffs annually.
The biggest change to the RegioJet timetable is the addition of the R23 line from Ústí nad Labem, Mělník, Nymburk, and Kolín.
After the success of the transport ministry's competition, Czech Railways will be replaced.
RegioJet will be running a total of 16 trains, eight in each direction.
Other changes involve long-distance connections between Prague and Brno, which will also stop in stations Havlíčkův Brod, Žďár nad Sázavou, and Kolín.
Leo saved 16 connections, two return connections to Slovakia and also weekend connections to Krakow.
The driver of the bus tried to maintain as close to the scheduled travel times of his long-distance trains as possible despite the planned delays.
Without major changes, Arriva and other transport providers should continue to operate.
Trains also change in some regional lines.
Passengers are waiting for example in Českolipsk, where trains from Mladá Boleslav to Rumburk will be replaced by Trilex trains of the German company Die Länderbahn.
Passengers will be able to use the same train tickets for the second year.
As with Czech railways, their price increases by inflationary 3.2%.
I must not agree.
Do we not see the other side?
We heard how much they had to fight for their rights, how they were oppressed and how they died.
In life I never heard teaching from the perspective of the slave-owner or from that time, no one defends it, only condemns it.
Nobody in school taught us that black people often sold other black people into slavery and that they were often the worst slave traders.
No one in school teaches that the colonizers often bought land from the Indians, everywhere they just say how brutally we, Europeans, massacred them, while they were massacring each other for a long time.
I also spent some time in the USA, attending both northern and southern schools.
I have heard that someone is deliberately concealing facts, but I had already suspected something was wrong and it is a problem, even in Japan where the atrocities of WW2 are still taboo.
My point was that history is not black and white, and that we tend to look at it with a modern perspective, without fully understanding it.
They don't understand each other's feelings, it's just how it is and I think it's a fatal mistake to judge without considering the context from that time.
We will learn from this experience and never repeat it again.
When we were in those southern states, yes, the Confederate flag and famous slaveowners are quite popular, but on the other hand they also had some successes and it was absurd to reject them.
In addition, not many people realize how much better it was in the past, as it is idealized by many people in the present.
Not all people in the South were slave owners, and many things were also fought against them.
That person deliberately omits certain facts, lies and manipulates, and our point of view is not taken into account (there is a video on YouTube of someone speaking about our legionaries and 1968).
It was strange for schools in the US to idealize Marxism and communism, something that their country had never experienced.
I was told that some universities were overwhelmed, the students were too radicalized, and the schools supported them multiple times.
When I imagine that these people will one day be much older, I feel a bit uneasy, because it could be the voice of the majority, since among the young and even in the ruling elite.
I think feminism has already achieved what it set out to do and has since become radicalized.
In the present day, feminists are those who have nothing in common with each other and ignore basic biological facts, which leads to radicalization on both sides, often resulting in opposition to even quite reasonable things.
The more radical someone is, the louder they will be heard.
Eventually, I also encountered the fact that someone might judge me for colonialism or slavery.
I met with bad geography, but it was mutual :D
I wouldn't like it here, but it's pointless anyway.
I want to be able to do something that I couldn't do by myself.
I do not consider nationality in general to be superfluous from the perspective of any personal identity.
If we share interests, perspectives on the world, and experiences together, instead of where we were born.
I am not a believer, but from what I know, I can tell you this: We have two Greek Catholic churches, one Ukrainian and one Slovak.
A Slovak priest is really funny, he usually talks more about theology than politics, but he always finds a way to slip in a joke about the coronavirus, that we are all ashamed.
Here, of course, is the Czechoslovak Hussite Church.
They are officially Protestants, but in reality they have grown out of Catholic Modernism and are actually Catholic without a Pope.
I know a lot of people who are Catholic, but they attend services with the Husites, since it is theologically very similar, but the members are usually more liberal.
The beautiful and historically very valuable Functionalist church is located on the street Botanická.
St. Michael's Church on Dominican Square belongs to the Dominicans and they even hold a Latin mass there every Sunday at 3 pm, just as it was done at the Vatican II.
A pine cone from Bethlehem is in Czech Republic, scouts took it from Austria.
Břeclav - A Christmas tree lit up in Bethlehem, where according to Christian tradition, Jesus Christ was born, is in the Czech Republic.
He didn't go to Vienna this time due to the pandemic, but his Austrian colleagues picked him up at the border crossing Reintal – Břeclav.
They took the food from the table.
The Bethlehem Light is a beautiful Christmas tradition that we look forward to every year.
I am proud that I was chosen, said Amálie Budíková to the present journalists.
The handover took place at the border crossing of Mikulov-Drasenhofen, directly on the border bridge, now at the Reintal-Břeclav car park.
Scouts usually go to Vienna by train.
Nothing changes when a spark travels around the Czech Republic.
Scouts traditionally departed by train first to Brno, where they hand over the diocesan bishop Vojtěch Cikrle.
Scouting leaders will pick up the torch on Saturday, December 18th, and travel by both express trains and personal cars.
Scouts or volunteers will take over the lighting of stations in Czech Republic, and they will continue to spread the flame throughout the country, wherever the tracks lead.
I must adhere to the necessary measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19.
It happens like this.
We would like to recommend to the courier teams, as well as organizers of local events, to wear face masks, maintain a safe distance, refrain from singing with colleagues, and behave in a manner that is as safe as possible, said Zuzana Hrbková, spokesperson for the Bethlehem Light event.
The light of Bethlehem, which travels across Europe, was born in 1986 in Austria.
The goal is to spread both the idea of comfort, friendship, and peace at the same time.
The Bethlehem light is a symbol of hope, light that conquers darkness.
In the Czech Republic, scouts and guides have been involved in its spread for more than 30 years.
Akce stands on hundreds of volunteers, flames are also a symbol of purity and humanity.

I do not have an economic education, so I am not familiar with the basics of economics, but I do not think that subsidies as a whole would be a problem.
Development of infrastructure, ecology (e.g. water conservation), healthcare and education properly utilize the money, but why do you spend it on agriculture, industry and firms in general?
It is mentioned - unnecessary products are produced and it overlaps the free market and "disrupts" the company's life.
I work in a factory where there are a million pieces of scrap "XY" and this company is just barely keeping its head above water.
That company which gives work to x people, this is the steering of development, when this company holds and takes orders from other firms, which could then grow and become more productive.
Yes, that's great.
Sometimes a person born in the internet age can get caught up in some kind of trick or scam - especially advertising.
I sometimes think that internet ads don't bother me, but then I realize that they have influenced me - it's just too much of a hassle to try to resist them.
I support radical voices in the European Parliament, which currently want to completely ban programmatic (= targeted) advertising...
I will forbid you to use the internet.
I have mostly roots in (point 1).
I don't believe anything that most people believe, I'd rather believe something that is less probable, but it's important that I have my own opinion which is critical thinking.
I will not believe everything that the media says.
I don't trust politicians.
There will be two hundred premieres of Christmas films this year, compared to last year.
Los Angeles - A television station and streaming platform in the United States and other English-speaking countries has fallen behind the trend of Christmas movies and this year will premiere more than two hundred and fifty.
He calculated the IMDb film database.
The popularity of Christmas and romantic films in recent years has been increasing significantly, which leads to more of these films being made, resulting in higher viewership.
Four times more Christmas movies were made in 20
The IMDb database included only movies with the word "Christmas" in their title, so there will be many more Christmas movies.
People have always associated certain movies with Christmas.
In English, this sentence is translated as "In Czech, this period is associated with, for example, fairy tales, which are popular all over the world, such as the films Home Alone, Love is a Beautiful Thing from 1946.
The real Christmas movies started in 2009, when the American cable television network Hallmark launched a special film series. This was reported by the BBC.
The Christmas Countdown project then included four films and was very successful.
The Christmas train has been running since October 22nd and will show 42 Christmas scenes.
Lifetime has 35 new Christmas-themed movies this year and popular streaming platforms such as Netflix are also contributing to the total.
In this magical period, what matters most is that there are lots of Christmas trees in the background and it's snowing, according to Brandon Gray, the author of the book I'll Be Home for Christmas Movies (Na vánoční filmy budu doma).
For the foreigners, it is an escape and a way to feel some calmness in the middle of all the crazy celebrations and craziness of the world we have been living in the last few years, added Gray.
For example, Hallmark uses the same recipe for its films, which is uniform but successful.
You have two lovers, who are passionate about each other, but then there will be about half an hour before the end of some kind of misunderstanding, which is however successfully resolved and they kiss.
As long as all the movies look the same and have a similar atmosphere, people will keep watching them, according to Gray.

California has banned the sale of weapons.
He plans to defy the ban on abortion in Texas.
Governor Gavin Newsom of California announced a plan to restrict the sale and production of certain weapons in the most populous American state through the use of a legal mechanism, which Texas implemented in its controversial law banning abortions after detecting a heartbeat of the embryo.
Anyone who manufactures or sells assault weapons in California has a legal obligation to compensate the victims of the crime.
Newsom's Response to the US Supreme Court's Friday ruling, which upheld a nearly 50-year-old precedential decision that established the right to abortion nationwide, roughly up to 24 weeks of pregnancy.
However, he did not decide the constitutionality of the whole law, but rather the technical issue that arises from the innovative construction of the measures.
The prohibition was transferred to the public in this case, thereby preventing it from being challenged through the usual legal channels by the Texan Republicans.
I am outraged by the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States, which allowed most of the Texas abortion ban and largely supported the maneuver of Texas to protect its law.
If states can block federal courts from reviewing their laws, then California will use this power to protect human lives, according to Newsom.
He appointed them to work together with the state parliament and the minister of justice to come up with measures that would allow the public to seek a ban on assault rifles and so-called "weapons of the spirit".
These homemade weapons, which lack serial numbers and could be used to circumvent regulations, are marked as such.
Voters in California will be able to demand compensatory damages of at least $10,000 (over 220,000 CZK) from any individual who manufactures, distributes, or sells assault weapons, components for "ghost guns", or ammunition in the state.
Governor of California Jerry Brown stated that the most effective way to keep these dangerous weapons out of our streets is to create the threat of private lawsuits, which we should exactly do that.
The Agency AP reports that California has been prohibiting the production and sale of certain military-style weapons for decades, but a federal judge recently overturned this ban as unconstitutional.
Now that the ban has been reinstated using the Texas model, the words of liberal members of the Supreme Court, such as Sonia Sotomayor, who dissented in the 7-2 majority opinion, have come to fruition: they warned against the expansion of this legal mechanism to other American states.
The Supreme Court, however, did not fully exempt Texas from legal challenge and allowed abortion clinics in the state to continue filing lawsuits against certain individuals and organizations in the South.
Each emergency vaccination goes through a public testing phase, during which the scheme is gradually developed and improved, based on the results.
From Israel, many people study the effects of 4 doses.
As a result of these studies, most patients experience a fivefold increase in antibodies, which has a long-term effect.
Every other vaccination will have its own vaccination scheme, but it's too soon to tell.
Another fact is that a new vaccine, based on an inactivated virus, is expected to be released soon, according to the manufacturer's specifications, which promises up to 10 times greater efficacy.

The Polish government has threatened to halt payments to the EU budget.
The European Commission acted against the law, if it used its new powers and stopped the payment of money to Poland.
The Polish government has postponed approval of the plan to draw 36 billion euros from the European Union's recovery fund to revitalize the economy hit by the COVID-19 pandemic.
The European Parliament is pushing for further progress and the use of mechanisms to withdraw EU subsidies from countries that violate the principles of the rule of law.
Poland should respond to this blackmail from the EU by voting as one in all matters that require unanimity, said Ziobro, head of the small Solidarity Poland party, without whose votes the current government would lose a majority in the Sejm.
Poland should weigh its obligations in the European Union's energy and climate policy, which are leading to drastic increases in energy prices, said Ziobro.
If the sport continues, I will demand that Poland stops its contributions to the EU.
The Polish minister said that the EU unlawfully withholds funds from us, which we also contribute to the common budget.
Her party takes a more radical stance than the ruling party, which is centrist.
The European Commission has changed Poland's justice system during Ziobro's tenure, threatening its independence and allowing politicians to interfere.
Brussels is striving for impossible conditions because its goal is not to create a legal state, but to change the government in Poland.
Warsaw is facing "a political dictate imposed by intimidation and the attempt to undermine the democratic decision of several million Poles," said Ziobro.
He said that Poland should be a member of such an EU, which is based on the partnership of sovereign states, not on the rule of the strongest countries and the Brussels bureaucracy, which is not under democratic control.
He said that his side will never accept any concessions from Brussels that would compromise Poland's sovereignty.
We will never agree to make Poland a colony.

Two years have passed, and people are still arguing about whether to vaccinate or not. Most opponents of vaccination are only slightly more extreme than most supporters.
Discussions on a professional level take place, but extreme views make their way into the public arena.
Stick to the wall.

When I was a child, I was punished with a switch.
Never mind the marks, usually it was just that I refused to listen and scolded (read instead of going to sleep, washed the dishes etc).
I was never punished without warning, my mother would always threaten me first, saying that if I did it again she would give me a slap (sometimes even after I had already been scolded).
After that, I repeatedly refused to listen, and I received a few slaps on the backside (over my clothing).
I believe physical punishments (in the right implementation and degree) are beneficial, as children react much more to them than to words.
It is important that you pay attention to this part because it gives children the opportunity to choose whether they will listen or not and whether they will improve or not.
I usually only needed a warning to start listening.
Defend the system.
When renowned Czech lawyer and Constitutional Court judge Vojtěch Cepl was asked by a journalist in 1999 what the Czech Constitution meant to him - whether it was a sacred document that was sworn to and taught in schools, or rather a contract that could be changed if necessary - he unequivocally chose the first interpretation.
We agreed in the constitution on democratic rules of our life, which at the same time define who the state and its citizens are, and to better save changes.
Imagine: Some nations have their own rules that they enjoy following.
Vojtěch Cepl asked the question, "Do Czechs like dumplings with pork and sauerkraut?"
In the last few years, there has been a growing opinion among lawyers that the Czech Constitution needs to be changed.
The creators of the situation (to whom Vojtěch Cepl belonged) could not predict, for example, the behavior of the elected president.
He had the truth in one thing.
We know from such documents that political interference in their text must be thought through.
It is necessary to understand and actively defend it, otherwise it can be the key to solving most of the crises that confront societies throughout history.
The Constitution is composed of various rules of government, which establish the boundaries of play for politicians.
We fear that it will be abused against minorities or individuals, so we bind policies with restrictions.
The constitutional texts also enable politicians to exercise their power.
Several people in FN Brno are fighting for the life of a few-month-old kitten.
Although the virus is usually milder with children, there are also difficult cases that hospitals have been facing mainly in the last few weeks.
He said that children are vulnerable and affected to a lesser extent than adults, speaking of 2 to 5 percent compared to adults, according to Primář Kliniky dětské anesteziologie a resuscitace Fakultní nemocnice Brno and Masaryk University's Faculty of Medicine Petr Dominik.
The course of events is usually simpler, lighter, and often occurs without symptoms.
Children are particularly vulnerable to the coronavirus, as we can see especially in the last period, said Dominik.
According to the doctor, there are dozens of children who need gentle supportive care.
You are listening to a podcast about childhood infectious diseases.
Very seriously ill children with coronavirus are only recently admitted to ARU.
Children with COVID-19 syndromes were continuously monitored by a doctor throughout the entire year.
Today there is an increase in children with acute covid-19 pneumonia, which means they require intensive care in a hospital setting. This illness affects both adolescents and newborns as well.
In hospitals, children are also found in critical condition due to the COVID-19 virus.
Currently, we have babies of all ages, as well as adolescents, lying here in the hospital, said the doctor.
However, so far, there have been no reported deaths of children in the pediatric hospital FN Brno due to the coronavirus.
Six children aged 0 to 14 years old died in the Czech Republic on December 6th.
Dominika is working in a children's hospital – not just on the coronavirus ward – as an integral part of the psychologist's work.
It also warns that, like with adults, vaccination can reduce the severity of the illness and decrease the prevalence of post-COVID syndrome.
The doctor recommended vaccine doses for children, too.
In the quiet zone, you can only walk along the marked paths.
Child-free zones are not as large as they seem.

In national parks outside the quiet zone, you can go wherever you want (but don't cross the fence into the fields).
You must not ride a bike in the forest unless you have a permission (but of course, it is not monitored in national parks).

He collaborates with the Hradec Philharmonic, the Film Philharmonic, or the Podkrkonošsky Symphony Orchestra.
China is building the impression of being able to handle the outbreak and the authoritarian regime is facing a crisis better.
China is building a reputation for dealing with epidemics and the authoritarian regime is facing a crisis better.
China has launched a medical and political offensive.
Beijing reflected criticism for its failure to stop the outbreak, which had transformed into a global pandemic.
Today, the country reports no increase in infected people.
States including China are competing to obtain Chinese protective tools and Chinese doctors are helping in the fight against the virus, for example in the most affected Italy.
Do you want to visit Beijing?

At some point they meet and the one who bought it complains: you fool, what did you buy that for a elephant?
The garden is overgrown, the car is crushed, the children are fighting and the wife wants to get a divorce.
You are speaking nicely about the elephant, but you won't give it away...
World events are controlled by the powers that be.
Despite the equality of sovereign states, it is the great powers that determine the course of international affairs.
Europe can become a great power only if it works on its integration.
Economic and political issues have been addressed, but military integration is still lacking.
I believe Europe is heading towards federalization.

I am not proficient in Czech, so I may need to use a dictionary.
I usually include two different units on the same level in an ellipse.
I will take an example from another commentary "Spanish oranges and mandarins, where it is clear that they are both from Spain, whereas with "Spanish fruit and mandarins" it is not clear that they are from Spain.
I also rely on the fact that the sentence "všech amerických sil" translates to "including their weapons" and that I know that American complexes are operated only by Americans.
In other words, I expect that it is already included in that broad concept and there is no need to further specify it for American forces.
I'll try, maybe just with words :D
Either way, it's a silly request.
An earthquake of magnitude five was recorded.
Tokyo and its surrounding areas were hit by a earthquake of magnitude 5.0 on Sunday.

No warnings were issued about the tsunami, Reuters reported.
Vicki Holland from Britain tortured a mouse called Milly.
Disturbing images show the moment when the terrified monkey was running away in the bathroom, as its heartless owner laughed and mocked it.
Hollandová also fed the birds, kebabs and hamburgers, regardless of her actual nutritional needs.
The Magistrate's Court in Gwent has now permanently banned the keeping of animals, according to the newspaper The Sun.
The medical staff caring for Milly, who were horrified by her treatment, declared that they had never seen a more distressed animal.
Milly spent almost two years rehabilitating workers at Monkey World in Dorset and is now happily playing with another rescued monkey named Moon.
The mother of four admitted to two charges of causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal.
The court in Gwent imposed a twelve-day prison sentence with a conditional suspension of the sentence for one year.
Hollandová was also sentenced to 120 hours of unpaid labor, she has been banned from owning animals for life, and must pay 12,000 Czech crowns in court fees.
The team leader, Steph Sawyer, said, "Milly is doing well, but her rehabilitation will continue further."
Milly was used to people.
She cowered away from everyone she encountered and any loud noise or sudden movement startled her.
She refused to eat for a long time.
Now that she has settled in and is happy with her mate, the sight of new people can still evoke panic in her.
Scars from torture will follow you forever, says Sawyer.
Police in Gwent discovered disturbing footage on Milly's phone after conducting a raid on her apartment due to accusations of drug use.
You can hear Milly swearing vociferously in the background.
In the next video, you will hear a Dutch monkey offer cocaine and say, "Do you want cocaine?".
You have touched my fingers.
In May, with her partner Russell Cox (43), she admitted to possessing cocaine with the intention of selling it.
In my house, cocaine was found hidden in Kinder eggs.
Cox was then imprisoned for 30 months and Holland was given a conditional sentence of 20 months.

Run down the street and randomly ask people if they can solve the quadratic equation and its coefficients.
Everyone has gone through it, and almost everyone will not even shrug and say they have absolutely no idea what you're talking about.
What are you learning?
I am a big fan of general knowledge and the reality is that people don't want it and don't need it.
It is unnecessary to do that in the future and you will never get the same result.
Some people are learning it for a lot of people who will need it.
You don't need to do anything with this machine, I thought it was serious... because you don't need to.
We also slowly get to the time when we don't know the sign of punctuation.
We probably contributed to our communist past and persecution of intellectuals and elites, but the price of that is high.

The wedding is still going on: Kadri's and Andrey's war continues!
This is the main reason why Switzerland cannot leave immediately," replied Andrea on Instagram Stories in response to curious fans' questions, who were disappointed that she decided to end all contact and even block them on social media.
Mike and Andrew have been shredding documents since the beginning of the experiment.
The main problem was that Kadri was living and working in Switzerland and his idea was that Andrea would follow him, at least until he returned to Czech permanently.
She resolutely refused.
You can see that their relationship did not end in love, but rather grew into mutual contempt and hatred.
You were planning an attack! Kadri was angered by Andreina's accusations of lying, gambling, and debt.
Kadir's ex-wife did not like his younger sister Linda.
He decided to publicly support his brother.
We never talked about such things in our family and never mentioned them extraordinarily.
He definitely will cause some regret.
When I see someone trying to discredit someone I care about, it really bothers me!
I am sorry to have to take this path, but I would like to publicly thank my brother Kadr for his character and for helping our family when we needed it most, even though he was so young.
I freeze when I have to read such false information, which is probably taken out of context.
I wish everyone knew Kadri as I do, our close ones and family, in reaction to Andrey's words.
I am really grateful for everything!
People will believe what is written, but the most important thing is that we, his family, love him and know the truth and know what really happened, unconditionally.
The thief climbed up the facade to the fifth floor.
You are shivering, why?
Chao started a burglary mission at a parking lot in a residential district, trying to break into several cars.
From the available information, it was determined that the driver had stolen approximately 330 Czech crowns from the vehicle.
You won't find anything better than climbing up to the fifth floor and opening the window to sneak into the apartment.
He picked two apples.
From one security camera, we can see him walking away from the scene of the crime and eating a banana.
When the owner of the apartment woke up in the morning, he discovered that the bananas were not where they were supposed to be and he called the police.
We will wait for you.
He admitted that he had consumed alcohol on the day in question.
Because he needed money, he decided to steal while intoxicated.
That thing is still being investigated.
He climbed up the facade to the fifth floor, where he stole two bananas.
The pandemic law is time-limited and subject to pandemic readiness.

A total of four new or repeated elections to municipal councils, and especially the highly anticipated elections to the Chamber of Deputies, was announced by the Chairwoman of the Czech Statistical Office, Eva Krumpová.
She recalled that due to the COVID-19 pandemic, preparations for the elections were more demanding in terms of equipment and personnel security.

John is playing with the fool so that he can have someone to talk to.
If not, it's not bad.
I think Christians are degenerates, nor anything like that.
I enjoy seeing a lot of church buildings from an aesthetic point of view (which was the goal, so that they would look good).
I believe in one God.
On the other side, I am amazed by how much power the Church had in the Middle Ages, how much money it accumulated, the suppression of knowledge, etc.
He never fought in any wars, not even the thirty-year war.
You might believe in a spaghetti monster, but the church and state have nothing to do with each other.
A man fell headfirst from a height of twelve meters.
The concrete survived.
An unbelievable fall survived by a man in Ostrava, where rescue workers intervened.
Workers at the regional operations center took the hour after Saturday night's half-past midnight to receive the initial information about a man who had fallen from a height.
The two crews of ZZS – medical and paramedical – immediately left.
When the medical staff arrived at the scene, they discovered that the 17-year-old man had fallen from a height of around 12 meters and hit his head on the concrete!
In Vítkovice, they are mining for coal.
They didn't have to go to the fire station, but the firefighters went anyway.
When the rescue teams arrived, a man was found unconscious with multiple injuries and in imminent danger of death.
The doctor inserted a tube into his breathing passages, secured artificial ventilation, and other measures within the pre-hospital care, and then an ambulance transported him to the trauma center in Ostrava, where the spokesperson for the ZZS Moravian-Silesian Region, Lukáš Humpl, informed.
I am more afraid of the wrong reactions of the public and the authorities than of the coronavirus.
The spread of coronavirus in the Czech Republic means a challenge for politicians and civil servants, but first and foremost for doctors and healthcare personnel.
How serious is the situation from their perspective?
We are talking to military doctor David Rezáč.

What is the difference between ten kyčel and ta kyčel?
It's not difficult at all.
Most common Czech names only express one grammatical gender, making it difficult to determine whether they are masculine, feminine, or neuter.
There are quite a few essential names, whose gender is not fixed.
The names vary between two genders.
When conjugated, they take on two endings and in some cases remain unchanged.
For example, the words "svízel" and "kyčel" are both of the masculine and feminine gender, in the first case they follow the pattern of "machine", in the second case they follow the pattern of "song".
Other significant names have different forms in the first person singular, such as: "row/rowd", "kedluben/kedlubna" or "brambor/brambora" (in the sense of food).
The words are written, have the same meaning, and are therefore interchangeable.
Some words can vary regionally, for example the word "okurka" in the Czech Republic and "okurek" in Moravia, in this case the Moravian variant is non-standard, similar to other Czech-Moravian pairs such as "příkop" and "příkopa", "kobliha" and "koblih" etc.
Some words which have entered the Czech language from other languages were originally non-inflecting, but have since adopted Czech endings.
A typical example is the word "image", which is of both masculine and feminine gender, or the word "buffet", which remains in the middle gender but has endings according to the pattern "grad".
Turkey opened a pathway for migrants to Europe.
What is the situation at the Greek borders?
Tension exists between Greece and Turkey due to the increasing number of migrants who are trying to further their journey into Europe.
Thousands of people began to cross the Schengen border after Ankara stopped protecting them.
European politicians have promised Greece financial support and humanitarian aid is also being prepared by the Czech government.
Why does migration motivate people to take the uncertain journey?
What is the situation like at the scene?
We have not seen the blue sky for three months and we have been suffering, according to the journalist from Sydney.
Bushfires in Australia have been raging for four months, killing nearly 30 people and hundreds of millions of animals, and ravaging millions of hectares of land.

Lenka Kabrhelová is speaking with journalist Ikou Detrichová from Sydney.
False accusations are always rare.
Everyone always writes completely everywhere.
Sexual violence is a huge problem in our society and it is trying to be covered up.
I don't know anyone who was falsely accused.
I am familiar with many people who have been victims of sexual assault and I have experienced how their loved ones and even the police often treat them with indifference.
You should always believe in them.
It has become clear that the victims are finally opening up about their traumas.
Many people leave it for themselves.
Nobody accuses falsely.
You are spreading the idea that "most accusations are fabricated" and that it is "a trend" that helps sexual offenders.
The Czech Republic is flooding unfinished homes, families do not have the money to complete them.
The cost of construction materials increased by more than 30% in the last weeks and months.
A number of people found themselves in a tricky situation.
They refuse to increase mortgage loans from the bank.
The cost of materials increases along with the cost of construction work.
People do not have enough money to finish the already started family homes.
In many cases, banks refuse to increase home loan amounts, which creates an extremely unpleasant situation.
In the best case, people move to unfinished and unoccupied homes.
In the worst case, empty houses are uninhabitable and families are forced to sell them because they cannot afford to pay mortgages and rent.
We will put up two to three family homes and at fifty percent, it happened to us.
It is difficult for us as a construction firm to adhere to certain things contractually, even though the material has become more expensive.
Zdeněk Slivoň said, "We are doing it without profit."
Only a few people will have financial problems.
They had expected the construction of the house to cost five million, but it will now cost seven.
I think some will be waiting," added Slivon.
I was most impressed by the amount of metal, including iron, steel, and installation and welding equipment.
Construction companies also struggle with a lack of available workers.
In Czech, there is a shortage of graduates from construction-related fields, and the influx of foreign workers is slowing the spread of the pandemic.
The situation regarding the issuance of building permits is currently favorable.
The Building Authorities in October issued 7,675 building permits, which is almost 10% more than last year, clarified Křeček.
We are doing well and will continue to do so.
The commentator for ČRo – MujRozhlas says that there is a lack of clarity.
Entry into the new year was traditionally accompanied by both classical celebrations and political speeches.

Did we learn anything essential?
When I get my degree, I will have my own topic which I chose, which is based on my bachelor's degree, and I will be working on it for a year and then I will write it down in two weeks.
Státnice are completely still, as long as there is no total makak and something remains in his head, the committee will not bother him with theory.
When I was learning statecraft for a week, and when I was at the end, the commission always tried to lead me to some logical deduction, which I immediately understood.
We have done this many times, it is really beneficial, and we learn a lot. Then they just have to do the project and they will have it done.
I'm really glad when the project ends with an exam, instead of just a defense.
Everything is okay, I am not sending any emails or making any phone calls to the embassy.
You are as crazy as they are.
You don't have to have anything in common with those people.
If they were against Russia, they would have taken a lot of risk, so they may have to play with them, otherwise something bad could happen.
You can build a statue of Putin next to the statue of a mouse.
You should give him a pat on the shoulder or something.
I agree, even though Instagram is kicking artists' legs under the table.
Every day you share at least one story, and every other day you post a new picture, until your posts reach a bare minimum.
Besides changing the navigation, which is more important, a comment or storage.
I was really scared in the last few days, so I might have to slow down to a ticktock, where there are a lot of successful artists from my field and they don't want to stop.
It would be great if there was something user-friendly, pleasant, and inspiring from the artists that would utilize all their creativity and energy.
Statement of the Working Group on Donbass.
The image on the screen expresses the opinion of the opposers of the dissolution of the USSR.
Thirty years since the illegal dissolution of the USSR.
The greatest geopolitical catastrophe in human history occurred in December 1991.
On December 8th, 1991, Boris Yeltsin, Leonid Kravchuk and Stanislav Shushkevich, without any legal authority and violating the results of the referendum of March 17th, 1991, secretly and without regard for the people, signed a treaty, whereby the "Soviet Union as a subject of international law and as a geopolitical reality ceases to exist.
One flea destroyed a huge planet with almost three million inhabitants.
The dissolution of the USSR resulted in millions of ethnic Russian citizens around the world becoming stateless.
From the beginning of the 1990s, the population of Russia decreased by ten to eleven million.
We have lost more people than in two world wars combined!
Those same people, who in one sitting destroyed what was built over the previous seventy years, betrayed the socialist camp (created by the sacrifice of millions of lives in both World War II and the Great Patriotic War).
Aware of the industrial decline, they disrupted agriculture, broke away from the greatest world power, which had previously been economically linked in a single mechanism.
If we want to go deeper, we will see a decrease in population, an economic collapse, a decline in science, an increase in crime, inter-ethnic conflicts, the war in Chechnya, all the conflicts in the post-Soviet space, the Orange Revolutions, NATO's expansion to the east, the war in Syria - all of this is the result of geopolitical surrender, first of the socialist camp, and then of the Soviet Union.
There is such a concept in political science as "power vacuum".
Everything that had been rushed and surrendered was quickly filled and conquered by NATO countries which had accepted our geopolitical capitulation.
The entire world is still reeling from the events of the late 1980s and early 1990s.
The quality and quantity of the product sold in the supermarket does not necessarily have to correspond.
We have some meat in the supermarket that costs 189 Kč / kg.
I will buy it with the understanding that I will give it to you for lunch and make something from it for dinner on Thursday.
In an alternative reality, where I don't buy meat on Mondays, I can get it for 99 Kč / kg - please explain the mechanism by which this is beneficial for my digestive system?
I am waiting for the butcher to reduce the price of the meat by 69 Kč / kg - what makes this meat different from the one I bought on Monday for 120 Kč and left in my fridge for 3 days?
I answer myself - nothing.
That's right, when something is cheap, it has to be subpar, shoddy, or of poor quality. I'll tell you the truth - it's terrible!
Yesterday I went to Brno to hand out flyers, similar to the ones I always read, in order to help the brigade members, who cannot...
The book was full of peasant wisdom and conservative views on how the world works, but nothing about God, I was confused, but I sensed it was some kind of agitprop.

She began to physically block the doors.
He had a great relationship with her for a year and a half, but then it slowly started to deteriorate over the course of six months.
I ended the relationship with her by telling her that I was going to say goodbye and leave her, but I could still talk to her the next week to try to calm her down and make sure she's okay.
That person from you extracts emotions and overall joy.
He was holding back.

After several years of dormancy and suppression of this illicit business, MLM recruiting is once again back on the rise.
I was one of the recruits, I tried to learn as much as I could (I was 20 years old, a freshman at university), but quickly realized that product knowledge and commercial skills were not of interest to me.
I was interested in the products I offer, since I wanted to help people, but the training was more to scare and intimidate people.
When the first earned money came, a person quickly realized that if they want to earn, they must invest several certain products monthly.
Investment life insurance and mortgages were the only profitable ventures, so people felt like door-to-door salesmen.
I can say that experience was valuable, people learned that they should not jump to conclusions and thoroughly verify information.
He did not share any of the food with anyone.
People in this business are successful and even beneficial to others, but they will not be celebrating with expensive consumer goods or "fat" accounts.
I have never worked in a corporate environment before.
Human resources are in a state of rest, managers are looking for their management and power is not wasted on us.
We usually evaluate ourselves in the form of setting goals for the next year and then looking back at what went well and what didn't. It's more of a self-evaluation, rather than someone else evaluating you based on some numbers, and similar.
Firemní akce are also optional.
We are somewhat unique within our company - the departments that are more "corporate".
Sometimes a person feels like we are such a startup, which is squatting in the offices of a large corporation.
We are not affected by the results as long as the results are pending.
The Czech missing person in Britain is dead.
Her body was found in London.
The British police have been unsuccessfully searching for a 32-year-old Czech woman who went missing at the end of November.

The British police this afternoon confirmed to our embassy in London that they had found the body of the missing Czech citizen.
The cause of death is being investigated.
We will not be sharing any more information with the family.
Kulhánek, on Twitter, expressed sincere sympathy.
You last saw a woman on November 28th while she was getting off the bus on her way home from work. She had just withdrawn money from the ATM.
Her disappearance was reported by her colleagues five days later.
The London police began to search for her, Interpol added her to their list of wanted people worldwide.
It was found in the Czech database of missing persons.
The police have been holding one man for several days.
He was supposed to play a role, but he was suspicious of her and didn't reveal it.

That is the biggest problem I have with the pandemic.
We had a dangerous contagious illness at the beginning, but it passed quickly without any major complications.
I have a problem with the majority of the population treating it like it's no big deal.
I'm looking forward to tomorrow because thanks to vaccination I will finally be less dependent on others.
The president lost his function and capacity, but he was able to regain it.
There is a chance that it will happen, but others mention it rarely.
Even if I am not sure, whether the act of shredding the documents could be considered as treason, it is better to be safe than sorry.

Something serious must be done.
The pandemic has impacted intimate life: The number of people aged 35 and under who are not having sex has increased significantly.
More and more young adults in the USA are living their lives without sex.
This article is mainly about religious people, according to the Daily Mail.
Research showed that from 2008 to 20
Women between the ages of 18 and 35, who stated that they had not had any sexual contact in the last year, are more numerous than ever before.
In addition to the number of sexually active individuals, other factors, such as the Institute for Family Studies (IFS) showed.
One of the effects of the coronavirus pandemic and higher unemployment.
Media, social networks, and video games can also contribute to making sex seem less important for young people.
Since 2010, the proportion of men and women aged 18 to 35 who reported having had no sex in the previous year has grown, according to IFS researcher Lyman Stone.
In marriage, sexual activity is more frequent, with 5% of people reporting that they were sexually active in 2021, compared to the previous year.
There were 29% free people. Stone added that marriage before the age of 35 is only a small percentage.
Reducing sexual activity also contributes to fear of premarital sex and religious foundations.
Despite the fact that there is a greater likelihood that married couples will be sexually active, the percentage of married women under the age of 35 is still declining.
Young people's opinions on pre-marital sex is divided, about 30% think it's a bad thing, while roughly 70% believe it's okay.
It is true that among free individuals in this age group, they are a minority, but their behavior is slowly changing this trend, says Stone about these thirty percent.
Most people who have moral objections to premarital sex do so because of their religious beliefs.
Since 2008, the proportion of young people aged 35 and under who attend religious gatherings more than once a month has increased from 20% to almost 60%.
According to Stone, the number of non-believers has risen from 10% to 20%.
Sexual activities also contribute other factors, such as less social interaction and mainly social drinking alcohol during the pandemic.
Studies showed that the probability of sex is lower among people without jobs or with lower incomes.
Another reason may be the expansion of digital media, which presumably reduces the need for sex.
People spend more time online, thereby replacing this need.
This trend has been particularly prominent during the lockdown period due to the pandemic of COVID-19.
Vaccinating against COVID-19 is about whether a society should mandate certain behaviors that people don't want to do, but which could save their lives.
That is a rather difficult question which I am most interested in personally.
For example, if we don't order them and they die, it will be our fault.
My argument is that we could certainly have blamed an 80-year-old man who was unaware of the facts, had misheard some misinformation, and ultimately succumbed to the illness.
On the other hand, I don't think we can blame the deceased opponent of vaccination, who was alongside SPD and KSČ in something about discrimination and totalitarian state.
The majority of unvaccinated pensioners probably belong to the second group, so they will have to bear the consequences themselves.
No snow in Czech.
How cold winter writes a battle with drought?
Last winter in the Czech Republic brought one of the smallest snowfalls in recent times.
The organizers of ski areas cannot avoid technical snow, which can even complicate the preparations for the Jizerska 50 ski race.
Is this a trend or an exception?
Will there be snow in Czech Republic?
She had one story to tell, but it was not about a knight in shining armor.
One day our teacher led us through the entire city to the dock, so that we could sail down the river on a boat.
We are walking down this wide street and don't see anyone in the middle - followers of the Hare Krishna sect.
We fell asleep naturally.
I luckily escaped, but I was talking with one friend.
When she left, we both cried, along with the teacher who was saying goodbye to her.
Tell me, do you want to save your soul?
I told her that I have no soul.
We were all dismayed until we reached the dock.
We are overwhelmed with joy.
It's breaking down, Orozovic says.
New German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, after previous visits to Paris and Brussels, arrived in Warsaw on Sunday, where he was welcomed by Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki with military honors.
Opening a new chapter in relations, said Morawiecki at the joint press conference following the talks.
Scholz emphasized that Europe must make it clear that it will not accept the violation of Ukraine's territorial integrity.
The chaotic movements of Russian troops near the Ukrainian border, according to the Chancellor, must be addressed through diplomatic negotiations, including within the "Normandy Group", which brings together France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine.
Morawiecki announced that the Chancellor informed him about the situation on the Polish border with Belarus, whose leader Alexander Lukashenko has artificially created a migration crisis and uses people as guinea pigs and a weapon, as we witness hundreds of attempts (to illegally) cross the border every night.
The Prime Minister was discussing further sanctions against Lukašenko's regime and its patrons in the Kremlin so that they finally understand that we are determined to defend the eastern border of the EU.
Scholz from the DPA said that Warsaw expects German support in the dispute with Belarus, and condemned the inhumane treatment of the Lukašenko regime against protesters.
The Polish nun caused the misfortune, she tried to hide it.
The car returned to the scene of the accident, but it was driven by a different nun who was trying to take the blame onto herself.
When the police told him that he could lose his driver's license for giving preference in driving and for causing an accident, the truth came out, reported TVN24.
She admitted that another nun had approached her asking for help.
The police came to visit Celestine's sister.
They immediately took away her driver's license after they found out she had two parts per million of alcohol in her blood.
They announced that they will be held accountable for their actions in court.
The dog is doing what it can.
Juraj Šajmovič didn't like his own film.
Czech filmmakers were inspired by American family comedies to create their own.
They forgot the most important thing: the rules of filmmaking.
For the film Forrest Gump - a dog who taught people to live, now dives into the cinemas for another movie - We're Watching.
Juraj Šajmovič Jr. freely continues his previous film Tady hlídám já from 2012 with the same co-author and director.
Hugo the talking dog returns to the stage accompanied by some familiar characters.
Julie, the owner of a summer cottage, is displeased, so she invites pigeons to nest there, along with her father and his partner, and especially her daughter Veronika.
She is not a small child, but a growing girl, who is experiencing her first love.
The director and his partner Beatriz Simovic (who is also the producer of the film) had difficulties telling the story in their previous movie, but at least the children and the dog were entertained.
The creative duo has written a weaker script that evokes a mix of awe and confusion.
Let's trim it down.
Julie, a scientist, is susceptible to witchcraft and black magic, but if the constellation is correct, she will copulate with her forest engineer Ivan, wherever the coordinates are set – on the hood of a car or a church tower (of course, during an excursion with a local guide), even though the veteran colonel Mojmír has been trained in marksmanship and shoots his own daughter (Julie), who then falls into a coma, from which she is taken to a hospital. There, miraculously, she is cured by a dog.
Nature and animal strength are to be protected from pollution.
Their owners know why they have them.
It was necessary to send a message full of uncertain situations and figures.
Two thieves from the staff, a shady character from the forest, a police officer arriving on the scene to look for drugs and discussing the strength of bone marrow soup – and of course, the family in the pension must be drunk.
When she wakes up from a deep sleep and immediately sits at the dinner table with a cigarette in her hand, asking for her father's whiskey and a glass of water as a vegetarian, you can't help but laugh.
The creators explain to the viewer that "it sometimes becomes comical".
The Šajmovič team lacks basic knowledge of dramaturgy, the ability to construct meaningful situations, a sense of characterization and direction.
Performance is uneven, the cutting is careless and the overall impression is disheartening.
Lukáš Vaculík, Jitka Ježková, and Nela Boudová are trying to save their parties, but they don't have much to play with.
The only remaining scenes of the film are the poetic shots of the Bohemian forest by cameraman Vladimir Holomka and the pair of deer.
It fails to sketch out several characters, a complicated plot and popular slang, which the characters indulge in.
Membership in the Club of Goat Breeders is not transferable, like in the case of the producer.
By good intentions to promote nature and friendship between man and dog should be knowledge of craft, if one wants to tell a believable story.
It did not succeed in this case.
A good family photo is a bit too erotic and has minimum sentiment for the genre.
He didn't pass the amateurishly done advertisement for cannibalism.
Yes, respect, because you must listen to constant beeps precisely from the buttons, as you are.
The difference between offering and coercion is clear to you, but that is only because you have never tried it.
The decision is always the customer's, if they don't want it, the response will always be no.
If you had listened to that advice, you might have changed your mind.
Work is work, in any case, a team effort.
The close east troubles unusual dry months.
It is the only time of the year when it rains.
Although rare, Israel Meteorological Service confirms that almost complete lack of rainfall during the month of November is unusual.
For example, the village of Kfar Giladi in northern Israel reports only six percent of its long-term average rainfall in November.
This week's rain was more of an exception than the usual.
It is good for us.
You haven't finished yet.
You have put up the correct Christmas decorations, and the people of Nazareth were delighted.
Rains in Israel mainly occur during the winter months, are unpredictable and intense.
Forests are dependent on winter snow.
Without them, nothing moves and they are prone to fires.
There are no trees, but also no supplies of drinking water and irrigation for farmers.
The largest freshwater source in Israel, Lake Galilee, was filled to the brim this year due to three consecutive wet winters.
From that time onwards, the level of happiness decreased.
Farmers have been warning of the drought for a long time.
It was expected that due to global warming and climate change, there could be a decrease in rainfall here in 2018, according to Uri Schor, spokesperson for the Israel Water Authority.
Israel is helping to develop technologies, such as desalination or recycling of wastewater.
Those are economically weak countries such as Lebanon, Syria, and Jordan.
In the capital city of Jordan, Amman, the number of caravanserais is increasing.
Water from a private well drains slowly.
The driver of a tanker truck, Imád Sulejman, reported that orders have increased by seventy to eighty percent compared to the previous two years.
Clashes between farmers and security forces have erupted in Isfahan.
The reason for the protests was the drought.
The local rivers dried up completely.
The last few years have brought us the driest November.
Israel is preparing a military strike against Iran.
The Israeli Minister of Defense declared that the negotiations in Vienna did not bring any progress and that he had informed Washington about the preparations for an attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.
Benny Gantz, the Israeli Minister of Defense, announced that the Israeli army is preparing for the possibility of a military strike against Iran, according to Jonathan Lis.
A man living in the USA is trying to convince Americans to increase pressure on Iran, but also inform Washington about military preparations.
During the press conference in Florida, Gantz said that nuclear negotiations in Vienna have not made any progress and the world powers understand that the Iranians are playing them.
Three years ago this also happened to me.
I flirted a little and grilled him during the conversation in order to find out what he really wanted.
I finally realized that my suspicion of the pyramid was justified.
Because those pranks really annoy me, I hesitated for a moment with doubts and questions, and then thanked him and left.
Tell me that I laughed, but the pyramid is a pyramid and financial advisors are financial advisors.
Skiers went to the mountains over the weekend, hoping for plenty of snow and nice weather.
Ski centers in the Czech Republic experienced their first major influx of skiers over the weekend.
At the end of the working week, there is no snow emergency and some ski resorts have already started operations.
She did not waver in her obligation to present herself with a COVID-19 certificate at the checkpoints.
Ski rental shops are not worried about the lack of interest from customers, as the demand for their services is weaker than before the pandemic.
Thousands of people went skiing in the Liberec region over the weekend.
Skiers were treated to great weather today, with both sunshine and excellent snow conditions.
We are happy, the weekend skiing trip really went well from the Thursday evening skiing, when we had the first skiers on the mountain, praised the director of the Sporting Area Ještěd Jakub Hanuš.
A lot of people went skiing over the weekend for the first time this season also to Jeseníky.
The ski arena in Karlov or the center in Branná on Šumperk, for example.
The weekend attendance was very good, on Saturday and today an estimated 400 people came.
The conditions are unfavorable.
Sun shone, it was around -3 degrees Celsius, so perfect, praising representative of the ski resort in Branná Rostislav Procházka.
Ski resort operators can sell ski passes only to people who are vaccinated or who have recovered from COVID-19.
René Hroneš from Skicentrum Špindlerův Mlýn said that, with the exception of a few people, everyone is prepared and able to provide the necessary documents.
We recorded only units of incidents, he added.
Some rental and sale businesses are reporting lower demand for skiing and snowboarding equipment since the pandemic.
Luckily, there is a demand for ski rental.
It is not like in the past, but there are still customers, as Alexandra Bokishova from the Skiopava store in Opava said.
Higher demand is expected during the skiing courses period.
Snowbear David Šinták feels that there is less demand for ski and snowboard rental equipment due to Covid-19.
We were almost given away before the pandemic.
We were probably about 50% before the pandemic, said CTK Šinták.
People adapted to the pandemic and learned how to stay home.
The rental office in the Novákova area of ​​Boží Dar is recording a large request.
They began renting ski equipment there a week ago and interested parties must now reserve them in advance.
We are starting to lend this weekend, people were already calling ahead, so we expect a lot of interest, as well as ourselves.
The interest is comparable to the period before the epidemic is also about ski school.
If they want to stay successful and wealthy, they must have the opportunity to enjoy a quality life as if they were abroad.
It does not belong to socialist healthcare, where it is often difficult to find a dentist or a specialist doctor.
People who are wealthy and well-connected leave the country, since they have no property here.
The company will not send its employees abroad.
Without hesitation, I completely agree.
If these people do not live well in the Czech Republic and if these people do not have a good future prospect in the Czech Republic, then there will be no one living in the Czech Republic.
Emigration from Hungary began when Orbán won a beautiful day, governed for a year and suddenly emigration rose by a few tens of thousands.
I naively believe that the Czech Republic can find itself in a similar position day by day.
Other questions are up for grabs.
When you will live here happily, you can also win some traditional V4 crazy games.
Young and educated people will leave, but their supporters and those whose wealth can fit into the plane will remain.
Wow, great photo!
Are you thirsty for a beer?
In the Czech Republic, winter was in full swing, in Thailand, the film's production team, led by Jiří Langmajer (55), took advantage of the tropical climate!
He posted a photo of his bloody face on social media.
Is this an actual injury, or is it for filming?
The London police are still searching for the missing Czech woman.
The last one was seen on the way home.
The disappearance of Petra does not resemble her behavior and we are beginning to worry about her, said Lucy O'Connor from the police station in Lambeth, where Petra worked.
Her family in the Czech Republic also has great fears for her and simply wants to know where she is.
The Czech woman left work on Saturday, November 28th around 7:45 pm and went home to the Camberwell neighborhood.
It was supposedly seen in the bus about half an hour later.
Someone from her colleagues reported her disappearance on December 3rd.
Srncová worked as a "nursing assistant" in the Evelina London Children's Hospital, which is part of the Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust.
We are extremely concerned about our missing friend Petra, who has been unaccounted for, according to a tweet from a group of medical facilities.
We would like to ask anyone who may have any information that could help us find the police, the message continued.
The public is invited to collaborate with Harriet Harman, who on Saturday drew attention to the case of Sophie at a press conference.
She has been missing for several days, she is only 32 years old, she is from the Czech Republic, her parents are understandably distraught, and she is holding a photograph of herself distributed by the London police.
I feel that we all have a great responsibility to try and find her, since she was away from her native country, away from her family and she worked here for our healthcare, as stated by Harmanová.
The police previously detained one man, who remains in custody.
According to the BBC news website, the police have not provided any information about his identity, nor have they revealed what he is suspected of.
Russia cannot occupy Ukraine, certainly not with 30 BTG (approximately 5 divisions).
I do not underestimate Ukraine.
There is not a huge amount, but about 8% of the Russian army.
You are aware that Ukraine constantly repeats that the threat of invasion is diminishing and that our entry is now full of teeth.
I was there.
I don't know why he concluded that Russia wants war.
The war is expensive and Italy has a higher GDP than Russia.
Compared to the situation in 38, I have no idea where to start.
We can compare the First World War and the "Anschluss" of Sicily :D
I can't imagine what will happen after Ukraine announced that it will not abide by the agreements from Minsk; Russia will annex the disputed republics.
That concentration at the boundaries corresponded to what was expected.
Ono, promises must be kept...
On weekends, new bus timetables come into effect, mainly affecting urban connections.
Passengers in the Prague Integrated Transport (PID) are waiting for several changes, which mainly affect suburban connections.
New links were created, some changed the route, while others disappeared.
Mladoboleslavsko is now joining the integrated system.
In the main city, the express trains from České Budějovice stop at the Zahradní Město station on weekends.
The S7 trains depart from the city of Beroun and travel along the route to the Czech Brodu, passing through the Prague Main Station.
The newly opened station Prague-Zahradní Město will now stop the rapid train R17 from České Budějovice and Benešov.
We will expand PID to other areas.
We took the buses until Světlá nad Sázavou, Blatna u Jesenice, Staré Splavy and Turnov.
Buses will be added to Mladá Boleslav including lines that cross into Liberec and Hradec Králové regions.
When integration takes place, 77 lines will be cancelled, 37 new lines will be introduced, and 12 existing lines will be modified.
A new bus line, number 405, will be departing from Prague's Zličín station and going all the way to Žatec.
A new direct connection has been established between Prague and Kralovice u Rakovníka, replacing the cancelled train line S53.
You will travel to Rakovník from Prague over the weekend, when a new express bus line number 404 will depart.
Lines 400 and 410, which are traveling to Liberec County, have been added to the PID system.
They depart from the metro station Střížkov, not from the station Nádraží Holešovice.
The main line 400 goes through Mělník, Dubá and Česká Lípa to Nový Bor and some trains continue to Rumburk or Cvikov.
Route 410 goes through Mělník and Dubá to Doks, Mimoně and Jablonné v Podještědí.
Several central Bohemian railway lines have been closed or restricted, including Mochov, Dobříš, and Rožmitál pod Třemšínem.
All trains departing from Prague have been cancelled at 02:30.
Due to modernization of the railway, there will be long-term restrictions on the tracks Prague – Beroun, Prague – Lysá nad Labem and in the vicinity of Kolín.
Passengers are also waiting for changes at other locations.
Some discontinued railway lines are replaced by buses or the section of line 420 from Dobříš offers connections to Prague with PID tickets valid up to Milevsko.
Lines 540 to 543 on Nymburska have been changed and some bus routes in the border area of Central Bohemia and Hořovicka in the Plzeň Region have been modified.
Healthy lunch/dinner from the supermarket.
Hello, I work classically 9-5 with a 30-minute break and my only option to find food is to go next door to Billy or further down to Lidl.
Because I have no movement, I don't have the strength to exercise, so I have to eat healthily and diet a lot.
I never know what to buy and I always buy the maximum amount of pizza, yogurt, and apples.
What would you recommend I buy in the supermarket to stay healthy without the need for thermal processing?
Nobody is waiting for a snowfall like you, unfortunately.
It is necessary to see the trees.
Only the tip of the tree can be hidden by snow.
If the tree is damaged, it may be more susceptible to fungal diseases.
I understand that the reason they prohibit us from driving off-pavement is because it is one of the reasons, but it is one of them.
Acknowledgement of the relationship with Neptune: I never wanted this.
A Czech fish pond will not survive anything other than the revelation of the relationship between Daria Rolins and Pavel Nedved.
They have been together for years, the famous footballer even broke up with his girlfriend because of the singer.
Dara sent a lengthy message to her fans, in which she explained why she had been keeping her love for them a secret for such a long time.
Dara Rolins jokes, "Nobody exists in the Czech Republic or Slovakia who would be ashamed to admit that they caught a bear, i.e. a pardon, Nedved."
You have taken it, not me.
Three days are the focus of attention, though they are familiar to the public, bring no joy.
This is today.
We were not looking for each other, but we knew that it would eventually happen, and the singer continued to sing.
I don't know who is worse off.
If you don't care about them and just jump on them and open their lives in detail.
If someone would like to hear your opinion on whether you would like to get married or stay friends with your partner, or if you insist on everyone knowing your full list of former partners and being aware of your mistakes and failures.
You want to drink a beer, don't you?
Two people met up in Italy, where Rolins was traveling to prepare her new fashion collection.
Nedvěd has been working as the vice president of the football club Juventus for a long time.
They waited until now because they were waiting for the conclusion of Nedved's divorce.
They had been apart for three years, but they had only been reunited for three weeks.
We would like to thank those who are happy with us and wish to share their joy with us.
We are just ordinary people, with families, children, a past, and dreams.
We are not perfect, but I believe that we both have our hearts in the right place.
I love my new man the same way he loves me, and I stand by him in both good and bad, just as Rolins has.
Hello, other commenters have already said most of the important things, only confirming that the dorms are great to start with, my classmates usually get to know and become friends with each other during the first semester or two and then find shared apartments, which I think is the best option, since you know who you will be living with.
You usually don't advertise too far in advance, so you might not find what you're looking for, but taking a look at the offer won't hurt.
Only Vranovská and French Street are bad addresses, and some parts of Židice are a bit ghetto.
The area around Veveří is very student-friendly, Karlovo Pole is nice, and it's close to most of the faculties of the VUT (I don't know, exactly where you're supposed to get off).
I have never rented a car, but I was born and raised in Brno, so I may be able to help you with Brno if you are missing any information.
That is an example of completely normal thinking.
Because several doctors decided to move to Poland, it is actually okay that the state does not adequately fund some schools.
Study what you want and pay for it yourself or follow the state's rules and pay the state.
We cannot allow a private actor to take over education just because they get a few thousand crowns in subsidies, because then they will be able to teach whatever they want in schools.
That statement loses weight when written by a person who two days earlier expressed themselves in support of the boycott of the totalitarian state:
That someone going to an abortion is the same as someone voting against a statue being placed in the square?
You consulted directly with the person who was giving you the task.
I have experienced that (even long-time professionals) either approve of it with their eyes or write something like xxx *** or ... (according to convention) and add a note that it is unreadable.
It is quite readable in this case, so I would not recommend it.
I would have handled it somehow in a note according to how you were using the program.
You could look into symbolic databases and find the closest one.
Because it looks like you are drawing from some book, I would assume the author or printer simply created their own unique sign, which sits alongside the physical object.
It is not by chance that Silesia (Kingdom) is Odryan rather than Odryan?
Someone has already broken into this place.
Write a comment with ΦΙΛH.
Our presidency will focus on the following topics.
It is worse than having to bring translators with you.
The idea that someone would approve something simply because they didn't understand the text is amusing.
All important documents are scrutinized word by word, and having a basic knowledge of English is not enough, this is the job of lawyers.
In the European Union, there are hundreds of translators and interpreters working, English is more suitable for informal contacts, networking and establishing extra-ordinary relationships.
It is also interesting in English, after the UK's exit from the EU.
I am going to the ceiling.
I have been working there for three years and I am very happy.
I always leave work at 10 pm and never have any problems.
Only someone who has nearly died in life can say that it is a ghetto.
Most of the Roma population in Brno lives there, but the only thing they do is to block the pavement and park illegally wherever they can :D definitely not something you would want to do at night.
If you are looking for reasonably priced housing with good access to the center, I would go for it without hesitation.
There are now newly reconstructed or newly built objects there.
Felix Slováček (78) beat his wife and girlfriend with an axe in the garden!
Where do you spend Christmas?
Most people lit the first Advent candle on Saturday, Felix Slováček did not.
I don't have an advent wreath, so there was nothing to light.
I saw a wreath and Lucie definitely has one too, said the saxophonist, confirming Patra's words that she often visits.
He visits but does not live in their house on Vinohradek, where Dada remained alone after his departure.
Slováček does not know where he will be on Christmas Eve.
We recently met with Anička, Felix and their two nephews.
Felix Slováček and Lucie Gelemová: Together!
Felix Slováček and Lucie Gelemová: Together!
We were talking so much that Christmas didn't happen.
I don't know where I will be.
I always buy something for Daria and Lucia, maybe a perfume.
I am Felix, the one who came to the club Richman with the music video.
I am alone, but I do not feel lonely.
Slováček claims that he always manages to find someone with whom he can have fun, whether it's Luďka Sobotová's husband Adrian or singer Kamila Nyvltová.
He clearly expressed himself.
Are we allowed to bring soldiers and weapons?
We believe that someone will defend us and our location is so strategic that an attacker would have to be a complete idiot to try to take it.
Why should I have a bad argument, if you can explain it to me?
I don't know any other component that could be deployed in hospitals during a crisis.
There are not enough police officers and they cannot afford it, so firefighters and ambulances are the only option for such a high percentage of disabled people at this level.
Our army is capable of defending Ostrava just as much as the previous governments, not an army, which has been asking for new toys for too long.
Record-breaking cold in the Czech Republic.
It is important to change agricultural subsidies, the countryside should not be only a factory for producing food, says the journalist.
The Czech Republic is currently experiencing its worst drought in recent years.
According to scientists, snow has decreased in mountain and sub-mountainous areas, as well as places where drought has not yet been an issue.
The reason for the drought, which is prevalent in much of central Europe, is climate change.
The consequences of our actions strengthen the way we deal with the land.
What are you preparing for?
How can we help nature in difficult times?
I will always keep my skates sharpened, I know what to do in the game of hockey and I have tried various tactics (in Franchise Hockey Manager) as well.
If you are a hockey team from Russia or China, you can still lose by two goals even if you don't have to win the game.
That's really strange, but it's part of all sports, UEFA and "Italian actors" or motorsport F1, WRC, etc.
Controversy is everywhere.
If it had been the other way around, then it would always be the same, and that Czech Republic would usually lose to Russia, then it would be a classic "they lost" vs "we won".
The number of cases of COVID-19 in Russia has exceeded 10 million.
The Czech Republic recorded 9,080 cases of COVID-19 on December 11th.
5766 people are hospitalized.
34,451 people died in the Czech Republic, along with 74 more.
In the last 14 days, there have been 1967 reported cases in the Czech Republic, with 871 cases reported in the last week.
The number of payments in Russia on Sunday exceeded 10 million.
In the last 24 hours, 29,929 new cases of the virus were registered.
The lowest daily number from October 13th.
The total number of registered cases of COVID-19 in Russia is 10,016,896.
The number of deaths per day is 1132, which is the lowest daily death count since October.
Britain is facing an "unavoidable" large wave of infection, said Dr. Susan Hopkins, the main medical advisor for the British Health Security Office on Sunday in television.
It will be necessary to implement new quarantine measures.
People infected with the novel coronavirus are being hospitalized in Britain and Hopkins expects their number to increase.
No one has died yet, but there are hospitalizations about fourteen days after infection and death about three weeks after infection.
Keir Starmer, the leader of the British Labour Party, stated on Sunday that Boris Johnson probably violated the law by hosting a Christmas quiz in Downing Street during the lockdown period when Christmas parties were banned.
One minister of Johnson's government praised the quiz being held "virtually", through a computer.
Employees from Downing Street gathered around the computers.
Britain is calling for Johnson to be removed from the prime minister's position.
During the winter of 2020, when London was under strict lockdown and Christmas parties were banned, the Johnson government organized numerous meetings despite the lockdown.
The British public and media are furious that Johnson and his government are making a mockery of Brexit.
Paul Brand, editor of commercial television ITV for Britain: Two years ago, Boris Johnson won a decisive majority in the general elections.
The Conservative Party is arguing that he must be removed from his position as prime minister.
Impressive, how quickly events developed.
Do you want to save your skin?
Hungary is awaiting elections that could bring an end to the twelve-year rule of Viktor Orbán.
This sentence has a European meaning.
What are you waiting for, that the fairies will come?
I am learning.
Nobody voted freely, because there were not even two choices under Orbán.
Fidesz controls the media, changes the electoral boundaries to their advantage, and engages in various smaller or larger tricks.
The last one is: Everyone can choose where they want to in practice.
Fidesz is attempting to swing voters from decided districts into those where the outcome is uncertain and the opposition could potentially succeed.
You will never know, maybe they will come.
Do you think it will be the same as in 2014 and 2018?
The situation is significantly different.
It used to be about whether Fidesz would win, but now it's about how many seats they will have and whether they will have a constitutional majority.
There is a real chance that the united opposition could gain more votes and seats in the parliament.
Victor Orbán and his party have achieved great success.
Can you still play hard?
We have some indications that they are prepared to go beyond what they have done so far.
Recently, a recording of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán and one of the leaders of Fidesz, László Köver, was leaked, in which he claims that the opposition is a threat to national security.
These are signs of a new approach, which you are talking about?
That is one of those new things.
Everything begins with language.
I have been very often, since I was 14, my mother has no patience, I also don't, my grandfather has long, but then he gets extremely angry (only in relation to me).
I was very angry and upset to the point that I was shaking uncontrollably, so much so that I was lying on the ground convulsing and turning blue, which my parents probably thought twice about taking me to the doctor.
Sometimes I was teaching, sometimes it was more like they didn't know.
I often have the tendency to solve things violently, as I was very angry when I was younger, so I would bite my parents' hands to the point of drawing blood, just to avoid getting caught.
I cannot determine how much this is my explosiveness, but certainly education has its share in it.
I'm afraid I'll also lose my patience with the kids and have to find a way to deal with it.
I think having children is simply difficult and my parents didn't have the right approach at that moment, but out of frustration, on the other hand, every parent can make some mistakes that are not easy to undo, so I don't blame them.
I don't understand why he should be ashamed of himself.
The laws should be clear and unambiguous.
You are amazing, because you create laws in such a quality.
Were you concerned about the possibility of a payment failure?
Can you really count on the fact that people will want to buy your product and will be willing to pay for it?
Kocner's foolish world.
Why is Slovakia moving forward with the journalist Kuciak's case?
In Slovakia, the main trial of the four accused in the murder of Jan Kuciak and Martina Kušnírová begins.
The death of the investigative reporter and his partner changed Slovakia.
She exposed the civil society, but also uncovered the practices of accused businessman Marian Kočner and his connections to the top levels of Slovak politics and justice.
What will the fundamental change mean for Slovakia?
That is what journalists can do.
It is possible that this petition had much more media attention than the counter-petition of the deans of all medical faculties, which was released a day later.
The company jumped out of the window.
On Czech television, people were already dying from COVID-19 half a year ago.
The next government will end and the law on involving municipalities in the selection of storage places nowhere.
The proposal by Minister Karla Havlíček needs to be fundamentally reworked.
The government of Prime Minister Andrej Babiš has come to an end and the law, which was supposed to ensure the respect of interests of municipalities and their citizens when selecting and approving a deep geological repository for highly radioactive waste, still does not exist.
The Legislative Council interrupted the discussion of the proposal, which had been submitted to the government by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce after a long struggle.
This sentence translates to "However, it is not only in conflict with the affected communities united in the Platform against the deep repository, but also with the Union of Cities and Municipalities of the Czech Republic."
Local authorities expect a significant strengthening of their decision-making powers regarding waste storage, which was promised to them since 2011, when the first works on this legislation began and which is also required by the Czech Atomic Act and European Directive.
We expect the new government, in accordance with its coalition agreement, to rework the proposal in cooperation with the towns.
Minister Karel Havlíček's proposed law is criticized by towns in particular for its lack of involvement of towns and the public in the decision-making process regarding the selection of a location for a storage facility, which fails to respect the interests of towns and their citizens.
It can be effectively carried out only if local authorities or the public can influence whether the process will continue in a given location.
To obtain the consent of the affected communities before the commencement of specific proceedings.
The proposed plan almost completely excludes public participation and turns citizens of the towns into mere spectators at decision-making processes.
There is no system setting compensations for villages throughout the process of searching and selecting a location, its authorization and operation.
Leaders of towns have few opportunities to defend the interests of their citizens when looking for a storage place.
In some decision-making processes, people can submit their memories or appeal, but the office or minister, whose interest is to grant the permission, ultimately decides.
No retrospective effect on the performance of exploratory or construction works.
The request for decentralization, which the Platform advocates, is a principle commonly used in many democratic and developed countries, and definitely in those where they have already implemented a repository, such as Sweden or Finland.
Preparing a law is yet another failure of state administration, which hires external legal firms to do the job.
In this case, it is a contract with law firm HAVEL & PARTNERS s.r.o., which SÚRAO has signed with the lawyer Jan Zeman.
The total sum for this work according to the register of agreements is almost 4 million crowns.
Antonín Seknička, mayor of the village of Cejle and spokesperson for the Platform Against Deep Storage of Radioactive Waste said: The ministers of industry who shifted the balance of power between local authorities and state offices in the search for a deep storage site for highly radioactive waste have left it to the next government to make a more decisive turn.
We offer him/her and helping hand.
We would like to thank the Union of Cities and Municipalities for recognizing the importance of this issue and taking a stance on it in the same way as directly affected municipalities in certain locations.
The Platform for Nuclear Waste Storage brings together 51 members (35 towns and cities and 16 associations) with the aim of changing the state's approach to handling radioactive waste, which should not be limited to deep storage.
The platform advocates that the decision to select a location for potential storage should be based on the prior approval of affected municipalities.
John Goodman (69 years old) did not feel afraid: he lifted 90 kg.
Although he had no need to change his lifestyle for a long time, doctors eventually scared him.
He said, "If he doesn't stop, he will die."
He ate.
Goodman gradually lost 90 kilograms, which is half of his original weight of 180 kilograms, according to the newspaper The Sun.
He proudly attended the premiere of the animated series The Freak Brothers in Los Angeles.
The character of Roseanne is completely different from the one in the sitcom!
John advised his friends and family to encourage him to lose weight, as his large body was causing furniture to break.
He said in an interview with AARP in 2018, "I've been scratching my way to the top."
This time I wanted to do it slowly.
Study, practice.
Goodman said that his transformation is amazing.
It depends on what you want to use the word "boss" for.
If the text is aimed at gamers, I wouldn't translate it at all.
If it is about a formal text or a university-level one, I would try to describe or explain it in a more sophisticated way.
There are many different types of bosses.
Dark Souls has several bosses, each with their own unique challenges. A "boss" is something like a master / ruler of that level, and then there is a final boss...
In many games, there are hidden bosses who do not need to be defeated in order to finish the game or level, but are often much stronger than the standard bosses.
Are there any games like Half-Life, where the bosses are, but the player can interact with them directly?
There are no bosses.
It is impossible to translate "boss" into English, Czech, or any other language. However, interestingly, Catalan translates it as "final opponent".
The story or game is generally important, computer-controlled, the opponent is stronger than all previous ones and is guarding the completion of some level or task.
Peter from London is searching for something all over the world.
The Czech police have been alerted.
The British police are searching for Peter Srnce from December 3rd.
The Czech police have also become involved in the search.
A man from Hungary is looking for a woman from Uherské Hradiště from December 7th.
Skrz is helping the British police.
His friends last saw Peter Srnček on November 28th.
The British police are searching for her from December 3rd.
Interpol issued a yellow notice for her.
He is searching for the whole world.
The Czech police cooperates closely with the British police, confirmed police spokesperson Kateřina Rendlová.
We will share information about the case, she said.
The search for Peter has been reported on the police website as well.
She is 168 centimeters tall, curvy, and has brown eyes and long, equal-length blonde hair.
She had a journey from Hungary.
Petra worked as a nurse in one of the London hospitals.
Friends and colleagues are afraid of her, since such a disappearance is very unusual for her.
Harriet Harman, a local MP, has also become involved in the search for Peter.
Petra put up posters with her face on them.
We have great fears, she said at the Saturday press conference.
The British police apprehended one suspect.
It is not clear who Peter was with or what they had in common.
Pre-Christmas Czechoslovakia terrorizes Agent Tesla.
Data in October showed a gradual decrease in attack campaigns, but in the last month the attacks have become much more intense.
We recorded the campaign related to Agent Tesla on November 18th.
Attacks are targeted at the Czech Republic.
The strategy of attackers remains the same for now.
The attached file in the email may alert the user to the fact that it contains references to payments and financial transactions.
Last month, the word "faktura" was dangerous, this time it was marked as "Copy of the invoice for 11,2021...exe", said Martin Jirkal from Eset.
Spyware includes functions that can eavesdrop on internet browsers and other programs, such as Microsoft Outlook, Mozilla Thunderbird, or Yandex.
Malicious code actively searches for stored login credentials, which are then sent to the attackers.
The last strong campaign took place in the Czech Republic at the end of August and September and the activities of the attackers are again increasing towards the end of the year.
Formbook remained active in November.
In contrast to Agent Tesla, attackers in this case are not specifically targeting the Czech Republic and security experts in November caught more campaigns with a global reach.
In comparison to November dates, Formbook has slightly weakened, yet it still stands at nearly five times the detection rate.
Attacks occurred continuously throughout the month with increased activity on days 3, 10, and 15 November.
The most frequently encountered file extension was .exe, which was named REQUEST FOR SPECIFICATION.
The name of the account continues to appear.
The attachment in Czech can be very dangerous for a Czech user.
Significant decrease in activity and slowdown in security analytics for the Fareit program, which accounted for 1.6% of attacks and in the Czech Republic had no major offensive campaigns in the last months.
Today's vaccinated children do not need oxygen, because oxygen is for unvaccinated babies.
The tour of Prague was bigger than the media reports.
Based on the pictures of the parade and my experience as a demonstrator, I would guess that there were around 10,000 people in attendance.
People filled the embankment as well as the overpass.
It means that there are a lot of people.
A crowd of around four thousand people joined the protest spontaneously, accompanied by an unexpected number of passersby.
I believe something new is being born, writes Radek Mokry.
The dissatisfaction of several large groups or layers of the population led them to find a common language.
The small group of anti-vaxxers, antirouters, and other protesters were unable to fill or pay for the large procession.
Action speaks louder than words, reminding me of the Million Steps for Democracy movement.
Sometimes I have the feeling that they are renting the same podium and equipment.
It is difficult to say how this dissatisfaction could be alleviated, not only depends on the amount of money, but also whether the three-shot vaccine from Pfizer will cause side effects.
There will not be a left-wing nor a centrist movement, you will all sink together.
The vaccine will almost certainly become a boosted vaccine, since it is clear that we will have to wait half a year for each dose.
I am very glad that vaccines saved us.
Excellent work by scientists, for which humanity is entitled to be proud.
Bulgaria has a new prime minister who is announcing change.
