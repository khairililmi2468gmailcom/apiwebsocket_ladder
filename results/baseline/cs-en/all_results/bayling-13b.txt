The return of the Czech smelter is imminent.
Pavel Francouz was called up to the NHL
Czech goalie Pavel Francouz, who has been struggling in recent months with a difficult period in his career, is returning to the NHL.
The 31-year-old Pilsen native will be on the bench and could thus soon get into the game.
The former goalie from Litvínov, Plzeň and Russian Chelyabinsk suffered an injury in training for the NHL in October last year.
He played just over half a game against Vegas and hasn't been seen in the NHL since.
It happened in the moment the experienced goalkeeper was moving from one post to another.
Pavel Francouz will be sidelined for approximately three to four weeks with an injury to his lower body, the club from Denver announced at the beginning of October.
His return to the NHL line-up lasted just over two months.
On Sunday morning American time, he was recalled from the farm where he had caught four duels and showed his old form.
The VAT thus accounted for 94.5% of proceeds.
A product of the Plzen hockey youth system wants to finally prove that he belongs in the best league in the world.
He had calf problems in the last campaign and didn't play a single game in the shortened pandemic season.
In the NHL, "Francik" played 36 games, his save percentage is at 92.3%.
Charles gives Camilla a birthday present, William and Kate pose in Jordan
Britain's Prince William and his wife Kate have chosen a family photo taken during their trip to Jordan for their Christmas wish this year.
Prince Charles also shared his wish, using a photograph of his wife Camilla helping him to put on his robes.
The news was reported by the British news agency BBC on its internet pages.
The wishes are sent to friends, colleagues and foundations with which they collaborate.
The photography was taken somewhere in the desert landscape.
The Cambridge Countess was dressed in long summer khaki, as was Princess Charlotte.
Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, wore shorts and a polo shirt similar to Princes George and Louis.
Who took the photograph has not been revealed, and when exactly it was taken is not clear either.
The Royal Family have posed for their Christmas card photograph in front of a stack of logs in the grounds of their country estate in Norfolk.
A picture released as a Christmas message was also shared by heir to the throne Prince Charles and his wife Camilla.
Photographer Sam Hussein captured the moment in June at Ascot.
Charles, wearing a cylinder and a face veil, helps Camille put on her coloured veil to match her bright clothes.
According to efotbal.cz, Slavia have promised Berbr a million for the title, which Tvrdík denied.
Prague - In the current corruption case, it is reported that the criminalists worked on the assumption that the accused former vice-president of the Czech Football Association Roman Berbr had allegedly been promised a million crowns by Slavia Prague for the league title in the 2018/19 season.
The server efotbal.cz announced this with the fact that it had got hold of a part of the police files.
Chairman of the board of directors of the Vršovice club Jaroslav Tvrdík said that the red-whites did not tolerate any corrupt practices.
The server published a transcript of a police interview in which Slavia figure mainly through its former sports director Jan Nezmar, who left the club in the summer.
According to the indictment, the former powerful official of the red-white party was in regular contact both with Berbr and with the former sports director of the then second-league Vyšehrad, Roman Rogoz, who is also among the accused in the case.
Criminologists reportedly worked on the basis that Slavia had promised a financial reward for the title.
In 2019, the SK Slavia Prague team won the title in the first league.
The police body knew that Roman (Berbr) stood to receive a million-crown bribe from officials of SK Slavia Prague, the server quoted from the file.
According to criminologists, Berbr later met not only Nezmar but also the chairman of the Slavia board, Tvrdik.
It is not stated in the survey whether the police are still dealing with this information on the server.
Tvrdík rejected any corrupt practices.
In 2015-2017 we actively tried to change the situation in Czech football and offered an alternative to its development.
We have never tolerated illegal actions, we have not tried to influence referees in violation of the rules of fair play and we have not provided any financial compensation in this regard," Tvrdik said for Seznam News.
In retaliation, among other things, Nezmar unceremoniously insulted some former Slavia players and also denigrated his former boss Tvrdik.
The alleged manipulation of matches through referees sparked a police raid in mid-October at several locations, including the FA CR headquarters in Prague.
The person highest up in the scandal is Berbr, who no longer holds any football function.
In mid-January, just like former sports director of Vyšehrad Rogoz, he was released from custody.
Drones, tanks and BVPs are LARPing the Cold War.
The guns will be new, but of a worse type (gunners will have to load their weapons manually from an armoured cabin without cover).
Auta - Toyota Hi-Lux - are new and good
Wheel loaders and various armoured vehicles - on a decent level, furthermore, it has been successful in getting rid of Praga V3S even in specialised units.
Aircraft: combat-capable, but at the end of the lease, transport - very small with short range, but modern.
Drones - few and only small types without combat potential
Rakety - we do not have at all (but we produce and export)
PVO: medium - cold war era, outdated; short range - good, modern, relatively good number.
Such a story.
Honitbu is right next to the city.
There were beavers in the river, causing damage to crops, so I went to deal with them.
When I arrived, I saw that there was a fisherman on the other bank of the river.
I didn't want to run a brothel, so I sat quietly and typed and maybe he didn't notice me.
I thought he'd go, but just as I was thinking that a mouse ran out, of course.
I watched her get to within 40 metres of me before I decided to shoot.
The novice angler was almost eaten by a pike, so I called out to him that it was a perch.
Before I slipped out of bed I was fucked.
Tzn. I louka muže bejt pruser.
On the other hand, it is not a war, it would require a series of coincidences for something to happen, probably you would be seen through the thermal imaging camera, which everyone has today.
So at visible places, dear things should be given to no one and I would be well.
Vojtěch vs Hamáček
In vitro testing of respirators is significantly cheaper than the Ministry of Health
The state, responsible for the purchase and distribution of masks, gowns and respirators for professions closest to the coronavirus, has spent hundreds of millions of crowns on them in recent weeks.
Server iRozhlas compared purchases by individual ministries and found that during one day the amount for the respirator varied by hundreds of crowns.
Why have prices moved so dramatically?
How were the authorities behaving economically?
So why did they buy Dráž?
Lenka Kabrhelova is talking to the editor-in-chief of the server and radio iRozhlas, Dominika Kubisthova.
I respect soldiers and armies (I am not affected by the memories of the CSLA experienced by previous generations), but the Czech Republic cannot benefit from compulsory military service.
We don't have a big stock of techniques that can be taught, we don't have modern technology even for the current professionals, and in addition, modern technology is becoming increasingly complicated, so the abilities of the reserves will rapidly decrease over time.
In that modern conventional conflict, which side can you put in, it will be played very quickly, there will be no time for anyone to train again.
Ultimately, hookers/territorial defense is of great importance to countries such as Ukraine, where it is necessary to conduct mass guerrilla warfare and this is expressly stated as a deterrent to enemies.
In the territory of the Czech Republic, a war can only be waged in such a scale and intensity of conflict where guerrilla warfare will be irrelevant, and we do not have suitable geography for this.
We mainly do not have individual skills.
It's not the worst thing for ani.
The worst thing is that half of them play as if they had it.
I am an intelligent language assistant.
Of course they won't vote for him as an average taxpayer.
It is a frightening situation to "play without the ball" and I was shocked when I saw that our attacker managed to outplay one of the opponent's players.
First impressions
The Covid pandemic is slowing things down a bit, but experts are not expecting any major turnaround in the coming weeks.
Hospitalization rates for COVID-19, according to statistical models, will persist for some time and the pandemic equation will include, as is known, a new unknown: the omega variant, which is very probably spreading faster than the currently prevailing Delta.
It is not yet possible to say with absolute certainty whether it can cause more severe courses, to what extent vaccination or post-infectious immunity acquired during previous illnesses helps against it.
However, this week has also brought an unexpected phenomenon on the positive side: the possibility of treatment.
A new drug, antiviral drug molupiravir, has arrived in the Czech Republic, which reduces the risk of severe course of the illness and associated hospitalization by a third, and it is possible to treat it at home.
Soon he will also add the drug paxlovid from the Pfizer company, which claims an 85 percent success rate to date.
The first deliveries of molupiravir to Czechia have not only raised hopes of expanding the portfolio of tools useful in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic, but also highlighted how prepared the local administration is for the arrival of new drugs.
As mentioned, the first Czech patients will receive Merck's molupiravir.
The company ended up on the path as the first because the drug was developed long before the current pandemic with the aim of finding a cure for viral equine disease in South America.
This research often overlooks the fact that people in the West (Germany, Sweden etc.)
They are generally less open and do not openly express their views.
Therefore, Eastern Europeans, especially us Czechs, are used to say "as the crow flies".
You are conducting a survey where you ask people if they like Muslims.
In the Czech Republic the vast majority will tell you no, without hesitation.
In the West they will tell you how much they love migration, how everyone should help them and how we, the Czech, are a racist country.
I would vote for the AfD.
He is afraid of a culture of cancellation, saying it means the loss of his job and a media lynching.
In polls it looks good in the west, bad in the east.
But it will really tell us what people think.
In France, Le Pen and Zemmoura both have over 20%, according to a poll.
We know that the objects are three and completely identical.
Due to the rotation of units, soldiers do not have to learn where everything is again, so all objects on fur are the same.
One is the Atom Museum in Brdy and the other two are abandoned.
Sranda, that the USSR did not want to have nuclear warheads on its own territory, either for security or for the speed of deployment, given its western location.
These underground chambers (in each beech tree there are two) were used to store only the heads, not the entire rockets, as it is said.
If it was necessary to fit this weapon, a special unit arrived, which took the barrel and mounted it on some support structure.
Apart from that museum yew, the rest are in a sorry state.
In the second grade of primary school, we had a Gypsy classmate, and we were with him for four years.
He was a bit of a character, made some good tips, was sometimes a bit over the top, but he was our mascot.
Everyone knew him, he often went for a walk and wanted to explain something, he was rarely wrong, he walked regularly, he was devoted to sports with us, he did not steal sweets or mobile phones, he walked around in clean clothes.
He went to nature schools, did all sorts of monkey business, but he was happy, never any trouble.
In the eighth or ninth grade, the siblings, along with gypsies of the same age, went to different classes.
Shortly after that, the teacher was attacked; the police solved something there often; they threatened and endangered other students.
I personally sometimes sell something on an advertisement (old things, something I do not need) and I have already sold to Gypsies many times, they always have money, they did not try to cheat on the price, communication is calm.
I once sold a car that way, the boy called after a month that he had already paid for it.
I myself say that I am not a racist, it does not matter to me whether someone is white, black, yellow, blue or otherwise, as long as they behave in a decent society (work, function, do not beat women, just normal behavior).
If someone comes, shakes hands, looks for flats and houses, makes a mess around himself, it will be one how has a color, but it will disgust me.
I have no problem with African migrants, if they integrate, start businesses, work, learn languages (not necessarily English, at least), and respect our culture.
If they believe in God, it's fine as long as they respect my traditions and culture, I'll be there too.
Young woman dies in Prachatice road crash
The young woman suffered serious, life-threatening injuries and despite resuscitation efforts she died at the scene, said the spokesperson of the South Bohemian healthcare rescue service, Zuzana Fajtlova.
The accident was probably caused by a driver who took the girl.
An 18-year-old driver of a Peugeot vehicle was likely driving in the direction from the village of Žíchovec to the town of Bavorov and for as yet unknown reasons, the vehicle went into a bend in the opposite direction.
After the collision, the Peugeot vehicle ended up on the roof of the road, outside the lane of traffic, described police spokesperson Stepanka Schwarzova.
The young Peugeot driver suffered serious injuries in the accident.
It was a multi-fracture and he remained pinned in the vehicle.
After the rescue he had to be given urgent pre-hospital care and was transported by helicopter to a hospital in Czech Budějovice, said rescuer Fajtlová.
It added that the man in the second vehicle suffered minor chest injuries and was taken to hospital.
New rules apply to packages from non-EU countries, but customers often fail to provide information about them
Lukáš Neuheisl orders from abroad several times a month.
It mainly charges collector cards.
They are usually in the tens of dollars, say from ten dollars upwards where it is worthwhile importing, especially from Japan where postage is often free, the collector says.
Since October, he has been charging a small surcharge for orders, and will now have to add VAT and hand over details to customs control.
He'll get an email telling him that customs are expecting a parcel.
It is enough to fill in the details of the consignment, and if the DPH did not include the trader in the sale, the customs office will calculate the total amount for the consignment and for transportation.
If the recipient does not arrange customs clearance themselves, the forwarder's fee must be added to the total amount.
According to Lukas Neuheisel, though, the whole process is not complicated.
Insert one or two erasure clauses, add two annexes and I'm done.
For me it's mostly a question of five minutes, says Neuheisl.
But not all deliveries go smoothly.
Due to the new customs regulations, the daily number of incoming foreign mail in Prague has decreased from 60,000 to 15,000.
According to the Czech Post, the problem is also that people do not react to calls for the submission of information necessary to complete customs proceedings.
Currently there are 300,000 items of international mail that we have to process.
If people filled in all the information that is needed and filled it in in good time, we'd be about half way there, says spokesman Matyáš Vitík of Czech Post.
Inflation solution
Specifically, how would you design a solution to the current inflation?
We currently have 9.9% inflation and it is expected to rise further.
What should have been done, according to you, to slow down or compensate for this growth?
We have seen a decrease in VAT on food and PHM in Poland, is this the way for you?
What do you think will happen, what is inevitable with where it is going?
Prices are rising faster than wages, according to me it is inevitable that people will not be able to afford basic things, especially energy.
How much did you get (who is the employee)?
They added 2% in gross, which is an insult, but fortunately I have similar income from self-employment which I operate alongside my employment.
Surely there is someone capable of explaining why proven violent offenders are being sent behind bars for just six months?
I just can't understand how the court could only sentence such an animal to six months, just so it can do it again as soon as it gets out.
6 months is nothing in comparison to the fact that his/her victim will have trauma for several years, negatively affecting his/her sexual relationships and overall relationships.
So, the victim of rape will never have to remember it.
Is this intended to prevent potential future reports of rape of the victim?
Man "blew up" his girlfriend from Kostomlat
The man from the Tomb unwittingly helped the guardians ensure his nationally sought-after girlfriend from Kostomlat, who had been issued a warrant for her arrest.
He himself called for that.
He went around that though.
He first approached the group and concocted a story that he had been mugged.
Guards rushed to the scene after receiving a call on the emergency line but were stunned when the alleged "victim" told them he had made the whole thing up to get them to come to the scene.
In fact, he only wanted to ask the officers for advice on how to make a statement to the Czech Police.
When the identity of the man and his girlfriend were checked, the guards discovered that the woman was a person wanted throughout the country and a warrant for her arrest had been issued.
This is why the Czech Republic is dealing with the case.
Straightforward question for people here, do you consider our land to be Slavic?
I am personally of the opinion that Slavs are no longer an ethnicity or culture, but I would be interested in your opinion.
Of course I agree with Jinak that it's a shame Churchill failed to secure the liberation of Prague for the USA :')
Of course I don't deny that we have a Slavic language.
I don't know, it's quite a question whether a rational person can believe something at all without evidence just because it might be beneficial.
I would not consider that a genuine case.
I cannot agree with Pascal here; by some estimates, there are around 100,000 different religions in the world.
Which god or gods should a man choose?
I would say that it is quite likely that at least one of those thousands of religions has a god who will kick your ass if you believe in another god.
And in the tenth commandment it stands that there is no other god but Jahveh.
Therefore, in such a case, it would be more rational to avoid believing in any god than to risk choosing the wrong one from thousands of gods and ending up in hell or some similar place.
Another: Voluntary training with subsequent enlistment into the reserve.
The Swiss model is similar.
10 months of training (in different specializations, 10 months for one) and under the command of professional instructors with practical experience.
If a person leads well, they can get a professional offer.
Such a thing would suit all the components of the Czech Republic.
Dalo by se to dělat ve spolupráci s Univerzitou Obrany.
We can talk like this: Cooperation between the educational sector and industry is constant, companies are fishing in schools, and there is some kind of cross-over, when workforce migrates from educational institutions to work.
Not only during adolescence, but this process goes on constantly, we are constantly learning something new, moving from one field to another, etc.
Similar cross-over should work between civilian and military sectors.
I also see it as a way of building a relationship between the citizen and the army, that is, an institution that guarantees that it will never be invaded by Russians, Germans or even Mongolian invaders.
I find it amusing how you view NATO as a carved stone, we have allies and they will defend us in case of aggression.
Excuse me.
Just one election in the USA which bends their budget and the whole NATO goes to shit.
The English translation for this sentence is: "The Anglo-Saxons will exchange us for Russian dirt, the Germans will exchange us for Russian gas, and the Poles have already demonstrated that all they need to do is show their backsides and they will take what they want."
The only thing that has consistently functioned as a guarantee of independence is an armed population capable of mastering the military technology of their time.
Today, every teenager can pilot a remote-controlled device - so what's the problem?
We don't need border fortifications, that's today's fashion, but for a teenager with a remote-controlled device it's a good idea.
How to survive a cardboard tsunami
Are you going to give gifts under the Christmas tree and suddenly find your home swarming with crabs and fillers?
This "waste" is being used by e-shops, which lack packaging materials.
A map of stores that will take back your used cartons has been drawn up.
Not just for Christmas
All packaging materials are designed to withstand repeated manipulation.
It is a mistake to deal with them as if they were one-time rubbish.
Kdokoliv may, by agreement, deliver cardboard boxes, plastic or paper packaging to the connected trade (the map of the KAMsNIM.cz project contains almost 150 of them).
This will help small companies, reduce the amount of waste generated and also avoid the overcrowded blue containers.
Solo traders are welcoming packaging, which is currently in short supply on the market and is also a way of saving money, as cardboard packaging has become 50% more expensive over the past period.
In the eyes of ecologically-minded customers, I am thus strengthening my brand.
One such company is TIERRA VERDE, a manufacturer of ecological drugs and cosmetics.
Krabice and filler material are transported by individuals to Popůvky near Brno, but we also hear from companies with which we have regular deliveries of cardboard boxes.
We will use this for packing orders in our e-shop.
Thanks to individuals and companies, we are creating a more considerate world.
Our wish is to preserve nature's sources and beauty for future generations, says Petra Lopušníková from Tierry.
The www.KAMsNIM.cz application, however, shows not only collection points for packaging materials.
It serves as a search engine if you need to get rid of anything (take away the sorted waste from your household, where to deposit old medicines, tires, used electrical appliances, batteries, lamps, large waste etc.).
This means that all waste will end up in the right place, and items that can be reused will find their second home.
The map of the project thus contains more than 100,000 such places.
Gradually, collection courts, re-use centres, textile containers, food banks, charity shops, SWAPs and other places which help to find a use for things which would otherwise be waste, are popping up in it, Miroslav Kubásek, one of the authors of the application from the Czech association Ukliďme Česko, adds.
Rather, I fear that in today's times, technology is so simple and intuitive that children who use computers or phones to play games do not learn basic computer skills.
Recently there has been a problem (mainly in English articles) that students at universities do not understand the principles of the components of a computer.
Because apps like Google Photos or Apple Photos or even mobile phones in general just hide the underlying file system structure with its components and everything is presented on one screen in the app.
It's fine to use techniques since childhood, but above all, learn something.
Rewriting history, seriously
Emmanuel Macron presented the priorities of the French EU Presidency - which begins in January - and it was impressive.
Speaking for an hour, during which he revealed the logo of the presidency, Macron called for the protection of Europeans - in work, on the streets - and mentioned so many initiatives that it would be impossible to list them all in half a year.
But the French politicians like it, and the voters like it too.
Macron supporters who advocate a shift between right and left agree on little, but yes, in Europe.
In France, there will be new presidential elections in November.
The electoral calendar has influenced the very priorities.
The French leader among other things mentioned that historians should write "one history of Europe" and France is ready to provide conditions for such work by historians.
A number of commentators immediately criticised Macron's pro-European propaganda and his rewriting of history.
In fact, it is an attempt to rewrite history in order to protect it.
Far-right French presidential candidate Eric Zemmour is touring France with a message that the Vichy regime that collaborated with Hitler during World War II was not so bad and is having a big impact on the French.
Let's take Macron's idea seriously and don't ignore what's happening in France.
Nebyla by zapotřebí?
In European countries, students are taught history as a story of us versus them, never as a story of the whole.
Spaniards, Frenchmen and Czechs will learn who beat whom in which battle.
If they don't have an enlightened dean, they won't know the wider context of the event.
The film of the year is "Quo Vadis, Aida?"
Czech "mice" did not win.
The story, which returns to the Srebrenica massacre of 1995, also won awards for direction and best actress Jasna Duricic.
It was in the top positions of the viewers' chart at this year's Karlovy Vary International Film Festival.
The best actor in Berlin was Anthony Hopkins for Father.
I am not very young, not very healthy/fit and not vaccinated.

Prose texts that follow on from the preceding similar collection by Petříček Sellier & Petříček Bellot.
Another portion of observing the world and describing everyday things with an extraordinary poetic sensitivity, depth and atmosphere.
In his second novel, the photographer Šesták attempted to capture the essence of the small town and Czech society.
A narrative of a return to roots which turns out to be just a desired illusion.
A bohemist and comparatist transports a fairytale about the Red Cabbage into the setting of a contemporary village.
Her performance brutally overcomes the folk version and graduates into a horror of emotional emptiness.
This means that the road back to instincts is shorter than man is ready to admit
In his penultimate novel, the author tells a less sentimental story of return from emigration than we have become used to listening to.
Those who stayed and those who left, know too little about each other to make common life possible.
Trains will begin to run according to the new timetable, and in some places, the transport company will change
Trains will begin to run on the railways according to the new timetable from Sunday.
The biggest change is the replacement of operators on some lines, for example between Ústí nad Labem and Kolín, where instead of Czech Railways RegioJet will begin operating.
In the majority of cases, the times of departure and/or their routes are merely being changed.
There will also be dozens of new trains.
Transport companies started selling tickets for this autumn already.
In the new timetable, Czech Railways plan to provide an average of 6,783 personal transport services a day, of which an average of 478 long-distance trains a day.
Trains will travel approximately 118 million kilometers under the new timetable.
In addition to domestic connections, the trains will also run to Germany, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Austria and Switzerland within the new timetable.
The company is introducing dozens of new trains in conjunction with the new timetable.
The main novelty will be InterJet trains, which will run on lines from Prague to Cheb.
The operator will also run new trains in northern Moravia and in western Bohemia.
The carrier will also traditionally raise fares from next year by an average of 3.2 percent.
Railways take inflation into account when setting their fares annually.
The biggest change in the timetable for the RegioJet line is the introduction of the R23 link between Ústí nad Labem, Mělník, Nymburk and Kolín.
The carrier will replace Czech Railways here after winning the transport ministry competition.
RegioJet will put a total of 16 trains on the line, eight in each direction.
Further changes will affect long-distance trains between Prague and Brno, which will also call at the stations of Havlíčkův Brod, Žďár nad Sázavou and Kolín from Sunday.
Leo Express will keep 16 of its services, two return services to Slovakia and also weekend services to Krakow.
According to spokesman Emil Sedlřík, the carrier is also trying to maintain as similar as possible journey times for its long-distance trains despite the planned track works.
Services on the Arriva trains and those of other operators are not expected to be significantly affected.
The operator will also change in some regional lines.
Changes are in store for travellers, for example in the Czech town of Česká Lípa, where trains from Mladá Boleslav via Česká Lípa to Rumburk will instead of Czech Railways be operated by Trilex, a German company, Die Länderbahn.
Travellers will also be able to use through tickets on the railway in the second year.
As with Czech Railways, its price went up by 3.2 percent in inflation.
I must object.
Are we perhaps learning to see things from the other side?
Everywhere we hear how much they had to fight for their rights, how they were oppressed and had to give in, how they died.
In my life I have not heard teaching from the perspective of the slave owner or from that period, nobody defends that, just condemns it.
No one denies in schools that blacks often sold each other into slavery and that they were often the worst slave masters.
Nobody in school taught us that colonizers often bought land from the Indians, they just told us how brutally we, the Europeans, killed them, while they had been killing each other for a long time.
I have also spent some time in the USA, right at the schools, both in the northern schools, as well as in southern ones.
I did not mean to suggest that someone was deliberately silencing facts, but I had heard before that it was happening and I think it is a problem, I do not deny it (perhaps in Japan war crimes from WW2 are quite taboo).
My point was rather that history is not black and white and that we have a tendency to view it through today's eyes without understanding.
History does not interest us, it just is, and I think it is a fatal error to condemn without looking at the matter from the perspective of that time.
On the other hand, we should learn from it and never repeat it.
Nevertheless, while in those southern states, yes, the Confederate flag and famous slave owners are quite popular, on the other hand, they also had some good achievements and it seems absurd to me to reject them.
Moreover, Sever was not much better, as today many people idealise it.
Plenty of people also forget that not all southerners were slave owners and plenty of things were done to thwart them.
I would not equal that with the Russians, they deliberately omit some facts, lie and manipulate, in addition, our view of them does not exist (on YT there was a video from television, where someone started talking about our legionnaires and 1968).
What I found ridiculous when I was at US schools was the rise of marxism and the idealization of communism, something that never happened in their country.
I got the impression that at some universities it was shocking, that those students were so radicalised and that those schools were so supportive of that.
When I imagine these people will one day be much older, I am somewhat sad that it could be the voice of the majority, because it is among the young and in the ruling elite.
I think that feminism has already gone too far, that it has already achieved what it set out to achieve, and that it has been radicalised.
Nowadays, those who call themselves feminists are those who have nothing to do with it and ignore basic biological facts, just like other groups such as LGBT, which leads to radicalisation, even on the opposite side, when it often leads to resistance to quite reasonable things.
And the more radical someone is, the more you hear of them.
At any rate, I have not come across anyone condemning me for colonialism or slavery.
I met with bad geography, but it was mutual :D
So not because I don't like it, but because it is completely meaningless according to me.
I would be proud of something if I couldn't do it myself?
Moreover, I consider the concept of nationality as unnecessary from the perspective of any personal identity.
If something connects us with people, views of the world and shared experiences, not where we were born.
I am not a believer, but from what I know, you can say this: we have two Greek Catholic parishes, one Ukrainian and the other Slovak.
This Slovak priest is a great guy, he preaches more about theology than politics, but always manages to slip in some nonsense about coronavirus, making everyone feel embarrassed.
Here, of course, is the Czechoslovak Husit Church.
Officially they are Protestants, but in fact they were born out of Catholic modernism and are in fact Catholic without the Pope.
I know many people who are Catholics but go to Protestant services because it is similar theologically but the members are mostly more liberal.
They have a beautiful and historically valuable Functionalist church on Botanic Street.
The Church of St. Michael on Dominican Square belongs to the Dominicans; indeed, every Sunday at 3 p.m. they celebrate a mass in Latin, just as it was done before Vatican II.
Plamínek from Bethlehem is in the Czech Republic, scouts took him from Austria
The nativity scene in Bethlehem, where according to Christian tradition Jesus Christ was born, is in the Czech Republic.
They did not go to Vienna due to the corona virus pandemic, but this time they were picked up at the Reintal - Breclav border crossing by their Austrian colleagues.
It was also taken by loners.
The Bethlehem lights are a beautiful Christmas tradition that we always take part in with the troop, we are really looking forward to it.
I am honoured that I was chosen, said scout Amália Budíková to the present journalists.
The handover took place on the Mikulov-Drasenhofen border crossing, i.e. on the border bridge, and now on the Reintal-Břeclav border crossing at the car park.
But usually scouts go to Vienna by train for it.
Nothing changes in the distribution of flames across the Czech Republic.
The scouts traditionally travelled to Brno by train first, where they handed it over to the bishop of the diocese, Vojtěch Cikrle.
The subsequent transport of the light will be ensured by the scout couriers on Saturday 18 December, who will travel by selected fast trains and personal trains.
The light will then be taken by local scouts or volunteers at the stations, who will then spread the flame across the Czech Republic, and even to places where trains do not go.
This year I had to make sure that the scouts complied with the valid measures against the spread of coronavirus.
It is happening in a similar way to last year.
We are giving our recommendation to the courier teams and also to the organizers of local events that they should of course wear masks, try to keep a distance, avoid singing with colleagues, just act in such a way as to make it as safe as possible, said the spokesperson for the Bethlehem Light event, Zuzana Hrbkova.
The tradition of Bethlehem lights, which travels around Europe, has its roots in 1986 in Austria.
The aim is to spread the idea of the flame, friendship and peace at the same time.
The Bethlehem light is a symbol of hope for believers, a light that surpasses the darkness.
In the Czech Republic, scouts have been taking care of its spread for more than 30 years.
The action is supported by dozens of volunteers; the flame is also a symbol of selflessness and human solidarity.
All the information, including a list of places where people can come for the lighting, can be found on the website www.betlemskesvetlo.cz.
I do not have economic education, so I do not know the basics of economics that would confirm that subsidies are a cancer in the economy, but I do not think that subsidies as a whole would be a problem.
The development of infrastructure, ecology (such as water retention), healthcare and education will properly utilize these funds, but I do not understand why these funds are being allocated to agriculture, industry and overall businesses.
As mentioned - unnecessary products are produced and this undermines the free market and "the natural life of the company".
I work in a factory where there are million posters on the corridors "XY financed/co-financed by project XY" and such a company is just artificially kept alive.
This is not support for the company that gives jobs to x people, this is the development of the company that holds on to it and takes away orders/employees from firms that could grow and be more productive after its demise.
Total agreement, it is terrible.
Sometimes even people born in the internet age fall for some trick or trap - especially advertising.
I myself think that online adverts don't influence me, but then again I notice that they do - it's so intrusive that a person can't help but be affected by it.
For this reason, I support radical voices in the European Parliament that currently want to impose a complete ban on programmatic advertising...
It is all nonsense, in the words of a classic - I would ban you from the internet.
Yes, I think that this virus has its roots in (but mainly in point 1):
1. "I will not believe something just because most people do and it makes sense, I am not a sheep, but I would rather believe something that is less likely, it doesn't make much sense, but it is important to have my own original opinion about which I will insist is critical thinking."
2. "of course I don't believe everything the media say"
3. "I do not believe politicians"
Television is broadcasting the trend of Christmas films, with two hundred of them having their premieres this year
Los Angeles - TV channels and streaming platforms in the United States and other English-speaking countries have fallen into the trend of Christmas films and this year will show their viewers a record more than 200.
This was calculated by the operator of the film database IMDb.
The genre of Christmas family and romantic films has been popular with the public in recent years and has significantly increased viewing figures, which is why these films are being made more and more.
Four times as many Christmas films were made in 2014 as in 2011 and twice as many as five years ago.
The IMDb database, however, only includes films with the word Christmas in the title, so the number of festive films is much higher.
Christmas movies have always existed.
In the Czech Republic, this period is associated above all with fairy tales. Globally, films such as Home Alone, Love on the Clouds or the classic Christmas story The Life is Wonderful from 1946 are also popular.
But the proper boom in festive snaps only really got under way in 2009, when US cable network Hallmark introduced a special series of films, says the BBC.
Her advent calendar project called Countdown to Christmas (Odpočítávání do Vánoc) back then contained four films and was very successful.
This station began entertaining its viewers on Christmas on October 22 and will show a total of 42 Christmas-themed films.
Competitor Lifetime is also getting in on the act, with 35 new Christmas movies this year alone, and popular streaming platforms such as Netflix are also contributing to the overall total.
In this enchanted period of the story, it doesn't really matter, it's all about the mistletoe and the snowglobe, author Brandon Gray, who penned a book on Christmas movies called I'll Be Home for Christmas Movies, said with a chuckle.
It's an escape and a way to feel some calm in the middle of all the holiday madness and insanity of the world we've been living in for the past few years, Gray added.
According to him, for example, the Hallmark television channel uses the same recipe for its films, which is uniform, but successful.
There are two people who fall in love with each other, but then about half an hour before the end of something, some misunderstanding occurs, but it is resolved successfully and the two of them kiss.
It's like that all over again, and as long as all the films look the same and have the same atmosphere, people will follow one after the other, says Gray.
Mazepin had a positive COVID-19 test and will not take part in the final F1 race.
Only nineteen drivers will take part in the Grand Prix of Abu Dhabi in the formula 1.
Nikita Mazepin will miss the last race of the season with a positive COVID-19 test.
The Haas team will only run one car.
In the final race of the season he was attacking for a better placing from 20th on the grid.
However, Russian driver Nikita Mazepin from the Haas stable will not take part in the Grand Prix in Abu Dhabi.
He had been tested for Covid-19 positively.
Only nineteen cars will appear on the starting grid, with the last-place starter Mick Schumacher, a teammate of Mazepin, and the first, Max Verstappen, who will compete with Lewis Hamilton in a direct battle for the title.
Mazepin was said by the Haas stable to be in pretty good shape and not showing any signs of it.
Nikita is physically fine because he was asymptomatic.
It is now in isolation and will be governed by the relevant public health authorities, with safety being the top priority for all parties involved," it said in a statement on formula1.com.
Haas will not and cannot send a replacement driver.
Any replacement rider would thus have to take a qualification or compete in another part of the weekend.
The first case of COVID-19 does not concern an athlete.
At the start of the just-ending season, Covid-19 affected Kimi Räikkönen, while Sergio Pérez and Lewis Hamilton were tested positively.
So they can do that as well.

In terms of the law, Covid is a listable communicable disease.
So in the same group as HIV, flu, jaundice or typhoid.
Section 152 - Spread of Infectious Human Diseases
Whoever intentionally causes or increases the risk of transmitting or spreading an infectious disease among people will be punished by imprisonment for six months to three years, a ban on activities, or the confiscation of property.
The perpetrator will be sentenced to between two and eight years in prison,
c) if he violates such an obligation arising from his employment, profession, position or function or imposed on him according to the law.
d) if such action would cause serious harm to health.
The perpetrator will be sentenced to a term of three to ten years if the act specified in paragraph 1 causes heavy harm to the health of at least two persons or results in death.
The perpetrator will be punished by imprisonment for five to twelve years if the act specified in paragraph 1 causes the death of at least two persons.

Mutation Omega spreading in Moravian South?
Hygiena is investigating another case of a child from Adamov.
There is currently another suspicion of this variant in another child from Adamov, from the preparatory class.
There is no direct contact with previous cases from primary school in Adamov," Ciupek said.
Six cases were reported in the region in the past week.
We are still waiting for the official confirmation of the variant in our six cases - this is being done by the National Reference Laboratory for rubella and CMV viruses at the State Health Institute in Prague, the director said.
Supplemented that it concerned two healthcare assistants from one department of the University Hospital in Brno and two children of one of them, further two primary school pupils aged 11 from the Adamov elementary school.
There is no connection between the cases from Brno and Adamov.
Three of them have mild symptoms, according to the director, and four of them are asymptomatic.
No one with suspicions of Omega travelled abroad
None of those mentioned travelled abroad, nor did anyone from their families, and there was no contact with anyone who was staying abroad.
There is no connection with the championships in water polo for anyone of those mentioned, stated Ciupek.
Head of hygiene Pavla Svrčinová previously said that an international tournament in water polo, which took place in Brno a number of weeks ago, is being investigated.
Players from the South African Republic and one Belgian player fell ill on it.
California to restrict gun sales
It wants to follow the example of Texas in banning abortions.
California Gov. Gavin Newsom announced Saturday a plan to ban the sale and production of some weapons in the most populous U.S. state using a legal mechanism similar to one used by Texas in its controversial fetal heartbeat bill.
People would have a right to compensation in any lawsuit brought against anyone who manufactures or sells assault weapons and homemade firearms in California.
The Newsom announcement was in response to Friday's ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court allowing Texas to continue enforcing a nearly 50-year-old precedent that established a nationwide right to abortion up until the 24th week of pregnancy.
However, the court did not rule on the constitutionality of the entire law, but rather on a technical issue arising from the innovative structure of the measure.
The legal challenge in this case was made public, thus preventing Texas Republicans from suing him the normal way.
I am heartened by yesterday's (Wednesday's) ruling by the Supreme Court of the United States allowing Texas to continue its ban on most abortion services and largely upholding Texas' effort to protect its law, the California governor said.
If states can now block review of their laws from federal courts, California will use that authority to protect human life, Newsom said.
His subordinates were reportedly instructed to work with state parliaments and the minister of justice to introduce enabling legislation that would allow attorneys general to seek bans on assault weapons and so-called ghost guns.
They are known as homemade weapons, not serialized and intended to circumvent regulations.
Newsom wants "private citizens" to have the right to demand compensation of at least $10,000 (around 220,000 crowns) and court costs from anyone who manufactures, distributes or sells assault weapons or parts to make them in California.
If the most effective way to keep these horrible weapons out of our streets is to threaten lawsuits, then that's exactly what we should do, the California governor said.
The AP reported that California had banned the manufacture and sale of some military-style weapons for nearly a decade but a federal judge in June blocked the state's ban as unconstitutional.
If the state were truly to reinstate the death penalty using a Texas template, it would confirm the words of the Supreme Court's liberal Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who in a dissenting opinion warned of the expanding of the death penalty to other states.
However, the Supreme Court did not grant complete immunity to the Texas abortion restrictions, allowing abortion clinics to continue to sue the state over the measure.
Every emergency vaccination campaign has a public testing phase, during which it is gradually determined how the vaccination scheme will look like and the vaccines themselves are also improved on the basis of results.
From Israel, a large study on the effects of 4 doses is already underway.
According to those studies, in most patients, antibodies go up as much as fivefold, and that is a well-known long-term effect.
Like every other vaccine, it will have its own vaccination schedule, just one that is yet to be determined.
Another fact is that a new vaccine based on an inactivated virus is expected to be launched onto the market shortly, which according to the manufacturer's specifications promises up to 10 times greater efficacy.

Poland has threatened to withhold payments to the EU budget
According to Ziobra, the European Commission acted in contravention of the law if it were to use the new powers and suspend payments to Poland due to the dispute about the rule of law.
The Commission has already postponed the approval of the Polish plan to withdraw 3.6 billion euros from the EU fund to revive the economy affected by the pandemic of covid-19.
Under pressure from the European Parliament, it should go further and use the mechanism allowing the recovery of EU funding from countries that are in breach of the principles of the rule of law.
Poland should respond to this blackmail from the EU by vetoing all issues which require unanimity, said Ziobro, head of the small Solidarity Poland party, whose votes the current government would lack for a slim majority in parliament without them.
Poland should also take into account its commitments under the EU energy and climate policy, which leads to a drastic increase in energy prices, Ziobro added.
If the case continues, Poland will demand that it stop its contributions to the EU.
This is due to the fact that the EU is unlawfully denying us access to funds from the common budget, to which we also contribute, added the Polish minister.
His party's stance on access to the EU is more radical than the ruling party of Law and Justice.
According to the European Commission, the changes made to the Polish justice system during Ziobro's tenure threaten its independence and subordinate it to politicians.
According to Ziobro, Brussels is putting "impossible conditions, because its goal is not the rule of law, but a change of government in Poland."
Warsaw is facing a "political dictatorship imposed by blackmail and an attempt to overturn the democratic decisions of several million Poles," Ziobro also said.
He said that Poland should be a member of such an EU, which is based on partnership of sovereign states, and not on the government of the strongest and Brussels bureaucracy, which is not under democratic control.
He said his party would never agree to such concessions to Brussels that would undermine Poland's sovereignty.
We will never agree to Poland being a colony, he said.
And acknowledge that... With us in the Parliament we have one cheese in four different places.
I was looking for other things, I met yogurt so many times, I just needed cheese, ham, after ten minutes I gave up at the dairy counter and asked for help.
They did, it is true, have all the chosen, less common and special cheeses in that narrow sector, but it was between the vegetables and the no-lactose zone...
If there is no escape, I won't even go to any markets or shops, just actions, the golden shop on the square, there they don't have such a selection, but mostly they have everything in abundance and in some order, so that in ten minutes I'm done.
Don't let your left hand know what your right hand is doing.
It's all the same to me.
For two years I have been watching how it deals with data like with dirt, the majority of the anti-vaccine are just a little more outside the norm than the majority of the pro-vaccine.
Although rational discussion is taking place at a professional level, only extremist views are being presented to the public.
Constantly from wall to wall.
Binary thinking: vaccines will save us, vaccines are worthless.
Everything forbidden, everything allowed.
Sweet cakes instead of robust analysis.
Comparing apples with pears.
That is the way it is with them and that is the way it is with us.
And no one deals with the fact that the method of data collection is different in those two states.
Fuj, what a relief.
Sorry for the intrusion and wish you all a nice day.
I was beaten with a strap in childhood.
It was never about the stamps, it was mostly that I repeatedly refused to listen and irritated (read instead of going to sleep, doing the dishes, etc.).
At the same time, I was never punished without being forewarned, my mother always threatened me first, saying that if I did it again, I'd get a beating (sometimes, after "nagging" the cook, she would just bring and place the food in front of me so that I could see it).
Only then, when I categorically refused to listen, did I get a few slaps around the face (across my clothing).
I personally believe that physical punishment (in moderation and measure) can be beneficial because children respond much more to actions than words.
I think it is important according to me that part with the warning, because it gives the child the choice whether or not to listen and whether or not to improve and avoid the punishment.
In the end, I mostly needed a warning to start listening.
Defense of the system
When asked by a journalist in 1999 what the Czech Constitution meant to him – whether it was a sacred document, to which an oath was sworn and which was taught in schools from an early age, or on the other hand an agreement which could be amended in case of need – the distinguished Czech lawyer and constitutional judge Vojtech Cepl unequivocally opted for the former.
Once we agreed on democratic rules for our life within the constitution, which define who we are as a state and its citizens, and how we should deal with changes.
Imagine: some peoples have their rules even gladly.
That's how much Czechs like dumplings with pork and sauerkraut, Vojtech Cepl said at the time, discussing the issue.
However, in recent times, more and more lawyers have the opinion that the Czech Constitution needs changes.
Leta was tested with situations that its creators (among whom Vojtech Cepl belonged) could not predict, for example with the behaviour of the directly elected president.
But Cepl had a point.
All we know about such documents shows that political interference in their text must be thought through.
The institute must be understood and actively defended, only then can it be the key to dealing with the majority of crises that society faces throughout history.
The Constitution is, among other things, a kind of rule of governance consisting of individual rules that determine the politicians' playthings.
We are afraid that the power will be abused against minorities or individuals, so we connect policies with bans.
At the same time, however, constitutional texts also enable politicians to wield their power.
Covid: FN Brno Fights for the Life of an Eight-Month-Old Baby
Although it is known that the coronavirus is milder in children, severe cases have also been found, which hospitals have been dealing with mainly in recent times.
We know that children are less threatened and affected less than adults, speaking of 2 to 5 percent compared to adults, said the head of the Department of Paediatric Anesthesiology and Resuscitation of the University Hospital Brno and the Faculty of Medicine of Masaryk University Petr Dominik.
The process is much simpler, easier, and often occurs without symptoms.
Are children who are severely ill with the coronavirus, that's what we're seeing mainly in the last period," added Dominik.
According to the doctor, this involves dozens of children who need mild supportive care.
This is happening at a children's infectious diseases clinic.
Really very seriously ill children with coronavirus are only now being sent to ARU.
Children with post-covid syndromes were in the ward continuously throughout the year, according to the doctor.
Now we are seeing children with acute COVID pneumonia, which means they are having trouble breathing and need to be in an intensive care unit, he said, adding that the illness is affecting not just adults but adolescents and even toddlers.
Children are also getting severely ill in hospitals with the virus.
At the moment we have children from a few months old up to adolescence, the principle said.
We are pleased that no children have died of coronavirus in the paediatric hospital in Brno so far.
According to the available data, six children aged between 0 and 14 died in the Czech Republic on 6 December.
According to Dominik, psychologist cooperation in children's hospitals – not just in the coronavirus ward – is an integral part.
It also points out that just as in adults, vaccination mitigates the course of the illness and reduces the occurrence of the post-covid syndrome in children too.
We are also recommending it for children, the doctor added.
In the quiet zone you can only walk on designated paths.
Although the quiet zones are not as large as that.
You can see them on the tourist map at map.cz.
Generally, in national parks outside the quiet zone, you can walk anywhere (but don't cross the fence into the pasture).
Skiing/riding a bike in the forest without marked trails is not allowed anywhere if you don't have an exception (but of course this is not so strictly monitored outside national parks).
How does a conductor train?

He learned to play the clarinet in Liberec and originally played in a forest band.
As a singer, he can perform almost any repertoire, and as a conductor, he not only works in Liberec's F. Shaldy Theatre, but, for example, in Pilsen, in the Josef Kajetán Tyla Theatre.
It cooperates with the Hradec Kralove Philharmonic, the Film Philharmonic or the Podkrkonos Symphony Orchestra.
China is building up a sense of mastering the outbreak and that the authoritarian regime is handling the crisis better
Sinologist Jirouš: China is building up the impression of successfully tackling the outbreak and that the authoritarian regime is handling the crisis better.
China has launched a healthcare and political offensive.
Beijing reflected criticism a couple months ago that it failed to stop the outbreak that became a global pandemic.
The country is now reporting zero new infections.
Countries including the Czech Republic are competing for Chinese protective equipment and Chinese doctors are helping in the fight against the coronavirus, even in the worst affected areas of Italy.

World events are controlled by the powerful.
Although sovereign states are equal, it is precisely the great powers that determine the course of international relations.
Europe can only become such a power if it works on its integration.
This works on the level of economic and political (in selected issues), but it is missing military integration.
Personally, I think Europe is heading towards federalisation.
For 10, 15 or 20 years.
But maybe in half a century things will be different and it will work out.
It occurred to me and it is possible.
I am not a Czech expert, so perhaps I am making mistakes.
I am going on the assumption that an ellipse usually includes 2 different units on the same level.
I am borrowing an example from another comment "Spanish oranges and mandarins", where it is clear that both are from Spain, whereas with "Spanish fruit and mandarins", it is not clear that the mandarins are from Spain.
Moreover, I am based on the assumption that the sentence reads "all American forces", including their weapons, and I know that American complexes are operated only by Americans.
In other words, I am expecting that this is included in that broad concept and it is not necessary to further specify this for the American forces.
Again, just for fun:D
Whether it is or not, it is an unreasonable demand

Vicki Holland, from Britain, tortured kitten Milly
Shocking footage shows the moment a terrified monkey hunched in a toilet bowl before being flushed out by her heartless owner who then laughed at her.
Hollandová also fed the parakeets, kebabs and hamburgers regardless of their actual dietary needs.
A magistrates' court in Gwent now banned her from keeping animals for life, the Sun newspaper reported.
Experts in primate rehabilitation who have been caring for Milly after her ordeal said they had never seen an animal so traumatised.
Milly spent almost two years in rehabilitation with workers at Monkey World in Dorset and is now happily playing with another rescued monkey called Moon.
The mother-of-four admitted two charges of causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal.
At Newport Magistrates' Court she was given a 12-month sentence, suspended for one year.
Hollandová was also sentenced to 120 hours of unpaid work, given a lifetime ban on keeping animals and must pay a court fee of CZK 12,000.
Team leader Steph Sawyer said: "Milly is doing well but the rehabilitation process will continue."
Milly lingers, getting used to people again.
She cowered and hid from everyone she met, and any loud sound or sudden movement made her shriek.
Opička was refusing food for a long time.
Now, settled and content with the male, the sight of a new man can still provoke panic.
The psychological scars from the abuse will live with her forever, Sawyer said.
Milly's ordeal came to light after police discovered sickening footage on her phone following a raid on her home over drug allegations in Gwent.
The trailer features Milly swearing loudly.
In the second video, it can be heard that Holland offers the monkey cocaine and says: "Want some cocaine?"
I want to hold your hand.
In May, she admitted possession of cocaine with intent to supply alongside her partner Russell Cox (43).
Cocaine worth £1,600 was found hidden inside Kinder Eggs at his house
Cox was jailed for 30 months and Holland was given a suspended sentence of 20 months.
What incredible concepts you must learn from that ancient times three times in a row when you bravely jump over the whole of the 20th century?
Are you going to carry the same things with you as you did in the first grade?
The idea of bifflation, when no one cares who you are, whether you can or understand,
Write a test for 1 and then nobody cares.
Run and ask people at random in the street whether they can work out the character of the roots of a quadratic equation and its coefficients.
Everyone has been through it, and the vast majority don't even flinch and tell you they have absolutely no problem with it.
What is this curve teaching us?
I am a big fan of general overview and the fact is that people give up and do not have the need.
At this point, it's unnecessary and it will never be the same for them.
It will be partly for the many people who will need it.
Well, I mean, this note to say that you don't need to stand by the machine for all of these facts, I thought it was deadly serious... because you just don't need to.
Moreover, we are gradually getting to the era when not knowing the meaning of the pun is the norm.
(Where I think our communist past and sticking it to intellectuals and elites probably plays a part) But the price of that is simply too high.
If journalists could count, then probably never did the covid reach these dimensions.
At first glance: War between Kadri and Andrey continues!
This is the main reason why I cannot leave Switzerland immediately," Andrea replied on Instagram in Stories to the inquisitive questions of fans as to what it was that Kadir did to her that made her decide to end all contact with him and even block him on social media.
Mezi Kadrim and Andreou have been struggling since the beginning of the experiment.
The main problem was the fact that Kadri lived and worked in Switzerland and his idea was that Andrea would move after him, at least until he returned to the Czech Republic permanently.
She absolutely refused it.
As it is seen, their relationship did not end with love, but rather grew into mutual disrespect up to hatred.
It was a planned attack! fumed Kadri, reacting to Anderson's accusations of lying, gambling and debt.
Kadri's supposed honesty did not please his ex-wife or his younger sister Linda.
She decided to publicly support her brother.
'I would never normally comment on things like this and we never used to talk about it in our family.'
Nechci rozhodně vyvolávat nějakou lítost.
But when I see someone who is publicly bullying and trying to trash the name of someone I love so much, it just doesn't sit right with me.
I am sorry to have to do it this way but I want to publicly thank my brother Kadrim for being such a great character and helping our family so much when we needed it most when he was so young.
Ouch, that hurts even more when I have to read such untrue information that is probably so far removed from the context.
I would like everyone to know Kadri as I, our close ones and family do, in response to Andrey's words.
I am really grateful for everything!
Of course people will believe what is written but the most important thing for us, his family, is that we know the truth and that he was loved and that we know how it really was, she added vaguely.
The thief climbed up the facade to the fifth floor.
Do you believe in why.
His robbery spree began in the car park of a residential estate, where he tried to break into several cars.
According to available information, the sum of around CZK 320 was stolen from one vehicle.
There was nothing better than climbing to the fifth floor and abseiling into the apartment.
He stole two bananas.
In footage from a security camera, he is then seen walking away from the scene, eating a banana.
When the homeowner awoke the next morning to find the bananas were not where they were supposed to be, he called police.
Cchaa then detained him.
The man admitted he had been drinking on the day of the incident.
In view of the fact that he needed money, he decided to robber.
The matter is currently under investigation.
The thief climbed up the facade to the 5th floor, where he stole two bananas.
Pandemic law is time-limited and its effectiveness is tied to the level of pandemic preparedness.
If this is repealed, the law will not come into effect.
The law will limit the scope of business activities
Is that reason enough for you?
The right to assemble will be restricted, but not abolished.
On Saturday, elections to the councils of four municipalities saw more than 60 percent of voters go to the polls.
New representatives of the people were chosen in the communities of Komňa u Uherského Hradiště, Lužice u Mostu, Nová Ves u Liberce and in Rovné u Pelhřimova on Saturday.
The number of representatives in these municipalities has fallen below the number stipulated by law, or the elected councils have been dissolved.
A total of 99 candidates applied for the 28 seats on Saturday.
The average age of the newly elected representatives is 46.7 years.
The oldest is 69, the youngest 33.
Processing the results of Saturday's vote marks the end of a challenging, but successful year for us.
A total of four new or repeat elections to municipal councils, and above all the highly anticipated election to the Chamber of Deputies, took place in it, said the Czech Statistics Office's vice-chairwoman Eva Krumpova.
Reminded that due to the COVID-19 epidemic, the elections were more demanding in terms of equipment and personal security.
In the 7th constituency in Uherský Brod, the election on Saturday was won by the Association of Independent Candidates, which received 27.76 percent of the votes and two seats in the seven-member council.
The STAN ticket received 24.84 percent of the vote, which also means it won two seats.
Two seats in the council went to Citizens for Komna, who received 18.52 percent of voters.
Again, Jana Křižková, the current mayor and a member of the Association of Private Individuals, was elected to the council.
Communists - independent candidates - got one seat in the representation.
I got 75.48 percent of the eligible voters.
In the village of Rovná, near Pelhřimov, the Pro Rovná association won.
It won 50.5 percent of the vote, or four of seven seats.
Two representatives of the Association of Independent Candidates 1 and one of the Association of Independent Candidates 2 made it into the Town Council.
Turnout was 93.62 percent.
The Association of Lužice and Svinčice, led by Mayor Jindřich John, again won the elections in Lužice on Most.
It received 56.73 percent of the vote and, like in 2018, will have four seats on the seven-member council.

It got 76.7 percent of the vote.
Independent candidates of "Hope for New Village" won the elections in Nová Ves, Liberec.
The association of independent candidates received 59.88 percent of the votes, thus gaining four seats in the seven-member municipal council.

Turnout was 42.9 percent of voters.
On Tuesday, the results of the election will be debated by the State Election Commission.
They will then be published in the Collection of Laws.
What do you think would be a bigger problem?
Dead civilian or foreign politician?
I think that all that people write to you here you understand well.
You play on the idiot to make him "fight" with whom.
If not, that is sad.
I do not believe that Christians are degenerates, nor anything like that.
Now I rather like a number of church buildings for aesthetic reasons (which after all was the point, to look good).
It is all the same to me who believes in what.
On the other hand, I dislike how much power the church had in the Middle Ages, how much money they accumulated, the suppression of science, etc.
Talking about all wars, which caused, for example, the thirty-year
Long story short: believe in a spaghetti monster if you want, but the state and the church have nothing to do together
The man fell forward twelve metres.
It survived the concrete.
The incredible fall was survived by a man in Ostrava on Sunday night, when rescuers from the Regional Health Rescue Service reached him.
Staff at the regional operational center took a call at midnight on Saturday with initial information about a man having fallen from a height.
Two ambulance crews from the Czech Red Cross were dispatched to the scene.
On arrival at the scene the medics found that the man, in his late 70s, had fallen from a window some 12 metres above the ground and landed on his head on the concrete below.
In Vítkovice they mined coal.
But it was not as it should have been and the firemen went to the scene.
When the rescue teams arrived, the man was unconscious, with multiple injuries and in direct danger to his life.
The attending physician intubated his airways, ensured artificial ventilation of the lungs, and after further pre-hospital emergency care measures, the sanitary vehicle transported him to further care at the Ostrava trauma center, according to ZZS MS kraje spokesman Lukáš Humpl.
My greater fear is of inadequate public and official reactions than of the coronavirus

How serious is the situation from their point of view?

Legendary Nunes fell after seven years, Oliveira defended the belt
MMA experienced a parade of interesting results.
It all goes down at UFC 269.
Outsider Julianna Peňová managed to beat legendary fighter Amanda Nunes, who had not lost for seven years.
Charles Oliveira had no trouble making lightweight, winning a unanimous decision over Dustin Poirier to retain his belt.
Kai Kara-France also scored a victory, taking out Cody Garbrandt with a first-round technical knockout.
Sean O'Malley also beat his opponent.
A surprise, unlike anything expected.
The women's bantamweight bout between famous Amanda Nunes and Julianna Peña will take place.
The American came into the fight as a perceived "giant" but Nunes has not lost in seven years and was sharpening her teeth for another triumph.
The beginning of the duel thus took place in the spirit of the paper agreement.
Nunes started aggressively and even knocked her opponent down with a push kick.
However, Peňová was not forced to make any further mistakes and she herself attempted unsuccessfully to attack by grabbing the hand.
The second round was thrilling and hugely entertaining for MMA fans.
Both competitors were characterised by a host of excellent strikes and hard hooks.
In addition, Penova knocked Nunes to the ground where she began to strangle her.
Ta musela snahu vzdát a atak odklepat.
The American had prepared everyone for a huge shock when she became the new champion.
The main event was a battle between Charles Oliveira and Dustin Poirier for the lightweight title.
Poirier started well but the cards eventually turned against him.
In the second, Oliveira tried to be more active, and his opponent attempted to knock him out with a punch to the hand.
When he found himself in serious trouble, however, he came under huge pressure, his opponent was knocked down and a flurry of punches followed.
Thanks to that he won the second round.
In the third round Oliveira showed a rear naked choke, which Poirier resisted for a bit before eventually having to tap.
The Brazilian thus defended his title, but Poirier lost after two years.
In the next bout, Sean O'Malley recorded a supreme triumph, knocking out Raulian Paiva with a hard right to the body in the first round.
He then hit a string of precise blows to record his 15th triumph.
Kara-France did manage to beat Cody Garbrandt.
Nunes celebrated another triumph with her daughter in the spring, after seven years she has now lost.
Which knee?
At first glance, nothing complicated.
Most nouns in Czech represent only one grammatical gender, and therefore there is no problem in determining whether they are masculine, feminine or neuter.
There is also a fairly large group of essential nouns in which the gender is not stable.
Such important names fluctuate between two genders.
When declining, they take on double endings and in some cases remain in the uninflected form.
For example, the words "svízel" and "kyčel" are masculine and feminine, in the first case they are declined according to the pattern "machine", and in the second according to the pattern "song".
In another group of essential nouns, different declensions are used in the first person singular, for example: "order/orders", "woman/women" or "potato/potatoes" (meaning food).
Both are written, have the same meaning and are therefore freely interchangeable.
Some expressions may differ regionally, for example "okurka" in Bohemia and "okurek" in Moravia, in this case the Moravian variant is ungrammatical, similarly other Czech-Moravian pairs of words: "příkop" and "příkopa", "kobliha" and "kobliha" etc.
Some words that have come into Czech from other languages are originally uninflected, but gradually adopt Czech inflection.
A typical example is the word "image", which is masculine and feminine, or the word "buffet", which remains in the middle gender and has endings in the masculine form according to the pattern "castle".
Turkey has opened the way for migrants to Europe.
How is the situation right on the Greek borders?
Tension has arisen on the Greek-Turkish border due to the growing number of migrants who are trying to get to Europe.
Thousands of people have begun to cross the southern border of the Schengen area after Ankara stopped protecting them.
European politicians are promising to support Greece, and the Czech government is also preparing humanitarian aid.
What actually motivates refugees to take the uncertain path?
How does the situation look on the ground?
For three months we haven't seen blue skies and we've been gasping for air, journalist from Sydney described.
Fires that have ravaged Australia for four months have killed nearly three dozen people and hundreds of millions of animals and devastated millions of hectares of land.
How are the local authorities and the inhabitants dealing with the disaster?
Is the government doing more to prevent the drastic cuts flagged by critics of Prime Minister Morrison?
What will the country have to prepare for in terms of climate change in the future?
Lenka Kabrhelova speaks to Sydney-based journalist Ika Detrich.
False accusations have always been and are very rare.
Everyone always writes completely everywhere.
It is unpleasant to deal with how sexual violence looks in our society and how widespread it is, so we try to downplay it.
I don't know anyone who has been wrongly convicted.
I know a lot of people who have been raped and I've seen how they are often treated by their environment or even the police.
The victims should always be believed.
It has become clear that the victims are finally opening up about their traumas.
But very few people actually do it.
And there are those who wrongly accuse someone.
It is an insult to all victims of sexual violence, but spreading the idea that "most accusations are false" and that it is a "trend" helps only sexual predators.
Czech Republic flooded houses under construction, families have no money to complete them
Prices for building materials have risen by more than 30 percent in recent weeks and months.
It has left a number of people in a precarious situation.
It therefore does not have the means to complete unfinished family homes and banks are refusing to increase mortgages.
In addition to the cost of materials, the cost of construction work is also increasing.
People do not have enough money to complete already started family homes.
In many cases banks refuse to increase mortgage loans, which creates extremely unpleasant situations.
In a best case scenario, people move into half-built and uninspected homes.
In the worst case, the built houses are uninhabitable and families are forced to sell them because they cannot afford the mortgage and the rent," says BHS economist Stepan Krecak.
We are building two to three family homes a year and at the moment fifty percent of that is happening.
As a construction company it is hard for us that we have to adhere to some things in the contract even though the material has become more expensive.
So we are working for free," said construction company owner Zdenek Slivoň.
Most people will still have financial problems.
If they had calculated that the construction of the house would cost five million, now it will be seven.
I think some will be waiting," added Slivon.
The material most affected was copper, iron and also installation and plumbing fittings.
Construction companies are also struggling with a lack of workers.
In the Czech Republic, a lack of graduates in technical fields and an influx of foreign workers are hindering the pandemic.
The situation regarding the issuance of building permits is currently the most favorable.
The building authorities issued 7,675 building permits in October, which is almost 10 percent more than the year before, Křeček specified.
We are doing well and will continue to do so.
But the true vision is missing, says the commentator for Czech Radio – myRadio.
The entry into the new year, apart from classical celebrations, has traditionally been accompanied by political speeches.
In addition to the prime minister and ANO chairperson Andrej Babiš and the Christmas message from President Miloš Zeman, the nation was also addressed by the chairs of the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies.
What is the essential thing we have learned?
Just as my diploma thesis is super, I have my own topic, which I chose, it is related to my bachelor's degree, I work on it all year round and then write the written part for a week or two.
The state is completely calm with us if the person is not a total idiot and something has remained in his head, so that the commission will not needlessly strangle him on theory.
For example, I spent a week learning about the state and when I was at the end of it, the commission always tried to lead me to some logical deduction which immediately dawned on me and I got it right.
As for those projects, I know people who pay someone to do their semester project for them (we did it many times, very useful, very educational), and then they just learn the project and have it done.
According to me, it is great when at the end of the subject there is a test, which includes knowledge gained within the project, not just defense.
Everything but don't send emails and don't call the embassy and don't send any packages there.
You will be the same kind of scoundrel as them.
Those idiots in the embassy have nothing to do with it.
If they were against Russia they would be taking a big risk so maybe they have to play with them because otherwise something might happen to them.
But without any problems you can put up a statue of Putin next to the statue of a bear.
It would be funny if he did that, so that Xi Jinping would stumble over it or something.
I agree, despite Insta giving artists a hard time.
When you post stories every day and a new picture every other day, your achievements become minimal.
Moreover, it changes what is more important for the function, whether likes, comments or storage.
I have been struggling with this recently so I may have to reduce myself to a tweet where quite a few artists in my field are successful and I can't compete with that.
In the end, I would be happy if something more user-friendly came along that didn't rob artists of all their creativity and energy
Declaration of the Donetsk People's Republic
Svazu - yes, break-up - no, express their opinion against the break-up of the USSR.
Thirty years since the illegal break-up of the USSR.
On December 8th, 1991, the biggest geopolitical catastrophe in the history of mankind took place.
On December 8th, 1991, in Belovezhskaya Pushcha, Boris Yeltsin, Leonid Kravchuk and Stanislav Shushkevich, without any legal rights and in violation of the results of the referendum on March 17th, 1991, with an openly friendly attitude towards Mikhail S. Gorbachev, secretly and regardless of the people, signed an agreement that "the SSR as a subject of international law and as a geopolitical reality ceases to exist."
With one stroke of the pen, they "wiped out" the land of almost three million people.
The collapse of the USSR led to millions of ethnic Russian citizens finding themselves abroad.
Since the early 1990s, the population of Russia has decreased by ten to eleven million.
With respect to the loss of the Russian population of the former Soviet republics, we have already lost more people than in both world wars together!
Even earlier, the same people who destroyed in one sitting what had been built in the previous seventy years in Belovezhskaya Pushcha betrayed the socialist camp (created by the price of millions of lives in World War II and the Great Patriotic War).
They consciously undertook deindustrialization, hindered agriculture, and separated from the fourteen republics that had previously been economically united in a single mechanism, the world's largest superpower.
If we look even deeper, we can see the impoverishment of the population, the breakdown of the economy, science, the army, the growth of crime, inter-ethnic conflicts, the war in Chechnya, all the conflicts in the post-Soviet space, a series of orange revolutions, the expansion of NATO to the East, the war and the break-up of Yugoslavia, the Arab Spring, the war in Syria – all this is the result of geopolitical capitulation, the surrender first of the socialist camp, and then of the Soviet Union.
There is such a concept in politics as "vacuum of power".
Everything that was betrayed and given up rapidly filled and conquered the NATO countries that accepted our geopolitical capitulation.
The whole world is still shaken mainly due to events at the end of the eighties and the beginning of the nineties of the last century.
The price of the product sold in the supermarket with a large turnover does not directly correspond with its quality.
On Tuesday we have some meat in the supermarket that costs 189 Kč / kg.
If I buy it I will put it in the freezer and make it for dinner on Thursday.
In an alternative reality, where I don't buy the meat on Monday, the chain reduces it to 99 Kč/kg on Tuesday - can you explain to me the mechanism by which the price of the meat becomes a burden on my digestive system?
Or I will wait until Thursday and the meat will be cheaper by 69 Kč/kg - how is this meat different from what I bought on Monday for 120 Kč and left in my freezer for 3 days?
I answer for myself - nothing.
"These things that when something is cheap, it must be bad, corrupted or low quality, they are terribly retarded, to be honest ;-)"
Recently, not long ago, I went to Brno to Hlavas and in the underpass some woman was handing out some brochure, I always take such things to help the volunteers, throw it away...
No, the brochure was full of rural common sense and conservative views of the world, but nothing about God, I was confused, but I had a feeling that it would be some kind of agitprop.
After studying it, I found out who published it and it turned out to be Scientology.
No, because it was a good movie, full of completely unnecessary advice, as if I need to take a shower and not be a pig.
The forest would not perish because of the paper.
I went through something similar with an ex-girlfriend.
Psychological manipulation and emotional blackmail will force a person to comply with you because you like them, without being aware of how much power the situation gives you.
She threatened me a few times that she would hurt herself because I went out with a guy she didn't like.
Please don't leave me now, when I wanted to leave her apartment earlier, she begged me on her knees not to go anywhere.
Then she started physically blocking the doors.
That year we had a great relationship, but then we went our separate ways for half a year and it all started going downhill from there.
Then I ended the relationship by telling her I was leaving and that I would call her the next week to talk to her and calm her down so she wouldn't do something crazy.
Such a person sucks the energy, emotions and overall joy from you.
Rather hold back
When insurance companies compete by purchasing batches of tests and hunting down the positive, without which that horrid disease would not be known without a test.
The only thing we are achieving is complications for companies, transport companies and others, because their employees have been given five days' home detention by the random number generator.
In the West they have stopped messing around and recognised that it is not worth trying to treat an illness less famous than the common cold.
Poor Válek is new and has to put on some weight and charge his ego with inventing buzzing.
I think that we are getting back our old good smith.
After a few years of decline and suppression of this dirty business, MLM recruitment is returning to the surface.
I was one of the recruits, I tried it (I was 20, a first-year student at VŠ), initial vows about studying products and commercial skills quickly turned into "it doesn't interest you, mainly irritate people".
I was genuinely interested in the products I was selling because I wanted to help people, but the training was more about scaring and intimidating people.
When the first paychecks arrived, people quickly realized that if they wanted to earn, they had to produce several products monthly.
Investment life insurance and mortgages were the only earners, so he felt like a man selling hats on the corner.
What I can say is that the experience was valuable, people learned that they should not jump at every speck and that information should be carefully verified.
At the same time, I wouldn't put all my eggs in one basket.
People are successful in this business and it is even beneficial for people, but those certainly will not complain about expensive consumer goods or "fancy" accounts.
In the corporation where I work, I have not experienced such things.
HR is asleep, managers are looking at their own management and they are not interfering in anything.
Regular evaluations are therefore happening in some way, in the form that it is happening with us, so we set some goals for the next year, we look back at what has happened and what has not - it is rather self-evaluation than that someone evaluates you according to some numbers, and so on.
Voluntary actions also.
Just that we are a bit unique within our company - there are departments that are more "corporate".
Sometimes you have the feeling that we are almost a startup that is squatting in the offices of a big corporation no.
As long as it works, it doesn't bother us too much.
Czech woman missing in Britain found dead
Her body was found in London.
For almost ten days, the police in the UK have been searching for a 32-year-old Czech woman who went missing at the end of November.
On Sunday 12 December, the Minister of Foreign Affairs in demission, Jakub Kulhánek, announced on social networks that a woman had been found dead in Uherský Brod.
British police confirmed to our embassy in London this afternoon that they had found the body of a missing Czech woman.
The cause of death is being investigated.
We will not provide any more information about the case to the family.
In all seriousness, Kulhánek said on Twitter.
The last time he saw her was on November 28, when he dropped her off at work and she went to the cash machine to get money out.
Her disappearance was reported to work colleagues five days later.
As a result, the Metropolitan Police began searching for her and Interpol added her to their list of missing persons across the world.
He was also found in the Czech database of missing persons.
Police in this connection detained one man a few days ago.
In what way he was to play a role and what he suspected, but did not publish.
In the four municipalities, new councils were elected at the end of the year.
On Saturday 11 December, new councils were elected in the communities of Komňa on Uherskohradišťsku, Lužice on Mostecku, Nová Ves on Liberecku and Rovná on Pelhřimovsku.
The number of representatives in these municipalities has fallen below the number stipulated by law, or the elected councils have been dissolved.
In the new elections, 99 valid candidates ran for the 28 seats.
Turnout stood at 62.41 percent.
The highest turnout was recorded in the village of Rovna, where 93.62 percent of eligible voters cast their ballots.
A total of eight women and 20 men have been elected.
The average age of elected representatives is 46.7 years.
The oldest is 69, the youngest 33.
A total of 13 lists of candidates was registered for the new elections of representatives in the above-mentioned four municipalities.
Thirty-six women and sixty-three men applied for 28 representative posts.
The average age of the candidates was 46.6 years.
The youngest candidate was 22 while the oldest was 72.
Processing the results of Saturday's vote marks the end of a challenging, but successful year for us.
Four new or repeat elections to local councils, and above all the very closely watched election to the Chamber of Deputies, took place in it.
Meanwhile, we are mostly working in more demanding epidemiological conditions which place greater demands on equipment and personal security, said Eva Krumpova, the Czech Statistical Office's first deputy chairman.
The last constituency was processed at 03:49 on Sunday 12 December.
On Tuesday, the results of the voting will be discussed by the State Election Commission and, after approval, will be published in the Collection of Laws.
This is the biggest problem I have with the whole pandemic.
I struggled with the fact that I had a really dangerous contagious illness at the beginning, but it went without too much fuss.
I have a problem with the way a large part of the population, from all levels, are behaving like idiots towards it.
I am most looking forward to being vaccinated (tomorrow!) because it will mean I will finally be less dependent on others not being idiots.
He was relieved of the functions of the president and disqualified from re-obtaining them.
The chance of that really happening though is very small.
Moreover, I am not sure whether the recording of the register could be considered a breach of trust at all.
Velezrada is such an act that endangers the sovereignty, territorial integrity, or democratic character of the state by the President of the Republic.
It should have been something more serious.
How the pandemic has transformed intimate life: The number of people under 35 who are celibate for a year is rising
The more young adults in the US are choosing to live their lives without sex.
This mainly affects people with a religious background, writes the DailyMail website.
The poll showed that the proportion of people under 35 who are sexually inactive has risen from eight per cent to 21 per cent between 2008 and 2021.
The number of sexually inactive women aged between 18 and 35 has increased more than ever before.
An increase in the number of sexually active individuals is also contributed by other factors, according to a survey by the Institute for Family Studies (IFS).
Some of these may include the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic and higher levels of unemployment.
The presence of the media, social networks or video games, which make sex a lesser and lesser priority for young people, could also contribute.
Since 2010, there has been a rapid increase in the proportion of men and women aged 18 to 35 who report having had no sex in the previous year, according to IFS researcher Lyman Stone.
When it comes to humans in relationships, sexual activity is more common, with only 5 per cent claiming to have gone a year without sex in 2021.
Among the general population it was 29 percent, Mr. Stone said, adding that marriage before the age of 35 is a small percentage.
The reduction in sexual activity is also contributed to by fear of premarital sex and religious beliefs.
Despite this, the proportion of married or cohabiting men under 35 who are sexually active is still falling.
Young people are divided on the issue of premarital sex - around 30 per cent see it as a bad thing, while around 70 per cent think it is okay.
It's true that this group is a minority among this age group, but their behaviour is pushing this trend, Mr Stone says of the 30 per cent.
For the majority of those who have a moral problem with premarital sex, the reason is religious foundations.
Since 2008, the proportion of abstinence among young people under 35 who attend religious meetings more than once a month has increased from 20% to almost 60%.
The trend among "less believing" people rose from 10% to 20%, Stone said.
Other factors contributing to the drop in sexual activity include less social interaction and increased alcohol use during the pandemic, he said.
The study also showed that unemployed people or those with lower incomes have less sex.
Another reason may be the proliferation of digital media, which apparently reduces the need for sex.
People are spending more time online, thereby "fulfilling" this need.
This trend has been mainly driven by the lockdowns during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Compulsory vaccination against Covid is about whether society should force a part of the population to do something they don't want but which might save their lives.
It is a difficult question, which personally most interests me the question of social responsibility.
For example, the question of whether, when we stop them and they die, it will be our fault.
My argument is that absolutely we can for the death of an 80-year-old man who actually didn't know what was going on, we really didn't explain it to him, he heard some misinformation and as a result of that he didn't get the jab and he died.
On the other hand, I do not think that we can mourn the death of a die-hard opponent of vaccinations, who together with the SPD and the Communists is making a fuss about something to do with persecution and a totalitarian state.
From those statistics, which I mentioned, it can be clearly inferred that the majority of unvaccinated pensioners probably belong to the second group, i.e. they will really be able to pay for it themselves.
Snowless Czechia.
How does a mild winter relate to the fight against drought?
This winter so far has brought one of the smallest snow cover in the Czech Republic in recent times.
Ski area operators cannot do without technical snow, and the weather even complicates the preparation of the cross-country Jizerska 50 race.
Is it a trend, or an exception?
Will little snow be a good sign for the fight against drought in Czechia?
I have a story for you, but it doesn't involve a baker.
Once, during middle school, our teacher led us across the entire city to the shipyard so that we could sail on boats along the river.
That's how we once walked down such a very wide street, and we couldn't see anyone in the middle - followers of the Hare Krishna sect.
Of course we feel sorry for ourselves.
I managed to escape, but I got talking to one friend.
When they left, we asked the teacher what she had said to them.
He asked me if I wanted to save my soul.
I have told them to their faces that I have no soul," she replied.
Everyone, including the teacher, walked the entire route until the boatyard.
We were dreadfully embarrassed.
It's not that much, but the system is already creaking, says Orozovic.
New German Chancellor Olaf Scholz arrived in Warsaw on Sunday after previous visits to Paris and Brussels, where he was greeted with military honours by Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki.
We are opening a new chapter in mutual relations, Morawiecki said at a joint press conference after the talks.
Scholz stressed that Europe must jointly make it clear that it will not accept the violation of Ukraine's territorial integrity.
The crisis provoked by the movements of Russian troops near the Ukrainian borders can be solved by using diplomatic negotiations and within the "Normandy group", which brings together France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine.
Morawiecki said that the chancellor had been informed about the situation on the Polish border with Belarus, whose leader, Alexander Lukashenko, had artificially provoked a migration crisis and used people as live targets and weapons, as every night dozens of attempts are made to (illegally) cross the border.
The Secretary of State was negotiating further sanctions to bring home to the Lukašenko regime and its patrons in the Kremlin that we are determined to defend the eastern border of the EU.
According to the DPA Agency, Scholz confirmed that Warsaw is enjoying German support in its dispute with Belarus and condemned the inhumane treatment of refugees by the Lukašenko regime.
Polish nun caused accident, tried to cover it up
For a moment the car returned to the scene of the accident, but it was being driven by another nun who tried to take the blame upon herself.
When the police told her that she could still lose her driving licence and be fined for not giving way at an accident, she accepted the truth, TVN24 reported.
She admitted that another nun had knocked on the vehicle asking for help.
The police came for his sister Celestina.
They gave her a breath test, and when they discovered she had more than twice the legal limit in her blood, they immediately suspended her licence.
At the same time, they announced that they will plead their case in court.

Czech creators of family comedies have taken a look at American stories about puppy love.
However, they forgot the essential thing: the law of the film profession.

Co-author of the screenplay and director Juraj Šajmovič ml. follows on from his previous film Tady hlídám já from 2012.
The talking hedgehog Hugo returns to the scene, along with some familiar faces.
Julie and Ivan, owners of a pension in the Sumava mountains, which is about to go bust, so they start taking in boarders, Julie's father with his partner and above all her daughter Veronika.
She is no longer a little girl, but a young woman experiencing her first love.
The director and his partner, Beatriz Šajmovičová (who is also the film's producer), struggled with the narrative in the previous dog film, but at least the children and the dog were entertained.
This time the creative duo have come up with a weaker script that will trigger a mix of amazement and a sense of trap.
Let's sum it up.
As a scientist, Julie falls prey to the delusion that she is pregnant and, when the "constellation" is right, copulates with her forest engineer, Ivan, wherever the coordinates dictate - on the hood of a car or the bell tower of a church (of course during an excursion with a local guide), discharged Colonel Mojmir, despite years of training, shoots his own daughter (Julia), who falls into a coma, and is taken to hospital by the family so that the miraculous process of healing could take place in the heart of the Sumava wilderness.
Nic against purifying nature and the strength of animal milk.
Its owners know why they have them.
The audience is amazed at how much content full of unbelievable situations and figures was required for this message.
Two pairs of thieves from the staff, a competition for pigeon fanciers, a Šumava charlatan, the police arriving on the basis of a tip to search for "drugs", and discussing herbs with bone meal - and which roasted family in the boarding house of course got drunk.
When the heroine awakens after a heavy coma and promptly sits around the family table, smoking a cigar and demanding a father's whiskey and soda as a recovering vegetarian, you can't help but laugh.
The creators also explain to the viewer that "sometimes it happens after anesthesia".
Shajmovic's team lacks basic dramaturgical knowledge of working with text, the ability to construct supporting situations, feeling for the characters and the point, and directorial guidance.
The performances are uneven, the cutting dull and the overall impression uninspired.
Although Lukas Vaculik, Jitka Jezkova and Nela Boudova are trying to save their parties, they have little to play with.
The only saving grace of the film is the poetical depiction of the Šumava countryside by the camera of Vladimír Holomka and the duo of Jezevčíks.
It is not enough to sketch a few characters, a chatty plot and canine sound effects, let alone people-friendly vulgar expressions, for the characters to use.
Neither is being a long-standing member of the Jezevci Breeders' Club - as is the case with the producer.
If we want to promote nature and the friendship of man with dogs, we must also have knowledge of the craft, if a person wants to tell a believable story.
In this case it did not succeed.
This is a good family film with just a bit too much erotica and minimum respect for the genre.
Ani as a piece of advertising for cannabis would not have passed muster as an amateurish effort.
Well respect, because museums have to listen to the incessant chatter of people like you.
The difference between offering and forcing, here you can see, how much sense of humour you have, but it is just because you have never tried it.
The decision is always with the customer, if he doesn't want it, the answer will always be no.
If you were such a kid who listened to furt, maybe I would change my opinion.
It's work like any other, in his case a gang on the take.
The close east is plagued by unusually dry months.
It is the only time of year when it drizzles.
Almost no rain during November, as we have recorded at some stations, is unusual, the Israeli Meteorological Service confirms.
For example, the village of Kfar Giladi in northern Israel records only six percent of the long-term rainfall average for November.
This week's double rainbow was therefore something of an exception.
It is good for us.
Long time no see.
It is also the right Christmas decoration, Nazareth resident Wasim Aschkar is happy.
Rainfall in Israel arrives almost exclusively in the winter months, and is sporadic and irregular.
Coniferous forests are dependent on winter rainfall.
Without them, bees die out and are prone to fires.
It is not just about forests, but also about sources of drinking water and irrigation for farmers.
Israel's largest freshwater source, the Sea of Galilee, has filled up to the brim this spring following three wet winters.
Since then levels have dropped.
Water managers have been warning of drought for a long time.
It is expected that rainfall here will decrease as a result of global warming and climate change, said Uri Schor of the Israel Water Authority in 2018.
Israel can help with technology such as desalination or wastewater recycling.
Poor countries such as Lebanon, Syria and Jordan are worse off.
In the streets of Jordan's capital city Amman, the number of tanker vehicles is increasing.
Water pipes and private wells dry up.
This September, truck driver Imad Sulejman announced that "complaints have decreased by seventy to eighty percent compared to the previous two years."
There were clashes between farmers and security forces in Iran's Isfahan.
The reason for the protests was drought.
The bed of the local river was completely dry.
The region has the driest November in many years.
Israel is preparing a military strike against Iran
Israeli Defense Minister declared that the talks in Vienna did not produce "any progress" and informed Washington about preparations for an attack on Iran's nuclear facilities.
Minister Benny Gantz declared on Saturday that he had instructed the Israeli army to prepare for the possibility of a military attack against Iran, informs Jonathan Lis.
Gantz, who lives in the U.S., has been trying to persuade Americans to increase pressure on Iran but has also been informing Washington about military preparations.
During a press conference in Florida, Gantz said that the nuclear talks in Vienna had not produced "any progress" and world powers "understand that the Iranians are playing with them."
This happened to me about 3 years ago.
I flirted a bit and grilled him during the conversation to find out what he really wanted from me.
Eventually, I discovered that my suspicion of the pyramid was justified.
Since I really do not like these lies, I stopped the woman for a moment and asked her some questions and then thanked her and left.
Please tell me I'm an idiot but the pyramid is a pyramid and financial advisers are financial advisers.
Skiers headed for the mountains at the weekend, hoping for enough snow and good weather
The Czech ski resorts experienced their first big rush of skiers this weekend.
Despite heavy snowfall at the end of the working week, there is no shortage of snow and some ski resorts have begun operating.
Sjezdaře neodradila ani povinnost prokazovat se u vleků covidovým certifikátem.
While vets are not complaining about a lack of interest from customers, some ski hire firms say they are getting less business than before the pandemic.
Thousands of people took part in running events and downhill skiing at the weekend in the Liberec region.
The skiers have been favoured by the weather, which today offered both sunshine and excellent snow conditions.
We are happy that the competition weekend has really come out of that Friday evening's skiing, when we had our first skiers on the hill, enthused the director of the Ještěd Sport Centre Jakub Hanuš.
The first weekend of cross-country skiing in the new season also drew large numbers of people to Jeseníky.
For example, the Karlov Ski Arena or the centre in Branna near Sumperk could be opened.
The weekend attendance was very decent, around 400 people arrived on Saturday and today as well.
The conditions are suitable.
Today the sun was shining, around minus three degrees, so perfect, without wasting words, was the representative of the skiing centre in Branna, Rostislav Prochazka.
Ski resort operators can only sell lift passes to people who are vaccinated or have tested negative for the virus.
People are prepared for exceptions and prove the necessary documents, CTK's René Hroneš said from the Spindleruv Mlyn ski resort.
We have recorded just individual incidents, he added.
Some rental and ski equipment outlets are reporting lower interest than before the pandemic.
The interest in borrowing skis is fortunate.
It's not the same as in previous years, but there are still enough customers, said Alexandra Bokišová from the Skiopava sales point in Opava.
There is greater demand in the period of the skiing courses.
The managing director of the Hradec Králové company Snowbear David Šinták feels that there is now less interest in the borrowing of skiing equipment due to the covid virus.
We were almost bankrupt before the pandemic.
Compared to the period before the pandemic, we are around 50 percent, said CTK's Šinták.
People according to him have become accustomed to the pandemic and have learned to stay at home.
On the other hand, the rental company recorded a large demand in the Novako on God's Gift complex.
Rental of skis began a week ago, and those interested must now book them in advance.
We are starting to rent bikes this weekend, but people have been calling ahead, so we are expecting a lot of interest, just like last year, said operator of the site Pavlina Novakova.
According to her the same interest as before the epidemic is also in the skiing school.
If we want successful and rich people not to go abroad, they must have the opportunity to live a quality life here as well.
Certainly not socialist healthcare, where it is not often possible to find a dentist or a specialist doctor.
Foreign countries are losing clever and skilled people who own nothing there.
The owner of the company going abroad is just a fact that cannot be changed.
I agree completely.
If these people will not live well in the Czech Republic and if these people will not have a reasonable future in the Czech Republic, then they will simply not live in the Czech Republic.
The emigration from Hungary started in such a way that one beautiful day Orbán won, he governed for a year and suddenly the annual emigration increased by a couple of tens of thousands.
To think that the Czech Republic cannot find itself in a similar position from one day to the next is naive.
Another question is whether elections will be held at all.
If you live here, you might as well vote for some traditional V4 loony.
The young and educated will leave, while his supporters and people whose assets do not fit into the plane will stay.
Scary photo!
Langmajer for the blood due to a bet on beer?
While autumn was in full swing in the Czech Republic, the film crew of Island, led by 55-year-old Jiří Langmajer, were enjoying the tropical climate in Thailand!
Here he published a bloody photo of his face on social networks.
Is it a genuine injury, or is it because of filming?
Police in London are still searching for the missing Czech.
She was last seen hitch-hiking home.
Her disappearance is completely out of character and we are becoming increasingly concerned for her welfare, Det Insp Lucy O'Connor, from Lambeth CID, said in a video appeal on Saturday.
Her family in the Czech Republic are very worried about her and they just want to know where she is, she continued.
The missing Czech allegedly left work about 7.45pm on Sunday November 28 and headed home to the Camberwell area.
She was last seen on the bus about half an hour later.
Her disappearance was reported by one of her colleagues on December 3.
Srncová worked as a "healthcare assistant" at the Evelina London Children's Hospital, which is part of the Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust, according to British media.
Our dear colleague Petra is missing, the group of healthcare facilities said in a Twitter post.
We would appeal for anyone who may have any information which may assist our investigation to contact us, the statement continued.
MP Harriet Harman called for public collaboration in a press conference on Saturday in the wake of the SNP case.
I've been looking for her for days, she's 32, she's from the Czech Republic, her parents are understandably devastated, the Labour MP said, holding a picture of the woman released by the Metropolitan Police.
I feel we all have a particular responsibility to try and find her because she was outside her home country, away from her family and working out here for our health service, Ms Harman said.
Police had already detained one man in connection with the case, who remains in custody.
However, according to the news website BBC, the police did not provide any information regarding his identity or what he is suspected of.
Russia is not capable of occupying Ukraine, and certainly not with 30 BTG (i.e. about 5 divisions).
I do not underestimate Ukraine either.
They are not "gigantic numbers", but about 8 percent of the Russian army.
You understand that Ukraine constantly repeats that the threat of invasion is exaggerated and it is becoming increasingly difficult for us to enter.
I apologize.
I don't know on the basis of what he concluded that Russia wants a war.
War is very expensive and Russia has the GDP of Italy.
Comparing it to the situation in 38 is in so many ways that I don't even know where to start.
I can compare it with the first Punic War and the "annexation" of Sicily :D
I cannot imagine that after Ukraine announced that it would not abide by the Minsk agreements, Russia would annex these crazy republics.
That's it, and that "concentration" at the borders would correspond to that.
Oh no, pacta sunt servanda...
In Prague, new traffic regulations come into force on Sunday, mainly affecting suburban services
Travellers in Prague's integrated transport system (PID) can expect a few changes from Sunday, which mainly concern suburban services.
New lines were introduced, some with changes to the route, and others disappeared.
The newly integrated system now includes Mladoboleslavsko.
In the capital city, express trains from Czech Budějovice stop at the Zahradní Město station on Sundays.
In the suburban train transportation, the S7 trains run on the route from Berlin to Czech Brod via the main train station in Prague.
The recently opened station Praha-Zahradní Město will now serve fast train R17 from Czech Budějovice and Benešov.
PID is expanding into new areas.
In addition, buses will run to Světlá nad Sázavou, Blatna u Jesenice, Starých Splavů and Turnova.
Buses will run on Mladoboleslavske, including lines that extend to the Liberec and Hradec Kralove regions.
The integration will result in the abolition of 77 lines, the introduction of 37 new ones and the modification of the operation of 12 existing ones.
A new bus line, number 405, will leave from Prague's Zlicin and go all the way to Žatec.
A new direct line has been opened between Prague and Kralovice u Rakovnik, which replaces the cancelled train line S53.
The services will be strengthened in the morning peak and on weekends with trains from Prague to Rakovník, where a new express line number 404 will start operating.
Lines 400 and 410, which run to the Liberec region, have now been incorporated into the PID system.
They will depart from the Střížkov metro station, not from the Nádraží Holešovice station.
The main line 400 passes through Mělník, Dubou and Česká Lípa to Nový Bor and selected services continue to Rumburk or Cvikov.
The supplementary line 410 goes through Mělník and Dubá to Doks, Mimoně and Jabloň in Podještědí.
On the other hand, new operations are being introduced on ten local lines in Central Bohemia, including to Mochov, Dobris and Rozmital pod Třemšinem.
All trains leaving Prague at 02:30 have been cancelled.
Due to the modernisation of the railway, long-term restrictions continue on the lines from Prague to Beroun, Prague to Lysa nad Labem and around Kolin.
Changes are also in store for travellers at other locations.
The buses will replace some of the cancelled railway lines or extend the section on line 420 from Dobris with a connection from Prague, where it will be possible to use PID tickets to Milevsky.
The changes will affect lines 540 to 543 in Nymburk and the routes of some buses on the border of Central Bohemia and the region of Hořovice in the Plzen region.
Healthy snack/lunch from the supermarket to the office
Hello, I do a 9-5 with a 30min break and my only option to get food is to walk to Billy or a bit further to Lidl.
As I have no movement, I have no energy to train after work, so I must eat healthily and diet.
I'm sorry, I never know what to buy and in a rush I buy the maximum pizza and for dessert yogurt and an apple.
Question: What healthy, uncooked food would you recommend I buy in a supermarket?
Everyone does not expect a metre of snow like you, unfortunately.
These are not trees that you have to see.
Only the very top of the tree can be hidden by the snow.
If it is weakened, the tree may be more vulnerable to fungal infections.
I accept that it is the only reason they are banned from riding on anything other than motorways, but it is one of them.
Recognition of love for Nedved: I was not at all looking for that
The Czech showbiz pond has been alive with nothing else but the revelation of the relationship between Dara Rolins and Pavel Nedved since last Friday.
They have been an item since the summer, and the famous footballer even divorced his singer girlfriend.
Dara then sent a lengthy message to fans to explain why she had kept her love for them a secret for so long.
I am willing to say that currently no one in the Czech Republic or in Slovakia has escaped the fact that Dara caught a bear, sorry, Nedved, jokes Dara Rolins, who is deeply in love with the most successful Czech football player up to her ears.
But he did not deny it, on the contrary.
Three days are the focus of attention, though they are used to it, they do not enjoy it.
Here it is.
But, na co jsme se oba netěšili, ale věděli jsme, že k tomu jednou dojde, continues the singer.
I don't know who is worse.
Whether you don't care at all and it bores you, or us, whose lives it completely absorbs.
As if someone from you wanted to hear your opinion on whether it is appropriate to go out with your husband or boyfriend, or whether you insist that everyone knows in detail your list of former partners and be familiar with the record of your mistakes and errors.
It's a fact, you want it, Darling.
The pair jetted to Italy where Rolin was finalising her new fashion collection.
Nedvěd is also the long-term vice-president of the Juventus football club.
The truth only came out now because they were waiting for the end of the Nedved divorce.
He had been separated from his wife Ivan for three years, but they had only been officially divorced for three weeks.
In any case, to those who are happy with us and wish us well, we thank them.
I am just a person, we have families, children, past and dreams.
We are not perfect but I think we have both our hearts in the right place.
I love my new man and like he is with me, I am with him, through thick and thin, Rolins said.
Hello, others have probably already said everything important, so I just confirm that halls are great until the beginning, my classmates mostly got to know each other and became friends during the first semester or two and found accommodation together, which seems to me the best option as you know with whom you will be living.
Most of these ICOs don't last very long, so you're not likely to find many of them now, but taking a look at the range certainly won't hurt.
Definitely not only Cejlu, but also the surroundings (streets such as Vranovska, Francouzska etc., that is a very bad address), and some parts of Židenice are a bit of a ghetto.
In contrast, the district of Veveří is very student-oriented, and Králův pole and that direction are fine, apart from that it is close to the majority of VUT faculties (I don't know exactly which one you are enrolling in).
I have never rented accommodation, but I was born in Brno, so I can advise you on Brno as such, if you need any information.
But that is just an example of "normal" thinking for me.
Because of what a number of doctors somewhere in Poland have decided to do, it is completely in order that the state is insufficiently funding certain schools.
Either learn what they want and pay for it themselves or go according to the state and pay the state.
After all, we cannot allow private entities to control education just because they contribute a few crowns and thus have the ability to determine what is taught in schools.
Such claims carry less weight when made by someone who two days earlier was expressing support for a petition campaign against a totalitarian state:
So the vote against it is the same as the vote against having a statue in the square?
But it would be better to consult with that person directly who gave you the work.
I have already experienced during cataloging/digitalization that (and even long-term professionals) that this either goes in one eye or they write something on the xxx *** or ... (according to convention) and add a note that it is unreadable.
It is true that in this case it is quite readable, so I would not recommend it at all.
I would deal with it personally by perhaps writing a note as to which program you used.
If you want to be a decent and diligent student, you can look for some sign language databases and find the nearest one.
Because it looks like you are quoting from some book, I would assume that the author or the printer simply created their own logo which sits comfortably with what is physically on the coin.
P.S. Is it not rather the Odryan Empire (kingdom) than Odryan?
PSS: someone already told you that rubbish here.

Politicians have no idea what the subject of our Presidency will be.
This is much worse than having interpreters.
The idea that something is approved because no one understood a text is laughable.
All important approved documents are examined word by word, the same basic knowledge of English is not enough, that's the lawyers.
Hundreds of translators and interpreters work in various EU institutions, English suits politicians better for informal contacts, for establishing above-standard relationships.
And with English too, it's quite interesting after GB left the EU.
I will not let you down.
I have been working there for third year and I am completely at ease.
How many times have I driven home from work in the evening and never had a problem.
Only someone who has never really lived there can say that it is a ghetto.
Yeah, most of the Romani population in Brno lives there, but the only thing they do is block the sidewalk and park wherever they want :D definitely not that I would be afraid to walk on the street there at night.
So if you were looking for relatively cheap accommodation with good access to the city centre, I would be happy to go there.
There are now newly reconstructed or newly built houses there.
Felix Slováček (78) without his dad and girlfriend Gelemová as a stake in the ground!
How will you spend Christmas?
Most people lit their first Advent candle on Sunday, but Felix Slováček did not.
I don't have a Christmas wreath, so there was nothing to light.
I saw Dády wearing a wreath and Lucie certainly has one too, said the saxophonist, confirming Patrasova's words that he often visits her.
He visits, but does not live in their home in Vinohrady, where Dada remains alone after his departure.
The boy still doesn't know where he will be on New Year's Eve.
Recently we met with Anička, Felix and both grandchildren.
VIDEO: Felix Slováček and Lucie Gelemová: AGAIN TOGETHER!
Felix Slováček and Lucie Gelemová: AGAIN TOGETHER!
We were just chatting, so it didn't happen over Christmas.
I really don't know where I'll be.
I'll be buying things gradually and I'll certainly get something for my dad and Lucia, maybe perfume.
'I am a gentleman,' said Felix, who had come up with the idea of the music video shoot in the Richman club in the first place.
I am alone, but I don't feel alone.
I always find someone to chat with, says Slováček, who was glad to have met the wife of Luďek Sobota, Adrian, and singer Kamila Nývltová.
He made it very clear.
On my island, why can't we have enough soldiers and weapons?
We count on someone to defend us and our location is so strategic that the aggressor would have to be a complete idiot not to occupy these territories.
If you can't provide a good argument, then why should I explain it to you?
I do not know of any other component that could be deployed in a crisis in hospitals.
There are few police officers and they cannot afford it, so firefighters and nowhere else have such a high percentage of medically trained people at such a level.
Firstly, that our army is capable of defending Ostrava at least as well as the previous governments, not the army, which has been asking for new toys for far too long.
Exceptional drought in the Czech Republic.
It is necessary to change agricultural subsidies, so that the countryside is not just a factory for food, says the journalist.
The Czech Republic is going through the worst drought in years.
According to scientists, water has disappeared from mountainous and sub-mountainous regions, and even places where there has never been a shortage of water are recording a smaller amount of rainfall.
The cause of the drought that prevails in much of Central Europe is climate change.
The impact is also intensified by the way we work with the soil.
What can we do in connection with drought preparation?
How can we help nature in difficult times?
That is how it should be, as long as I keep the skates on the ice, mushrooms know how to play hockey and that tactic (which I tried in Franchise Hockey Manager) is overall nonsense.
Whether it is the "golden team" of Russia or the "lama" of China, losing by two goals even if you don't have to win at all is different than when the score is even.
So, as it is, I listen to Czech commentators who pick out what the referees are missing, whether it's in men's or women's hockey, it's all crazy, but that's how it is with all sports, UEFA and "Italian actors" or motorsport F1, WRC, etc.
controversy is everywhere.
If it were the opposite, then it would always be the same, and that Czechia has more often lost to Russia than won, so it would be a classic "we lost" vs "WE WON".
Coronavirus: Number of cases in Russia passes 10 million
On Saturday 11th December, the Czech Republic recorded 9080 daily cases.
5766 people have been hospitalized.
A total of 34,451 people died in the Czech Republic and another 74 are still missing.
Confirmed cases in the last 14 days in the Czech Republic stand at 1967 per 100,000, 871 per 100,000 in the last week.
The number of cases in Russia on Sunday exceeded 10 million.
There were 29,929 new cases in the last 24 hours.
This is the lowest daily number since October 13.
Total registered cases in Russia is 10,016,896.
The number of daily deaths stood at 1,132, the lowest daily toll since the end of October.
Britain is facing an "inevitable" major outbreak of the virus, caused by the Omega strain, Dr Susan Hopkins, the chief medical adviser to the Department of Health, said on TV on Sunday.
This will require new quarantine measures.
People infected with omega are already being hospitalized in Britain and Hopkins expects those numbers to grow.
None of the omega patients have died yet, but they are being hospitalized about 14 days after becoming infected and dying about three weeks after becoming infected.
The head of the British Labour Party, Keir Starmer, stated on Sunday that Boris Johnson probably broke the law by holding a Christmas quiz in Downing Street in December, when there was a lockdown and Christmas parties were banned.
A spokesman for Johnson's government said the questionnaire had been conducted "virtually," over a computer.
But the event was also attended by a group of Downing Street staff gathered around computers.
There is pressure on Johnson to remove himself from the prime minister role in the UK.
During December last year - when London was in lockdown and Christmas parties were banned - Johnson's ministers went ahead with numerous meetings despite the lockdown.
British public and media are outraged that Johnson and his government made fun of them:
Paul Brand, editor commercial television ITV for Britain: Two years ago today Boris Johnson won the general election in a landslide.
Today the Conservative Party is talking about the need to remove him from the post of prime minister.
Remarkable how quickly things have developed.
Do you want to tan and save your skin?
Hungary is holding elections in the spring that could end the 12-year rule of Viktor Orban.
The elections will have a European-wide significance.
How much can we hope that they will be fair?
Nebudou ferove.
It is not even free, because there is no such thing in the last two elections under Orbán.
His party, Fidesz, controls the media, changes electoral districts to benefit from that and does other big or small tricks.
The latest is that everyone can in practice vote where they want.
This would enable Fidesz to bring voters from the certain districts to those where the outcome is uncertain and where the opposition could win.
So it just means that there won't be any at all.
Do you think it will be the same as in 2014 and 2018?
It is always significantly different.
It was no longer about whether Fidesz would win, but how much and whether it would have a constitutional majority.
There is now a real chance that a united opposition will win more votes and seats.
This is a great exception for Viktor Orbán and his party.
Nebudou ve snaze udržet moc hrát ještě tvrdě?
Well, there are some indications that they are ready to go beyond what they did so far.
Recently leaked to independent media was a recording of the parliament speaker and Fidesz leader László Kövér, in which he tells the heads of the secret services that the opposition is a threat to national security.
What are the signs of this new approach that you are talking about?
Well, that is one of the newbies.
Everything starts with language.
I bit my nails very often, for the last time when I was 14, my mother has no patience, neither do I, my aunt has it for a long time but then bites extremely (only in connection with me).
At the same time I was very choleric and I was trembling like a little girl, to such an extent that I was lying on the ground in the fetal position and I was completely blue, they put me under the shower about 2 times to calm me down.
Sometimes I would scold them educationally, sometimes it was more that they did not know.
I definitely have a tendency nowadays to solve things violently, as a child I was a bit of a scamp, nowadays I have to hit something with a stick or something to get it out of my head (so I don't get too carried away), so never anything extreme, but always that urge to mum.
I am not able to determine to what extent it is my impulsiveness, but certainly that education also has its part in it.
I am afraid that I will also lose patience with the same child and solve it the same way.
I think that beating children is simply wrong and that my parents should not have done it, especially not at that point when it was no longer "educational," but out of frustration, perhaps every parent does something like that, so I cannot blame them for it.
I don't understand why OP should be ashamed of me.
The laws should be clear and unambiguous.
I would therefore call you what the laws are in such quality.
What I was interested in was whether you were avoiding a drop in income?
Can we really count on the fact that people want the product and will buy it and that you will have something to hypothecate to pay for?
Kočner's Mad World
Is Slovakia moving the process with the murder of journalist Kuciak?
The main trial in the case of the murder of Ján Kuciak and Martina Kušnírová begins in Slovakia.
The death of an investigative reporter and his partner changed Slovakia.
It stirred up civil society, but also uncovered the practices of accused entrepreneur Marian Kocner and his ties to the top of Slovak politics and justice.
How fundamental a breakthrough will the process be for Slovakia?
For this colossal amount, journalists
How is it possible that this petition had several times more media attention than the counter-petition of all the deans of medical faculties, which came out one day, two days later?
Kdepak, we let ourselves go and the company stumbled.
Covid was killing people on Czech TV over half a year ago.
Another government ends and the law on the involvement of municipalities in the selection of a storage site nowhere
The design of the Karl Havlicek Ministry must be fundamentally reworked
The government of Prime Minister Andrej Babiš is nearing the end and the law that should ensure respect for the interests of municipalities and their citizens in the selection and licensing of a high-level radioactive waste repository does not exist yet.
The government's legislative council cut short debate on a proposal submitted to the government by the Ministry of Industry and Trade after lengthy delays.
However, its content is in serious conflict not only with the affected communities united in the Platform Against Deep Mining, but also with the Association of Towns and Municipalities of the Czech Republic.
The Act expects significant strengthening of its possibilities when deciding on a repository, which mayors have been promised since 2011, when the first work on this legislation began, and which is required by the Czech nuclear law and European directives.
We expect that the new government will revise the proposal in cooperation with municipalities in accordance with their coalition agreement.
The draft law from Minister Karl Havlicek, which the Platform has at its disposal, criticise the municipalities above all that the proposed level of involvement of municipalities and the public in the decision-making process on the selection of a site for the repository is inadequate and cannot guarantee respect for the interests of the municipalities and their citizens.
Only then can it be truly effective if communities and the public can influence whether the process goes ahead at all in a particular location.
To ensure that the obligation to deposit with the Deposit Office is met by requesting the consent of the affected municipalities before commencing a specific proceeding.
The proposed draft resolution almost completely ignores the involvement of the public and makes citizens of the communities practically mere statistics in the licensing proceedings.
The design is missing system settings for compensation for municipalities throughout the process of seeking and selecting locations for storage, its permission and operation.
Community representatives have little chance of defending the interests of their citizens when it comes to finding a site for a repository under current legal rules.
In some licensing proceedings, they may submit their views or appeal, but the authority or minister, in whose interest it is to issue the licence, makes the decision.
Any action for damages does not have a suspensive effect on the carrying out of exploratory or construction works.
The participatory decision-making that the Platform advocates is a principle commonly used in many democratic countries and undoubtedly in those that have gone furthest in licensing stores, such as Sweden and Finland.
The preparation of the bill is in addition to another failure of the state administration, which hires external legal advice for the preparation of legislation.
In this case, it is a contract with the law firm HAVEL & PARTNERS s.r.o., which the SÚRAO concluded and which follows on from contracts with lawyer Jan Zemánek.
According to the register of contracts, the total sum for these works is almost 4 million crowns.
Antonín Seknička, the local councillor for the village of Cejle from the Hrádek locality and spokesman for the Platform Against the Deep Storage of Highly Radioactive Waste, said: "After the ministers of industry, who rubber-stamped the position of local authorities vis-à-vis state authorities when looking for a deep storage facility for highly radioactive waste, we are expecting a U-turn from the new government."
We are offering a helping hand with that.
We are also grateful for the support of the Association of Towns and Municipalities, which views the issue of inadequate rights of municipalities in such crucial infrastructure projects similarly to the directly affected municipalities in selected locations.
The Platform Against the Deep Storage Facility brings together 51 members (35 municipalities and towns and 16 associations) with the aim of promoting a change in the state's approach to dealing with vitrified nuclear fuel and other radioactive waste that will not be limited to the deep storage facility.
The Platform further promotes that decisions on the selection of locations for possible deposition should be conditional on the prior consent of the affected municipalities.
Herce Johna Goodmana (69) donutil k hubnutí strach: Shodil 90 kg.
Although he had no need to change his lifestyle for many years, doctors eventually scared him.
They told him if he did not recant he would die.
To take away.
Goodman gradually slimmed down to 90kg - half his original 180kg, according to The Sun.
He celebrated his new role in Los Angeles at the premiere of animated series The Freak Brothers.
The guy from the Roseanne sitcom is a completely different person!
John joked that his pals and family asked him to slim down as his large frame was causing damage to furniture.
I did everything I could with my mouth, the actor said in an interview with AARP in 2018.
This time I wanted to do it slowly.
Fight, train.
I'm coming to the age where I can't afford to sit down, Goodman, whose transformation is amazing, joked with ABC.
It does not matter, good boss and in what you want the word "boss" to be used.
If it is a text on a platform that is expecting readers from a gaming environment, I wouldn't translate it at all.
If it was a matter of a formal text and perhaps a university one, I would seek to describe or explain the matter in more detail.
There are more types of bosses.
A game like Dark Souls, for example, has several bosses, so that "boss" is something like a lord / ruler of a level, and then there is the final boss...
In many games, there are hidden bosses (super boss), who are not at all necessary to beat to complete the game or level, but are often stronger than standard bosses.
There are games like Half-Life, where the bosses are, but the player never actually encounters them (Tentacle, Gargantua), so what do you call them?
No way are they mini-bosses.
No way to translate "boss" into a single word in any language that I can think of, Czech included (interestingly, Catalan has a word for "boss" that is the ultimate adversary).
In short, for a story or game generally meaningful, computer-controlled, stronger than all previous adversaries and watching the completion of some level or task.
The London-based Petra is being searched for all over the world.
The Czech police have also been involved.
British police have been searching for Peter Srnec since 3 December.
The Czech police are also involved in the search.
The 32-year-old woman has been missing from Uherský Brod since 7 December.
Through Interpol, it is also helping the British police.
Her colleagues last saw Czech Petr Srnka on 28 November.
British police have been searching for her since December 3.
Interpol issued a so-called yellow notice for her.
So Peter is roaming the world.
The Czech police are closely cooperating with the British police, police spokeswoman Kateřina Rendlová confirmed.
We are sharing information about the case, she said.
The search for Peter was already published on the police website.
According to him, she is 168 centimetres tall, plump and has brown eyes and long straight hair the same colour.
She was from Uherský Brod.
Petra worked as a nurse in one of London's hospitals.
Friends and colleagues are concerned about her, as such disappearances are very unusual for her
The search for Peter was joined by local MP Harriet Harman.
She got involved in putting up posters with Petra's face on them.
We have huge concerns, she said at a press conference on Saturday.
In connection with the changes, British police have already detained one suspect.
However, it is not clear who this refers to or what they had in common with Petra.
Pre-Christmas Czech Republic terrorizes Agent Tesla.
While data in October pointed to a modest decline in attacks, last month saw a significant uptick in violence as the year-end approaches.
We noted a large campaign in connection with Agent Tesla on November 18.
The attacks are specifically targeted at the Czech Republic.
The attackers' strategy thus far remains the same.
The attached document in the email is likely to attract the user's attention with a name that refers to payments and financial transactions.
While the previous month had a dangerous add-on with the word "bill" in its name, this time it was called "Copy of Invoice for 11,2021...exe," said Martin Jirkal of Eset.
Spyware contains functions that scan internet browsers and other programs, for example Microsoft Outlook email client, Mozilla Thunderbird or Yandex.
The malicious code actively seeks out stored login data, which it then sends to attackers.
The last strong campaign took place in the Czech Republic in late August and September and with the upcoming holidays and the end of the year, the activity of the attackers is growing again.
In November, the spyware Formbook remained active.
In contrast to the Tesla attackers in this case, the attackers are not specifically targeting the Czech Republic and security experts caught rather a global campaign in November.
In comparison to the Formbook data for November, it slightly weakened in October, but still accounts for nearly a fifth of all detections.
The attacks continued throughout the month with increased activity on November 3, 10 and 15.
The formbook contained the most common attachment with the suffix .exe, which was called REQUEST FOR SPECIFICATION.
The name of the account still keeps cropping up though.
The attachment in Czech could then be far more dangerous for a Czech user.
Security analysts have noted a significant decline in activity within the Fareit programme, which was responsible for 1.6 per cent of attacks, and there have been no major attack campaigns in the Czech Republic in recent months.
Today's demo of smarties, who don't need oxygen, because oxygen is for vaccinated idiots.
The procession through Prague was larger than the media are reporting.
According to the picket line and my experience of being a demonstrator, I would estimate the figure to be around 10,000 people.
The people in the procession filled the quays and the opposite bank communication.
It means that people really care.
A procession of about 400 demonstrators is joined by an unprecedented number of passers-by.
I am saying that something new is being born here, writes Radek Mokrý.
The long-term dissatisfaction of several large groups or strata of the population led to the fact that they found a common language.
Even individual anti-vaxxers, anti-mosquito people and the like would not be able to provide such a large crowd, nor pay for it.
Campaigns by the Czech Pirate Party are becoming increasingly popular, reminds me of a Million Moments for Democracy.
Sometimes I have the impression that they are even renting the same podium and technology.
It is difficult to say what movement could be made from this dissatisfaction, it depends not only on the supply of money, but also on whether the three-dose vaccine from Pfizer does not become a four and more dose vaccine.
Definitely not a leftist nor centrist movement, get that through your head.
The jab will almost certainly become a booster because it's clear we'll have to wait six months between doses.
I am very glad that vaccines saved us.
Brilliant actions of scientists, for which humanity has every right to be proud.
End of Patu, Bulgaria Has a New Premier Promoting Change
Bulgarian President Rumen Radev tasked Kiril Petkov, leader of the anti-corruption movement Continuing the Change, which won November's election, with forming a new government.
He has already managed to put together a broad coalition government which should take office in a matter of days.
The political crisis in the country has been ongoing since April, when the previous government lost power in the wake of anti-corruption protests.
The victorious parties who campaigned against corruption and the abuse of power failed to reach an agreement, so there followed an early election.
What do cats do when no one is watching?
A global hit is made from footage shot "secretly".
There have been growing concerns over the weekend in Britain about the fate of a 32-year-old Czech woman who has been missing in London for several days.
Petra Srncova was last seen two weeks ago when she was heading home from work in the southern part of the British capital.
As well as police, her employers at the children's hospital and her MP, who represents the part of London where she lived, were called.
Her disappearance is completely out of character and we are becoming increasingly concerned for her welfare, Det Insp Lucy O'Connor, from Lambeth CID, said in a video appeal on Saturday.
Her family in the Czech Republic are very worried about her and they just want to know where she is, she continued.
The missing Czech allegedly left work about 7.45pm on Sunday November 28 and headed home to the Camberwell area.
She was last seen on the bus about half an hour later.
Her disappearance was reported by one of her colleagues on December 3.
Srncová worked as a "healthcare assistant" at the Evelina London Children's Hospital, which is part of the Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust, according to British media.
Our dear colleague Petra is missing, the group of healthcare facilities said in a Twitter post.
We would appeal for anyone who may have any information which may assist our investigation to contact us, the statement continued.
Zdenka Dvořáková Kocourková, an amateur children's room painter from Šumperk (and also a regional pirate councillor), denounced an anonymous complaint that her paintings infringed copyright.
The court found that the Krtečka paintings in the Shumperk accommodation do not breach the law.
In Ústí nad Labem, a month-long hole in the road was filled in the form of a channel without a ramp.
It was life.
The Magistrate referred the complainant to the Road and Transport Authority, which owns the road, but the hole got bigger because it did not act.
Eventually, the authorities clarified responsibility and ownership, and after a month the RSD began "intensively dealing with the situation".
