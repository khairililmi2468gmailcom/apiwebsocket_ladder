At the annual meeting of Zhejiang University, students sang the lead, and the research results made people's brains wide open - Xinhua News Agency
Last night, a series of academic achievements with big ideas were awarded at the opening ceremony of the 2016 academic year of Zhejiang University.
The main researchers of these achievements are students, and the research covers a wide range of fields such as environment, mechanics, energy, medicine, life sciences, humanities education, and so on. Students started with a curious idea and created many high-end inventions with practical value, some of which have won awards in domestic and international competitions.
Bio-sensors: your family doctor
A team of PhD students from the Biomedical Engineering Institute, Zhang Di Ming, demonstrated a bio-sensor for a smartphone, which is only half the size of a smartphone.
"All you need to do is take a deep breath, and the instrument can give you a preliminary assessment of your health based on the composition of the gases you exhale. "
Zhang Di Ming explained that the sensor is connected to the smartphone, and the health report will be displayed on the phone after the gas is exhaled.
Smart wristbands that can detect health status on the market generally detect physical parameters such as temperature and pulse.
The bio-sensor uses a new material, graphene, to target chemical elements, and its acute "smell" allows it to more deeply and accurately reflect a person's health condition.
Smart surgical lights: doctors' high-energy eyes
In addition to smart phones, smart surgical lights were also used in the operating room.
The invention won a silver medal at the 44th International Invention Exhibition in Geneva, Switzerland this year.
The Ph.D. students Zhu Linjing and Shen Junfei of the School of Optoelectronic Science and Engineering have opened a new idea in the defects of traditional surgical lights, and invented the intelligent LED surgical light without shadows.
"Many diseases are not detected and removed in time, and are related to the lights used in the doctor's operating room. "
Shen Junfei said that if the doctor cannot see all the tumor tissues in time, the cancer cells will spread afterwards.
This intelligent surgical light has four light discs, which can enhance the contrast of different tissues under light by adjusting the spectrum.
During surgery, the doctor can adjust the size, brightness, spectrum, color uniformity and shadowless rate of the spot at any time according to the needs of the surgery and personal habits.
This intelligent surgical light has been used in the affiliated hospital of the School of Medicine of Zhejiang University, the affiliated children's hospital of the School of Medicine of Zhejiang University and other hospitals, and has received good feedback.
In October last year, this invention won the first prize in the National Challenge Cup.
Air hand-washing: save water and cool
Ordinary people wash their hands by rinsing with water, at most wiping some soap, squeezing some hand washing liquid, while Li Qiang and his classmates invented a set of “air hand washing devices”.
As soon as we stand on the device's sink, our weight can compress the air out.
"It's like a firecracker.
The compressed air forms a liquid at the faucet and combines with the water.
That way we can wash our hands clean!"
The color reaction and bacterial residue tests show that the effect of washing hands by this method is the same as that of ordinary hand washing.
This device only needs our own gravity as the driving force, which can ensure the degree of cleaning and save 90% of water, and the whole process is completely energy-saving and environmentally friendly.
Last year, the invention stood out among many top universities in the second Global Major Challenge Summit, winning the only gold prize.
Please arrange to return to me as soon as possible, thx
Please cancel the order and return the cash, no points, and never use #PRS_ORG# again!
Bone and spicy pickled vegetables are not suitable for children to eat
If so, please order as soon as possible.
No, thank you
He asked me to tell you where he is #PRS_ORG #
I waited and cancelled the order
I bought #PRS_ORG#, but I wrote the wrong address
Can it be changed?
or cancel the order
Okay, that's enough
A certificate that I found to be very meaningful - the First Aid certificate.
This is one of the skills certificates I feel is important beyond my driver's license!
In short: First aid measures are actually emergency rescue measures in the event of an emergency, that is, rescue before the ambulance arrives.
It is known that there is a period of time between the arrival of the ambulance and the accident, and this period is the most critical.
That's when you need emergency services.
If I really did have a heart attack, a stroke, or respiratory arrest, then our life window would only be four minutes, the golden four minutes!
So everyone around you knows how important it is to know first aid!
When someone falls around us, we can use our professional knowledge to rescue them, instead of standing there and doing nothing, feeling helpless.
"In China, we have official data that there are 300,000 accidental deaths every year, and the most dangerous is cardiac arrest.
In the United States, the average survival rate is 15 percent.
In Las Vegas, the survival rate is 78 percent, and in Shanghai and Beijing it is less than 1 percent."
This is what founder Lu Le said.
If someone has a heart attack, no breathing, no heartbeat, there's nothing you can do.
It was only possible to save the person by doing artificial respiration and chest compressions.
I found that we are not very aware of the need to learn first aid now, but it is too late when things happen, so I still urge everyone to learn this skill, so that we can react in time when faced with emergencies.
It could save one person's life!
First aid certificates can be obtained at the Red Cross training center in your local area. I applied at the Red Cross training center in Zhuhai, and there are discounts for students.
PS: The last picture is a list of things I wanted to accomplish before I turned 25, and adding a first aid kit to the list was a few months ago, but it's done!
Then I went to take other certificates I wanted to take, and I planned to take a diving certificate. I saw that there was a diving first aid certificate in Little Red Book. To take this certificate, you need to have a first aid certificate. Therefore, the first aid certificate is still very useful!
I ordered #NUMBER#.
One of the 13 yuan dumplings is one!?
I haven't tried it
Why isn't #NAME# spelled out clearly?
For $13?
Yesterday #PRS_ORG# missed the delivery, this time I got a shrimp dumpling to eat!?
Because I've seen it work before when I've typed in the code.
To sum up, I personally think that The Four Seas is an all-round bad movie, in every sense of the word.
But if you say that this movie is not a highlight, then it's not even a good soundtrack.
There are many kinds of bad movies, one of which makes you fall asleep in the cinema, another that makes you feel angry after watching it, and another that makes you feel like a monkey on the Emei Mountain, which can ignite your anger in countless ways.
In this regard, Han Han is truly a genius.
The most painful thing about this film is that it seems to be a creation in a K-novel, and it is difficult to describe, like Marco's windbreaker.
Even after watching it, you might wonder if there's a director's hidden metaphor in there, but when you think about it, it's just a pile of shit.
To begin with, I will briefly explain some of the things that are difficult for me to understand.
The man's home is supposed to be a small island in the south, and he lives with his grandmother.
Her grandmother had a wish to see snow, and the plot arranged for a neighbor to drive her to the northeast to see snow in a small bread van.
Elderly people in a van from the south to the north to see snow?
He and his dad are also very reassured by this.
Then the old man stopped speaking.
How did the owner's brother get a business license to open a hotel on an abandoned ship?
Why can the island's scooter gang easily block a section of mountain road?
Then the truck that was delivering the steel bars in the middle of the road stopped on the side of the road, and the truck driver could not be found around.
It's too obvious that this is a prop.
Why would a small, criminal motorcycle gang become an auxiliary police officer?
Why didn't the police report the high-interest loans? The police even specially asked if there were any difficulties?
An adult knows how to use a smartphone, but doesn't know how to use a room card to open the door in a hotel, and then forcibly arranges to sleep outside the door of the hotel without finding the hotel owner?
The whole film is filled with these inexplicable scenes, and they are so bizarre that I remember them with pain when I recall them.
Aside from the plot, what's worse is that the movie's theme, or lack thereof, is a hideous Frankenstein's monster.
At the beginning of the film, you think he wants to make a comedy, after 20 minutes you guess it might be an inspirational film, after half an hour you think it might be a story about the survival of young people in a small town, and after watching it, you don't even know what kind of film you've seen, followed by deep doubts about yourself, why go to the cinema to watch a shit?
For most people, they are actually very familiar with the plot of various movies, such as if you want to shoot a motorcyclist, then you need to be inspirational + comedy, and then tell the audience how a talented rookie steps by step towards success.
If you want to make a love movie, then you have to tell the truth about the feud between the small town boy who likes to ride motorcycles and the waitress's sister.
If you want to reflect reality, then at least your plot can't contradict the normal world.
(For example, the new motorcycle that Yang Zheng played was just burned, and the role that can sing can't go to open some brain holes that Kennedy can't see.
As for the heroine, who is not mentally retarded in some aspects, she acts like a five-year-old child. I don't know if it is because of the acting or the director's request.
There is one thing I don't understand, Han Han, as a race car driver, why is he so keen on adding a crash scene in his own movie?
Such a movie arrangement is in the Spring Festival, is it to add to the audience?

After years of practice and development, it has now acquired high-quality quality, mainly producing hydraulic, mobile and fully automatic check well series equipment and supporting devices.
Check the production and processing equipment of concrete modules in the well, and assemble the well-wall brick module equipment in Zhengzhou:
Check the concrete module production and processing equipment of the well-wall brick module device in Zhengzhou: the characteristics and advantages of the Zhengzhou well-wall brick module production and processing equipment:
Yixin checks the equipment of the coal, heat, water, electricity, gas and other municipal underground construction materials, which is widely applicable to the new construction materials of the municipal underground construction materials such as coal, heat, water, electricity, gas and so on.
Such as drainage, water storage facilities, rain gutters, ditches, septic tanks and small structures, bridge wing walls, etc.
The advantage of using concrete modules to build check wells is that the upper, lower, left and right sides of the modules are all concave and convex grooves, and they are combined to form a chain lock.
The shear strength of the wall body is far superior to that of the flat friction masonry.
The module is hollow structure, and the vertical holes are connected after the combination is built, and the horizontal holes are connected after the vertical holes are connected, and the core of the hole is poured with ready-mixed concrete, which plays the role of secondary reinforcement and waterproofing.
Modules are provided with slot holes in both directions, and the overall strength of the structure is increased by the corresponding increase in the number of slot holes in the longitudinal direction and the vertical direction.
In addition, the check well, drainage well built by the concrete check well module is not easy to collapse, sink, leak, etc. The mechanical performance of the well wall module is stable, and the operation is simple and the forming size is standard.
The concrete check well module brick machine equipment is equipped with data input and output devices, one-key touch liquid crystal display to monitor the whole process of mechanical operation, realize the ideal human-machine dialogue, automatic analysis of raw materials, density operation, safety logic control and fault diagnosis system.
The mechanical hydraulic system of the well wall body module uses a single-cylinder hydraulic system for conveying and a double-cylinder hydraulic system for conveying.
The independent hydraulic integration station avoids the impact of the host vibration on the hydraulic system, thus ensuring the reliability of the hydraulic system.

Chongqing Middle School of Vocational and Technical Education is piloting the modern apprentice system, and enrollment is equivalent to that of an employee of an enterprise - Xinhua News Agency
Yesterday, reporters learned from the city education bureau that this year, the city will pilot the "modern apprentice system" talent training model in 60 secondary vocational schools. At the same time, the students who participate in the pilot training will have the status of apprentices, and after enrollment, they will be pre-recruited by the pilot enterprises as employees of the unit.
The municipal education committee requires that the admission and employment procedures of secondary vocational schools be standardized, and the dual identity of secondary vocational school students and enterprise employees be clearly defined, and a tripartite agreement be signed between the apprentice, the guardian, the school and the enterprise according to the principle of two-way selection. For apprentices aged 16 years and under 18 years of age, a tripartite agreement must be signed by the apprentice, the guardian, the school and the enterprise to determine the rights and interests of all parties and the specific positions, teaching content and rights and interests protection of the apprentices on the job.
Encouraging pilot schools to adopt the modern apprentice system and cooperate with enterprises to carry out pre-employment training and transfer training for enterprise employees.
The pilot schools should reform the model of talent training.
Schools and enterprises jointly design talent training plans, jointly formulate professional teaching standards, course standards, job standards, master standards, quality monitoring standards and corresponding implementation plans.
The pilot is based on a pilot cycle, and the student's internship time in the enterprise is determined according to the professional talent training plan, and the top-level internship is generally for 6 months.
In the practice of enterprises, the enterprise team management model should be implemented. According to the characteristics of different professions, one master can take 2-5 apprentices to form a learning group to ensure that students master the skills required for each training post.
According to the arrangement, from 2016 to August 2019, our city has determined three batches of 60 city-level modern apprenticeships, each with about 50 people, totaling about 3,000 students (apprentices) .
According to the principle of first testing and then implementing, from point to face, gradually promote the establishment of a long-term mechanism of joint enrollment, joint training and integration of education, and effectively improve the students' job skills and employment rate and employment quality.

South African doctor: Omicron is highly transmissible but mostly mild
Many doctors and medical experts in South Africa believe that the Omicron variant of the coronavirus is less severe than the Delta variant, although it spreads faster.
According to the Associated Press, as the Omicron variant spreads in South Africa, a group of more than 5,000 doctors in the province of Gauteng reported that the symptoms of the new coronavirus patients they are currently treating are relatively mild, such as body pain and cough similar to flu.
Dr. Unben Pillay, the director of the organization, said he sees dozens of patients every day, but none of them need to be hospitalized.
"They can control the disease at home, and most people recover within 10 to 14 days. "
He said this includes older patients and those with underlying health conditions, who are more likely to become seriously ill with the virus.
He said that compared with the previous wave of Delta infections, the new coronavirus patients he treated in this wave had "difficulty breathing and low oxygen levels.
Many will be admitted to hospital in a few days."
Within two weeks of the first report of the Omicron variant in southern Africa, other doctors were also sharing similar experiences.
While it will take weeks to collect enough data, doctors' observations and early evidence have provided some clues.
According to the summary of the South African National Infectious Disease Institute: In recent weeks, only 30% of the new coronavirus patients admitted to the hospital are severe cases, which is half of the proportion of severe cases in the first wave of the epidemic; the average hospitalization time has been shortened from 8 days to 2.8 days; only 3% of the recent new coronavirus patients died, and the death rate in the early outbreak in South Africa was as high as 20%.
Willem Hanekom, director of the African Health Institute, cited data from the National Institute of Communicable Diseases and other reports to say: "At the moment, almost all indications are that it is a mild disease."
He added: "It's still early days and we need to get the later data.
In normal circumstances, hospitalizations and deaths tend to occur later, and we're only two weeks into this wave. "
At the same time, scientists around the world are observing the number of cases and hospitalization rates, while testing the effectiveness of current vaccines and treatments.
While Delta remains the world's main coronavirus strain, cases of the Omicron variant are emerging in dozens of countries, with South Africa as the epicentre of the outbreak.
According to health officials, there was a 400% increase in new cases in the first week of December in the Haudenosaunee region, with tests showing that the Omicron variant accounted for more than 90% of cases.
Thanks to today's supporters, all 80 boxes have been delivered!

Education Watch: What can be done to rescue abducted children?
If we compare the famous public service announcement that says "there is no killing without buying," then in a good environment where there is no demand for "kidnapping," group prevention and control, and the whole nation's anti-kidnapping will make the act of kidnapping unprofitable, risky, and costly, and this kind of crime will never happen again.
Recently, the Criminal Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security has launched an emergency release platform for missing children.
This is an Internet information platform created to establish an authoritative channel for the publication of missing child information and to help recover abducted children in a timely manner.
When I heard the name of the app, I felt very warm.
The new technology means not only has the name of "literature and art", but also has the information application, which is practical and effective.
The primary goal of enforcement is to recover the kidnapped children and protect their safety and freedom.
The second is the trial and punishment of the suspects.
The meaning of criminal punishment can be listed as individual punishment, social prevention, and legal education.
However, before the trafficking case is solved, the safety of the victims should be given priority.
Matters of urgency, such as whether the death penalty should always be applied to the trafficking of children, can be put aside for the time being and discussed with caution, but the rescue of kidnapped children cannot.
According to the experience of investigating such cases, traffickers tend to move away from the crime scene as soon as possible after they have made a profit.
The search for a missing child can be delayed for a minute, and the child may be further away from the parents, and the difficulty of solving the case will increase by one minute.
In this case, it is a pragmatic action to come up with a platform such as "Tuan Yuan" that directly helps to solve cases and find children.
After all, "kidnapping" is a big job that requires the whole legal system to work.
Fighting crime, protecting the rights of children and parents, from the improvement of the law, to the protection of the law, and from the meticulousness of the law enforcement, there is no need to implement the care for children and the weak.
In addition, the prevention of child trafficking from the family to the society can also be done better.
For example, in one common case, a family of three was resting at a train station, and the parents fell asleep, only to wake up to find their children missing.
Two-year-olds can't be expected to have sufficient self-protection skills, but as a parent of a young child, you should at least have some awareness of protection.
Parents taking turns to rest or placing their children in a safe environment are the least we can do to prevent children from being abducted.
From the other side of the police's crackdown on trafficking, buyers of kidnapped children should also be paid attention to and punished.
Individual bad acts are often just one link in a long chain.
According to the Criminal Law of China, the minimum penalty for the crime of trafficking in children is five years in prison; in particularly serious cases, it can be sentenced to death and property confiscated.
The higher the starting point and the heavier the penalty, the more clearly the crime of trafficking in children falls into the category of severe punishment.
There are still many cases of trafficking every year.
It is clear that some people are lagging behind in their conceptions of child-rearing, and their legal awareness is low.
The legal education of this part of people should be synchronized.
To effectively control the crime of human trafficking, it is not enough to rely solely on official strict enforcement.
If the "market" of kidnapping is widespread, the traffickers are greedy and constantly innovate their methods of kidnapping, and form a situation of "dueling" with the law enforcement officers, which is bound to fall into a low-efficiency quagmire.
Therefore, breaking the backward concept and popularizing the legal knowledge can also help to eradicate the crime of child trafficking and buying and selling.

The International Olive Oil Council divides olive oil into two main categories: virgin olive oil (virgin olive oil) and refined olive oil (lampante olive oil or refined olive oil).
Extra virgin olive oil, or extra-virgin olive oil, is the oil obtained directly from fresh olive fruit by mechanical cold pressing, filtration, and removal of impurities.
According to the acidity, it can be divided into three levels:
Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO): is the highest grade, highest quality olive oil, and is a pure, natural product.
The taste is excellent, with a delicate and pleasant plant fragrance, and the acidity is no more than 1%.
Extra virgin olive oil (Extra Virgin): slightly higher in acidity, but not more than 2%, pure in taste and aroma.
Ordinary Virgin Olive Oil (Ordinary Virgin Olive Oil): Taste and flavor are acceptable, and the acidity is no more than 3.3%.
Refined olive oil is olive oil obtained after refining the initial olive oil with an acidity of more than 3.3%. It is also known as secondary oil.
Refined olive oil can be divided into two levels:
Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO): Refined olive oil mixed with a certain proportion of virgin olive oil to harmonize the taste and color, with an acidity of less than 1.5% and a transparent pale yellow color.
Refined olive-pomace oil or olive-pomace oil (Refined Olive-Pomace Oil): is obtained by extracting and refining from the olive pomace.
If you have seen the grading system, you should have noticed that the acidity of olive oil is a very important indicator.
Olives are like grapes used to make wine, from different regions and different varieties of olives, different grades of olive oil will be produced.
The best places to grow olive trees:
The Mediterranean coast has the most suitable soil and climate conditions for the growth of olive trees, including the most suitable soil and climate conditions, such as sunshine, air humidity and rainfall.
Apart from the Mediterranean coast, it can only be grown in suitable areas in other regions.
The main production areas and production sites (Mediterranean):
Italy, Spain, Greece, Turkey, Portugal, Morocco, Syria, Israel, Tunisia, Algeria, Egypt, Pakistan, Lebanon, etc., have climates similar to those of Argentina, Peru, South Africa, etc., which are farther south in latitude.
The harvest month of olive oil:
From March to June is the time when the olive tree flowers and bears fruit, and from July to October, the fruit begins to develop and mature, changing from green to red, purple, and finally black.
November to February is the harvest season for fruit (the freshness of olive oil is very important).
The nutritional content of olive oil:
Olive oil is rich in monounsaturated fatty acids, such as oleic acid and linoleic acid, as well as vitamin A, vitamin B, vitamin D, vitamin E, vitamin K and antioxidants.
Olive oil is considered to be the most nutritious oil found to date.
The Democracy Summit ended, and Biden said that the flame of freedom would never be extinguished
The online "Summit for Democracy" (Summit for Democracy) convened by US President Biden and attended by leaders of 110 countries around the world, ended on Friday (December 10).
In his closing remarks, Biden said that the flame of freedom burns in the hearts of people all over the world, and that authoritarian regimes will never be able to extinguish it.
He also said that the second Global "Democracy Summit" will be held next year.
Taiwan's representative to the UK, State Councillor Tang Feng-ho, also spoke at the summit on the second day. Hong Kong democracy and human rights activist Luo Guanzong, who is currently living in exile in the UK, also spoke at the summit on the second day.
Biden said: "We know the job before us is hard.
But we know that we can meet the challenge because I have said before, as this summit has shown, democracy is everywhere.
Authoritarian regimes will never be able to extinguish the tiny flame of freedom that burns in the hearts and minds of people all over the world. ”
Biden also said that defending democracy requires the efforts of the whole society.
He said: "As leaders of the government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, to strengthen the shield of democracy, to promote reform, to achieve transparent accountability governance, and to be more resistant to the buffers and shocks of authoritarianism and those who want to pursue power nakedly before the public interest. "
The second day of the Democracy Summit will focus on defending human rights, consolidating democracy and countering authoritarianism, and countering digital authoritarianism and affirming democratic values.
This day is International Human Rights Day.
UN Secretary-General António Guterres also spoke at the opening of the day, saying that democracy is facing challenges around the world, especially the challenges brought by new digital technologies.
He said: "Now is the time to reaffirm common values and positions and the resilience of democracy.
This requires deepening social dialogue, addressing inequality, fighting corruption, updating the social contract, investing in quality education, and expanding opportunities for women and girls.
This also requires a firm condemnation of all forms of populism, nationalism and extremism, including the use of all the tools provided by the technological revolution. "
Hong Kong democracy and human rights activist Lo Kuan-chung gave a speech through a pre-recorded video at the summit, reminding the participants to continue to pay attention to the human rights situation of Hong Kong and Chinese minority groups such as Uighurs and Tibetans.
He said: "For a long time, the world has been directly affected by China's rise, but there is no mechanism to hold China accountable.
That's why politicians and civil society leaders must work together.
We must use all the resources we have to ensure that the restoration of democracy is our top priority. ”
Lo Kuan-chung also called on the free world to unite to fight the threat of the Chinese Communist Party.
He said: "Maybe some of you are afraid of offending the General Secretary of the Communist Party of China, maybe some of you don't want to lose the Chinese market, maybe some of you don't realize the threat to our democratic values posed by the CPC.
And that's why we failed.
That's why we have to change. "
Taiwan's Executive Vice Minister of the Ministry of the Interior, Tang Feng, released a video statement at a roundtable discussion on "Fighting Digital Dictatorship and Affirming the Value of Democracy" to emphasize that Taiwan is at the forefront of the fight against tyranny and authoritarianism.
He also shared his experience in fighting the COVID-19 pandemic through information transparency and building trust.
He said: "As Taiwan's democracy is on the rise, we have always stood at the forefront of the global fight against authoritarianism and played a leading role in promoting global freedom, democracy and human rights.
During the pandemic, authoritarian governments around the world have justified human rights violations in the name of public health and the common good, and global democracy has shown signs of backsliding.
However, in Taiwan, we can control the epidemic without closing the city, and we can defeat fake information without removing it. ”
At the same time, the U.S. Treasury Department announced the imposition of sanctions on 15 individuals and 10 entities in several countries, including China and North Korea, for serious violations of human rights, and the imposition of investment restrictions on a Chinese company suspected of using surveillance technology to commit human rights abuses.

I know.
But the restaurant doesn't know why it keeps pushing back the delivery time.
It was supposed to be #NUMBER#
Well, I'm not calling.
Don't eat it

Why didn't you tell me earlier that you couldn't send it?
I waited so long for you.
No, I didn't get a call.

Why not cancel?
Hello, the chicken soup from the restaurant is fresh
I wanted to try tennis, but I was afraid I wouldn't be able to stick with it, so I wanted to try something similar in price first.
In fact, the price tends to be proportional to the friendliness, and if you can't tell the difference, then the expensive ones will be friendlier than the cheap ones, which are actually industrial garbage.
They are very weak, and the ball hits the beat, and the vibration is very large. The hard ball cannot hold it, and the experts are very difficult to control.
The logic and subtext of their existence is that - tennis is so hard, you know you can't learn it, you know you can't afford to buy the expensive stuff, so you play it twice, you won't play it again, so the racket is cheap, you don't feel bad.
When you can tell the difference between good and bad, that means you have progressed, and then I will come back here and buy the expensive ones, and I will make twice the money.
It is recommended to spend the same amount of money to buy a second-hand racket that is a little better, choose Prince or Dunlop, these two brands are not well-known, so the good racket does not sell for a high price, and a new racket of 500 or 600 is good. The second-hand racket of 200 is not bad, and you can enjoy the joy of a thousand-yuan racket.
It is very friendly to beginners, but after the beginner stage, it is useless, but most people, especially girls, cannot pass the beginner stage.
The order has been delayed several times in delivery time
Can you follow up on this?
Postponed
Thank you
That is to say, I actually have credit?
Do I need to place another order? Did I not need to pay attention to that order?

They have finished their work.

Please give a reasonable explanation

In fact, there are many things to consider when dressing a skinny girl.
Fat girls should not wear skirts that are too short or too long, and the length should be about knee-length, just enough to cover the fat parts of the thighs.
If the skirt is too short, the fat on the legs will be exposed.
Overlong will make you feel short and fat.
If you wear it out in three parts, it will make you look taller, that is, the upper body, the skirt and the long stockings are different colors, which will produce a sense of elongation.
In fact, many dark-colored clothes are the must-haves of skinny girls (the author knows this very well), and dark colors are also a good way to cover up your body fat, and black short skirts are the first choice for skinny girls.
Wearing deep-colored clothes, especially black short skirts, will make you look thinner.
If your calves are big, don't wear shoes or socks that draw too much attention.
The more popular the better, and the colors should not be too bright.
To avoid people feeling fat when they look at your legs and feet.
For the slightly chubby girls, it is necessary to talk about the tricks of dressing and matching.
Don't wear tight shorts, don't wear shorts that are too short, don't wear shorts that are too tight, don't wear shorts that are too tight, don't wear shorts that are too tight, don't wear shorts that are too tight, don't wear shorts that are too tight, don't wear shorts that are too tight, don't wear shorts that are too tight, don't wear shorts that are too tight, don't wear shorts that are too tight, don't wear shorts that are too tight, don't wear shorts that are too tight, don't wear shorts that are too tight, don't wear shorts that are too tight, don't wear shorts that are too tight, don't wear shorts that are too tight, don't wear shorts that are too tight, don't wear shorts that are too tight, don't wear shorts that are too tight, don't wear shorts that are too tight, don't wear shorts that are too tight, don't wear shorts that are too tight, don't wear shorts that are too tight, don't wear shorts that are too tight, don't wear shorts that are too tight
Of course, skinny girls should also pay attention when wearing short skirts.
Fat girls should choose tops with the same color as the short skirt, so that the fat body will have the effect of increasing the height.
Short skirts paired with high heels can make your legs look more slender, which is the most popular combination in summer!
If you are a fat person with thin legs, it is recommended that you choose a gorgeous dress with a short skirt.
It not only covers your belly, but also shows your advantages.
The A-line short skirt is very slim, and it is more suitable for fat girls. The top should choose a tight-fitting one to form a sense of layering.
A simple white T-shirt matched with a short skirt, the fat MM can also try.
Skinny girls can also be fashionable.
As long as you can master the rules of dressing and matching, the skinny girls will also be the focus of the crowd.
After changing the way of dressing and matching, it is also necessary to exercise more in life, and strive to get rid of the label of the micro-fat girl as soon as possible😄

Girl shoots arrows to raise money for her sister: "It's just a flesh wound" - Xinhua News Agency
A girl stands in front of a large wooden board in Wulin Square in Hangzhou, with the words "human meat target, ten yuan per arrow" written on it.
Yesterday morning, a photo of a “girl in Hangzhou” donating to her sister went viral on social media.
The photo shows a girl standing in front of a wooden board that is slightly higher than a person in Hangzhou's Wulin Square, with the words "human meat target, ten yuan per arrow" written on it, indicating that passers-by can use a bow and arrow to shoot after paying.
The incident has sparked a heated discussion among netizens.
Last night, the publicity officer of the Lower City Branch of the Public Security Bureau of Hangzhou City confirmed to the reporter of Xinjing that the police confirmed that the girl had made such a violent act to raise money for her sister, but this kind of behavior should not be encouraged, and the girl left the local police station yesterday after being warned.
Girl on street 'arrow target' pleads guilty to fundraising
In the picture, a long-haired girl stood in front of a large wooden board, and the black ink on the board wrote "human meat target, ten yuan per shot" and her bank account, WeChat and Alipay account on the other wooden board in front of her.
The picture sparked controversy after it was posted online.
Some netizens thought that this was a "begging for eyeballs" behavior, and many netizens expressed sympathy for this.
"We found the situation when we were patrolling the square around 10 a.m. on the 23rd. The crowd had already gathered around the square. "
When interviewed by local media at the scene of the incident, the police officers at the Tian Shui police station nearby said that there were two girls, both in their 20s, who were dressed in a youthful and beautiful manner.
Among them, the girl who played the "human target" has been crying, begging passers-by to play this game; the other girl is helping to shout on the side, saying that her friend's sister has leukemia and is in urgent need of surgery. Please help.
"We have contacted the local police in Guizhou and learned that the girl was raising money for her sister's leukemia treatment. "
Last night, the head of publicity for the Lower City Branch of the Hangzhou Public Security Bureau told the reporter from Xinjing that the girl's name was Jijiali, and she was collecting donations for her sister Jijiali.
But since the treatment still costs more than $30,000, I couldn't think of a good way to raise money, so I did this.
He said that during the whole process, two girls were targets, one was responsible for shooting, but did not participate in it, and no one shot arrows during the whole process, only someone watched and took photos and posted them on Weibo.
Police later determined that the bow used was not controlled.
The official said, "It is not advocated to take this kind of eye-catching fundraising."
After being warned by the police station, she left the police station.

What is the most popular thing in 2021?
It is undoubtedly the Tokyo Olympics.
Do you think only Olympians can win medals?
Some time ago, there was an article called "Take a look! Project managers can beat the gold medal in the Olympic project" which was very popular. The article mentioned that project managers can absolutely beat the gold medal in many projects: moving bricks, going on business trips, and staying up late are the daily routines of project managers. Firefighting, taking the blame, and apologizing are not even mentioned.
The article, which seems to be a joke, also reveals the daily bitterness of project managers, which is represented by the lack of enthusiasm for current project management work.
And the people who are engaged in project management are gradually choosing to get out of the predicament of their work through some actions.
As the number of PMP (Project Management Professional) applicants has been increasing every year, more and more project managers are improving their project management skills through learning.
According to the China Project Management Development Report (1999-2019), as of September 2019, the total number of PMP® applicants in the country was nearly 6 million, and the number of PMP® certified persons was about 420,000, and the number of valid certificates was about 300,000, accounting for 31.2% of the total number of PMP® certificates in the world.
Over the past 10 years, the number of PMP holders has been increasing year by year, indicating that more and more project managers have realized that it is not advisable to do things by simply copying the old experience, and the changing work environment tells us that we need to learn to stand on the shoulders of scientific giants and explore the way forward.
However, can PMP guarantee the smooth running of project management work?
Many project management beginners said that by learning related courses such as PMP/IPMP, they can systematically master the top ten fields and five process groups of project management, but they are still in a fog when actually doing project management work.
Many project managers often feedback the following problems: lack of project management knowledge, relying solely on personal experience, empty project management theory, do not know how to practice; lack of systematic project management process system support, unable to land in the work, project estimates are not accurate, control sensitivity is poor, the project is dragged back and forth; unclear division of labor, the old oil man in the team does not know how to deal with it; cross-departmental assistance communication is not smooth, the project is difficult to move forward...
Therefore, focusing on product innovation and R&D management for more than ten years, it has helped many excellent enterprises to cultivate a large number of product managers, project managers and other R&D key talents, and has received the honorary titles of "China Enterprise R&D Management Talent Training Demonstration Base" and "China Summer Consulting" with the "R&D Project Manager Training Camp" online course.
The online training course of "Project Manager Training Camp" is a kind of online fragmented learning, which combines the practical cases, tools and methods of many R&D enterprises, and helps you master the essential knowledge and standard actions of project managers, and take the path of self-management of project management.
This is also an opportunity for companies to use lower costs and less investment to promote the development of project managers, and to achieve efficient operation results.
The course is not only taught by the expert team of Zhongtian Huaxia (the original Huawei R&D management team), but also combines the international advanced project management theories and the real business scenarios of many well-known enterprises, and deeply explains the course content in an easy-to-understand manner.
It will also provide scientific and practical management tools and methods, rich templates and forms, and help students convert what they have learned into specific work after class.

JTCN advocates rational consumption before the 12.12 - Economic Observer Network - Professional Financial News Website
This year, the “Double Eleven” carnival of the national network payment business transaction amount reached 1.77 trillion yuan, which was higher than that of the previous year.
The variety of performances and the eye-catching red envelopes have once again made consumers exclaim that they have benefited from the live broadcast of the red envelopes. On the one hand, it makes people sigh that the national consumption power is becoming stronger and stronger. On the other hand, it is necessary to calm down and think about the impact of consumerism on society and the mainstream consumer group in contemporary society.
Before the arrival of Double 12, Jingxin Consumer Financial Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as “Jingxin”) issued a rational consumption advocacy, reminding the general public, especially young people, to establish good consumption awareness and consumption habits, and reject blind consumption and excessive consumption.
According to the results of the Consumer Financial Literacy Survey and Analysis Report released by the People's Bank of China this year, the national consumer financial literacy index is 66.81, which is 2.04 higher than that of 2019.
In general, the performance of Chinese residents in the aspect of financial consumption is good, but there is a large difference in the aspects of financial behavior and skills, and the level of basic financial knowledge needs to be further improved.
The financial literacy level of the elderly and young people is relatively low, and “one old and one young” will still be the focus of financial education. The Nielsen report on the debt situation of young people and the report on the 2019-2020 China Youth Consumption Report released by CCTV Finance show that the young generation has huge consumption potential, and credit consumption has become an important way to upgrade consumption. 86.6% of young people are using credit products, and nearly half of them do not have debt accumulation. Although the young generation as a whole shows a trend of rational consumption, it is far away from the label of “overspending” by the outside world, but some young people do have overconsumption and imitation consumption behaviors, and they have accumulated a lot of financial pressure and debt risk, and even caused social problems to increase gradually. Financial enterprises should actively assume social responsibilities and carry out positive guidance.
As a licensed consumer financial institution, Jincheng has always been committed to helping people build their own happy life with high-quality and considerate services, advocating that consumers establish good and correct consumption concepts, and actively respond to regulatory calls to improve the rational consumption awareness of consumers, especially young people, through practical actions.
In the past few years, ZTE has carried out comprehensive and diversified financial knowledge popularization activities for young people, including college students, through cooperation with domestic top universities to carry out innovative practice competitions and other forms of subtle guidance for young people's consumption needs, so as to help them establish rational consumption concepts, rationally plan their consumption needs, and thus help them accumulate wealth in their lives.
As the 12th comes, Jingxin reminds all consumer friends to establish reasonable consumer awareness and correct money views, resist blind consumption and overconsumption, avoid the consumer credit and economic life mistakes, so as not to affect personal credit and future economic life.
It is important to plan in advance when you are going to spend, and to pay back on time.
If it is overdue, the overdue record will be recorded in the individual credit report, which may have a negative impact on the purchase of a car and the purchase of a house in the future.
At the same time, when enjoying financial products and services, one should choose the regular institutions and channels, and pay attention to check whether the relevant institutions have the qualification to operate.
In the future, ZTE will continue to rely on its mature and reliable consumer finance system and continuously updated and upgraded financial products to provide consumers with more suitable and diversified services, and help consumers cultivate the concept of rational consumption and moderate borrowing, and be a trusted consumer finance partner for consumers for life.

Vietnam People's Daily - Gulf Cooperation Council responds to common challenges
The stops for Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman include Oman, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, Bahrain and Kuwait.
It is noteworthy that this is the first visit by the Crown Prince to Qatar since Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies imposed an embargo on Qatar in mid-2017, which led to the Gulf diplomatic crisis.
In the midst of the crisis, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt cut diplomatic ties with Qatar and imposed a total embargo, accusing Qatar of supporting terrorist groups and having close ties with Iran.
The diplomatic tensions have seriously affected the internal unity of the Hague Conference, and have had a negative impact on the economic development of the countries in the region.
Four Arab nations have closed land, sea and air routes to Qatar.
The crisis was only resolved at the Gulf Cooperation Council summit in January 2021, when the Gulf states signed a deal brokered by the United States and Kuwait to move towards "unity and stability."
Saudi Arabia has reopened its border with Qatar.
Saudi Arabia and Egypt are leading efforts to restore ties with Qatar by appointing new ambassadors in Qatar first.
The Gulf Arab states have resolved their differences to restore relations with Qatar in order to meet the requirement to unite for the interests of the countries and regional stability, in order to face common challenges.
During the visit of the Saudi Crown Prince to Oman, the two sides agreed to open the first direct land link between the two Gulf neighbors.
The 725-kilometer channel connecting the two countries will provide convenient conditions for citizens of both countries to travel and integrate the supply chain.
The Saudi Arabian Public Investment Fund (PIF) will invest $5 billion in Oman, and 13 cooperation memorandums of understanding worth $30 billion have been signed between the two countries.
Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's visit to the Gulf coincides with Iran's negotiations with world powers to save the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), an agreement condemned by Gulf Arab states for failing to resolve their missile problem with Iran.
The Gulf states have long viewed Iran as a long-term "competitor" and its nuclear program as a "threat" to regional security.
Gulf states believe that not addressing the Iranian missile issue and not taking action to curb Iran's activities in the region is flawed.
In the background of the failure of the nuclear negotiations between Saudi Arabia and Iran to meet the aspirations of the Gulf states, Saudi Arabia and Iran held direct talks.
Its aim is to contain the escalation of tensions in the region.
It is one of the factors that are slowing down economic growth in Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries.
The upcoming GCC summit will be the first summit since the end of the dispute between some member states and Qatar.
This is an opportunity to re-evaluate the diplomatic achievements that have contributed to promoting the unification of the Gulf Cooperation Council, while proposing measures to fully cooperate with its member states to address common challenges and contribute to the stability and development of Gulf states.

This car that our team has brought to you this time is the dream of many men!
It's the flagship supercar of Lamborghini, the replacement for the Murcielago, the Aventador LP700-4!
The price is more than two million dollars, and the annual road tax is more than ten thousand dollars, and it has four-wheel drive. Why is it called LP700?
With 700 horsepower, can you imagine how fast it is?
Well, I don't know, the data says that it only takes 2.9 seconds to accelerate from 0 to 100 km/h, which is probably myvi's myvi to reach 30 km/h when people reach 100 km/h.
The low-slung body, the arrogant scissor doors, the huge air intakes all over the body and the glass-enclosed 6.5 V12 engine perfectly illustrate the style of Lamborghini.
There is not much to say about the description of the car, just Google it yourself, and we have collected some of the explanations that Google doesn't give.
Too much to see, wherever you go, it doesn't feel right. (It's kind of cool though.)
1km oil change costs around RM1 (owners don't care)
Practice getting in and out of the car, otherwise it can be a bit awkward (because you can't climb out of the car and get stuck halfway)
The engine is so loud that it deafens you when you get out of the car. (But it's totally worth it.)
The car is too big to park in a normal parking space, and it's very afraid of being knocked by the neighbor's car when it opens the door!
A bit lonely because there are no opponents on the road (I myself said this, and it has nothing to do with the car owner, haha)
Don't get me wrong, this supercar is not for sale, sorry!

Let the spirit of the university resonate with the spirit of the times - Xinhua News Agency
The spirit of a university refers to a series of educational concepts and values that have been accumulated over a long period of time in the development of a university, and is the soul of the university.
From ancient times to the present, the spirit of the university has been of great importance to the development of politics, economy, culture, science and technology, as well as the progress of a nation.
From the birth of the world's first modern university, the university has carried out a unique mission that is different from other social organizations. For our universities, the rise in the autumn of national crisis, its spirit is deeply influenced by traditional culture and the changes of the times, advocating the value concept of "righteousness for the world and peace for the world" and the patriotic responsibility of "strengthening the country and developing the country".
At present, the trend of informationization and internationalization of higher education is becoming more and more obvious, the global education competition, technology competition and talent competition are constantly intensifying, and higher education as an important "supply side" is facing unprecedented opportunities and challenges in structural reform.
In particular, the proposal of the “Overall Plan for Promoting the Construction of World-Class Universities and First-Class Disciplines” has not only shown the confidence and determination of our country to move from a major country in higher education to a major country in higher education, but also put forward higher and more updated requirements for the development of universities.
How to make efforts in a short period of time to enter the world's top 100 list, and accelerate the construction of several world-class universities and a number of world-class disciplines on the basis of a certain gap, and achieve “overtaking the bend ” ?
In addition to the confidence in the goal, the confidence in the path and the confidence in the ability, colleges and universities should fully play the three advantages: the first is the advantage of latecomers, through the continuous introduction of outstanding academic talents from abroad, learning from the advanced experience of the world's first-class universities, to achieve significant improvement in academic level and quality of education; the second is the cultural advantage, inheriting the wisdom of Chinese civilization accumulated in five thousand years, promoting the development of excellent traditional culture, so as to consolidate the power, shape the brand, and improve the image; the third is the advantage of the system, taking advantage of the superiority of the socialist country's system, strengthening the goal-driven, gathering consensus and working together to optimize the allocation of resources, so as to provide a sustainable solid guarantee for the school to accelerate the catch up with the world's advanced level.
In particular, it is necessary to realize that it is impossible to build a world-class university with one school in a thousand schools, and each school must highlight its own advantages and characteristics at the same time.
The characteristics of education should both have the common Chinese characteristics and reflect the unique target positioning, school tradition and resource endowment of each school.
As for Zhejiang University, we focus on three aspects in our education: one is to highlight the characteristics of cultivating innovative and entrepreneurial talents, build an integrated education environment of interdisciplinary integration and school-enterprise integration, and form a full chain of entrepreneurship education ecosystem; two is to highlight the characteristics of cross-disciplinary aggregation, promote the optimization and adjustment of the discipline system, create an institutional environment for cross-disciplinary integration, and actively cultivate cross-new disciplines and iconic cross-disciplinary achievements; three is to highlight the characteristics of the school system and social service, carry out in-depth international exchange and cooperation, and accelerate the formation of a pan-ZJU cooperation system.
In this process, it is particularly important to always adhere to the spirit of the university, and let the spirit of the university resonate with the spirit of the times.
For Zhejiang University, the spirit of the school is the latest expression system of the spirit of Zhejiang University, which is based on the common values of innovation, “seeking truth from facts”, “hard work, moral education, clear thinking, and hard work”, and the common values of “embracing the Yangtze River, opening up the truth, opening up the people, and building the country”.
This is an important guarantee for the school to adhere to the correct direction of education, to continuously accumulate cultural height, to consolidate spiritual strength, and to have a rich connotation and far-reaching significance.
Among them, “Haina River River” emphasizes the spirit of openness and inclusiveness, which embodies the spirit of “using the genius of the world for my own use”, and is manifested in the pursuit of high-quality ideas of education and research of world-class universities; “Qi Zhen Houde” emphasizes the spirit of seeking truth and goodness, which means that the university should not only pursue the truth, but also be willing to accept the spirit of virtue and the spirit of personality training; “Open before the people” reflects the spirit of reform and innovation, which includes both the pursuit of knowledge and the innovation of scientific research, and also represents the reform and development of the revolution; “Tree my country and my country” emphasizes the spirit of patriotism, which means that the university should always be associated with the fate and glory of the nation.
This series of spiritual concepts and values is the soul of Zhejiang University's 120 years of education.
"The wise hear the silence, and the wise see the unseen."
Chinese universities should further stand on the global socialist cause with Chinese characteristics, deeply grasp the era and historical mission of higher education, and accelerate the construction of world-class universities.
At the same time, adhering to humanistic care and independent freedom, let the spirit of the university and the spirit of the times, the spirit of the nation, and the common ideal of mankind are mutually stimulated, so as to provide inexhaustible impetus for the realization of national strength and national rejuvenation, and the realization of the common ideal of mankind.

As the NFT craze is in full swing, the crypto community has come up with a new concept.
In 2021, a blockchain game called Axie Infinity had a huge impact in Southeast Asia, with some residents who lost their jobs due to the pandemic starting to earn a stable income from the game.
Axie Infinity is a pet-raising game based on blockchain technology, which combines a variety of gameplay including NFTs, and is currently the highest-grossing NFT project, with over $3 billion in transactions to date.
According to TokenTerminal data, Axie Infinity's daily income exceeded $82 million, and it was approaching "League of Legends."
On August 6, Axie Infinity announced that its daily active users exceeded 1 million.
The excitement of Axie Infinity has passed on a new "palytoearn" mode to more people, through the help of blockchain and smart contracts, players are no longer a single role, in addition to getting pleasure and economic benefits from the game, they can also participate in the governance of the game ecosystem.
This sovereignty is not granted by the game production company, but is guaranteed by blockchain technology.
Seeing the news about the share price of a friend, my biggest impression is that enterprises should first choose the industries with large growth space, at least with a market size of more than 100 billion; secondly, they should choose the industries with good growth potential, and consider the industries with the best growth potential in the next 3-5 years; finally, they should choose the industries with policy support.
The width of the track refers to the market size, the length of the track refers to the development stage of the industry, and the flatness or ruggedness of the track refers to the competitive pattern of the industry.
Fuel up for the right track!
The first thing in the new year is to summarize the adjustment of 2021 and adjust the 2022 tactical layout.
The tactic is to "do the things right," which means doing things the right way.
The strategy is to "do the right thing," which is to do the right thing.
The strategy is to find the direction, and the tactics are to land, and there is room for strategic thinking on top of most tactical thinking.
For example, how to increase the number of customers (tactical thinking) can think about whether to deepen the current field or expand horizontally (strategic thinking); for example, how to improve customer retention rate (tactical thinking) can think about how to improve the retention rate of core customers and high-value customers (strategic thinking); for example, how to improve the participation rate of activities (tactical thinking) can think about how to set the correct activity KPIs to achieve the correct activity goals, such as improving the participation rate of target customers, activating high-value silent customers, and accurately attracting new customers; for example, how to improve DAU (tactical thinking) can think about whether the current growth is healthy and sustainable.
Bitcoin has been around for 12 years and has seen several milestones in 2021.
On September 7, the small Central American country of El Salvador made bitcoin legal tender, making it the first country or region to make bitcoin legal tender.
On October 12, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved ProShares to launch a bitcoin ETF for the first time in eight years, and listed it on the New York Stock Exchange, marking the first regulated bitcoin futures ETF to land in the U.S. capital market, and further expanding the investment scope of the cryptocurrency market.
From the perspective of the development of blockchain technology, Bitcoin is not the protagonist.
On November 14, 2021, Bitcoin underwent a soft fork upgrade called “Taproot”, which improved the anonymity of Bitcoin network transactions and reduced the data burden of transactions by changing the data structure of the block itself.

Asian-American groups complain of discrimination at 3 Ivy League schools - Xinhua News Agency
The Chinese News Agency Washington, May 23 (Reporter Xu Jianmei) - 130 Asian-American groups submitted a complaint to the U.S. Department of Education and the U.S. Department of Justice on May 23, protesting discrimination against Asian-American applicants in the admissions process at three Ivy League schools - - Yale University, Brown University and Dartmouth College.
The Asian American Education Alliance, which filed the complaint, held a press conference in Washington on the same day.
The group's chairman, Zhao Yuxuan, said that over the past 10 years, the number of Asian applicants who meet the admission requirements of prestigious American universities has more than doubled, but the proportion of Asian applicants at the three prestigious American universities has remained at the same level.
Many studies have shown that these colleges discriminate against Asian applicants in the so-called "holistic" admissions process.
Zhao Yuankang introduced that the research of Sanders et al. in 2014 showed that in the three universities, the acceptance rate of Asian students was the lowest relative to the number of applicants among all ethnic groups.
The U.S. Department of Education's data also shows that Brown University and Dartmouth College have the lowest acceptance rates for Asian students among all Ivy League schools, and Yale University and Brown University have implemented de facto racial quotas for Asian applicants for more than 20 years.
Zhao Yuankang told Xinhua News Agency reporters that they hope that after the complaint is submitted, the U.S. Department of Education and the Department of Justice will conduct an investigation and take measures to prevent these universities from discriminating against Asians in admissions.
They also hope that the universities that have been complained about will take the initiative to pay attention to this issue and change their admissions policies for Asian students.
The three schools have not yet responded to the complaint.
The Asian American Education Alliance was founded in 2015, and had previously filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education alleging discrimination at Harvard University, but the department rejected the complaint on procedural grounds.
In addition to the Chinese-American group, the complaint also includes Indian-American, Korean-American, Japanese-American, and Pakistani-American education groups.

There's a hotline for ordering food, and they don't know what they're talking about
Is there a phone number to contact them directly?
In September 2020, Mr. Lu learned from a real estate agent that a factory located in Zhuting Town, Yueyang, Zhejiang Province. After several on-site visits, Mr. Lu decided to purchase the factory.
In December of the same year, Mr. Lu negotiated with the family of the owner of the factory house and transferred 200,000 yuan by bank transfer on the same day.
Lin signed as the receiver on the receipt for the deposit for the sale of the factory, which stated that if the buyer did not want to buy the factory, the deposit would be returned to the seller, and if the seller did not want to sell the factory, the deposit would be returned twice to the seller, and the parties agreed to sign the contract for the sale of the factory within a week.
However, after the two sides failed to reach an agreement on the main contract terms such as the sale of the factory premises and the payment method, the house purchase contract was delayed for a long time.
After a few days, Lin returned the 200,000 yuan deposit to Mr. Lu.
After a long wait, the house was finally seen, the deposit was paid, and the house price was ready to go, but the contract was not signed, and the seller did not sell, which made Mr. Lu helpless and angry.
For this reason, Mr. Lu filed a lawsuit against Mr. Lin to the Yueyang City People's Court.
The court considered that the parties failed to sign a formal contract, and could not be held solely responsible for the defendant, so this case should not apply the penalty clause of the deposit, and the defendant is not liable for the double return of the deposit.
The plaintiff appealed after the first judgment.
Recently, the Second Court of Appeals upheld the original judgment.
【Lawyers remind】 During the transaction, it is necessary to pay attention to the necessary precautions.
At the time of signing the contract, as a buyer, it is necessary to take necessary precautions, such as verifying the information of the owner of the house, whether the house is occupied, and other relevant information, and clearly specify the specific time and place of delivery in the contract to avoid disputes between the parties when performing the contract.
(Deutsche Welle China) On Friday, China's Foreign Ministry spokesperson said that the United States held the "Summit of Leaders of the People's Republic of China" to "ideologically delineate, instrumentalize and weaponize democracy, and act against the reality of democracy in the name of pseudo-democracy, incite division and confrontation, and divert domestic contradictions."
The Chinese government believes that "for a long time, the United States has imposed its political system and value concepts on people, implemented the "democratic reform", abused unilateral sanctions, and instigated the "color revolution" to cause disastrous consequences.
"Democracy" has long been a "weapon of mass destruction" used by the United States to interfere in other countries.
The summit is a fulfillment of Biden's campaign promise.
The two-day meeting was held in video format, and leaders from 111 countries around the world were invited, including leaders from Taiwan, but China and Russia were not invited.
Before the summit, China and Russia criticized the United States for the problem of democracy in its own country, saying that the United States is not qualified to host such a summit.
There are also voices of doubt internationally and in the United States, such as criticism of the leaders invited to the summit, including some leaders with authoritarian tendencies, such as the leaders of the Philippines, Poland and Brazil, who doubt that the real intention of the Biden government is to organize the summit for democracy, but for geopolitical purposes.
Newly appointed German Chancellor Scholz also attended the video democracy summit
China's Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Saturday that "today's American democracy is sick, and the problems of money politics, identity politics, party rivalry, political polarization, social division, racial conflict, and the gap between rich and poor are becoming more and more severe," and that American democracy is a "rich man's game" based on capital.
In his speech, President Biden said, "As leaders of government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, to strengthen the guardrails of democracy, to push for reform, to achieve transparency and accountability, to be more resilient to the forces of authoritarianism, and to those who want to pursue power nakedly before the public interest. "
He stressed that democracy is not something that is taken for granted, "we have to keep updating it in every generation, and in my view, this is the defining challenge of our time."
Biden also said that global democracy and human rights "are under continued and alarming threat" and that democracy needs heroes to defend it.
The United States has promised to launch a year-long campaign following the Democracy Summit, including a $4.244 billion initiative to strengthen democracy around the world and support independent news media.
The United States hopes that countries will make specific public commitments before the real democracy summit to be held at the end of 2022 to improve their democratic systems.
Biden said, "Let's all countries implement our commitments and report on our progress next year."
Well, I'm afraid he sent the wrong address.
Jichang Restaurant (Wudaoqiao Store)
[Mint] Environment: Average [service bell] Service: The dishes are served very quickly. "Gufamala Gao" is my must-order dish. The Gufamala Gao is too sweet and too soft to eat. 😋 The little ones who like desserts must try the "Dongjiang Mushi Slimy Tofu Soup". The soup is very fresh and the tofu is very tender.

It has been a long time since I came to Changsha, and the fruit is still so good to drink and the real ingredients are enough, and the first time I ordered a roast pork bun, it is the southern taste of soft flour that I love!
The chicken rice is just right, the portion is very sufficient, the signature tin paper chicken wings are as good as ever, the soup is also good, and the treatment of the lemongrass is also quite...
The taste is good, the service is enthusiastic, and the meat is good.
The old store of Jinchang is also a popular place many years ago, and the Dongshan Xiao Lou, the wooden floor.
It is always a long wait at the door to eat the claypot rice, and the claypots are all cracked...
It has been a long time since I have eaten at Dayang. The rise of various small shops selling Cantonese cuisine has dispersed the flow of customers.

What is the red card whiskey?
Everyone has different tastes, some people like to collect, some people like to eat, of course, some people like to drink, and red label whisky is one of the most popular Scottish whiskies in the world, and the red label whisky has won the gold medal at the International Wine and Spirit Competition.
Each bottle of red whisky has its own unique taste, but if you don't know how to taste it, you're wasting its richness.
So how do you drink a red card whiskey?
Here is a brief introduction for you.
Red Card Whiskey:
The Johnnie Walker Red Label is a blend of approximately 35 different Scotch whiskies, with a rich aroma and traditional Scotch whisky characteristics, with a sweet and smoky aroma.
The entry is fresh and slightly herbal with a strong malty tobacco finish.
The wine can be drunk straight from the bottle or mixed with your favorite drink.
Red whisky entered the country, and in order to adapt to the taste of the Chinese people, Red whisky + cola or Sprite or new spirit became a fashion that lasted for a long time.
These sweet drinks can not only neutralize the sour taste, but also visually bring a pleasant feeling when added to the drink, and have the effect of lightening the taste and changing the taste of the drink.
Red wine + lemon slices + sugar (sugar can also be used) is the most authentic and traditional way to drink it.
The original red wine tastes a little sour, and adding sugar can neutralize the sour taste. Lemon will give the wine a fresh fragrance, of course, the sweetness can be adjusted according to personal taste.
The above three are the best ways to drink red-card whiskey, and you can try them as a reference, hoping that my introduction can help you.
Educational thinking: How college exams can make “scholars” and “ignorant” each get what they deserve - Xinhua News Agency
Three Lanzhou Jiaotong University students wrote letters to the school leaders to reflect their confusion about the university exam, and proposed to increase the difficulty of the exam, change the exam questions, and make the exam truly reflect the actual level of students.
Indeed, for a long time, university exams have been a "hot topic."
In the university campus, students come from all over the country, with different levels of ability, and varying degrees of learning.
It is inevitable that there are different feelings when assessing a group with such a diverse feature.
Of course, if the test questions are single and repetitive, and the questions are too simple, it is inevitable that another different feeling will be caused.
Students who do not do their homework may be able to pass the exam by focusing on it before the exam, and if they think of other ways, they may be able to achieve the effect of doubling their efforts.
In this way, there is a “dumb student” who can pass the exam even if he doesn’t put in effort during the day, and even get a high score; and there is a “smart student” who never misses class, the homework and notes are all good, and the exam is not much higher than the “strange situation”.
It seems that the Lanzhou Jiaotong University students' reflections on the problems in the university exam are not without reason, and this situation is not limited to Lanzhou Jiaotong University.
In this sense, the three students who wrote letters directly to Mr. Chen are worthy of praise.
In fact, people who have gone to university know that it is not uncommon for people to try to get exam questions from teachers in all sorts of ways, to try to get the scope of the exam, and to get “key tutoring” before the exam. Even in the exam, it is not uncommon for people to sneak in small notes and ask the teacher to raise their hands after the exam.
In my opinion, as a teaching quality evaluation guide, the evaluation of whether a university's exam is qualified or not is more about teachers' comprehensive grasp of teaching and learning, and scientific questions based on this.
When entering the undergraduate stage, the major begins to be subdivided, and many major courses are based on basic knowledge.
It is certain that whether or not to master the basic knowledge points of a subject is the content of the university examination.
Undergraduate knowledge is basically the basic theory and basic common sense of the discipline, and the change space is not large, which is basically fixed.
Like what the teachers said, "I learned the basic knowledge of mathematics 20 years ago, and I am still learning it now, and it is a focus. "
But the knowledge points are basically the same, and it does not mean that the test type is single and the test is repeated.
In many universities, the examination is usually organized into a group of examiners, and then the senior teachers of the subject are responsible for the compilation of the examination papers, and the examination papers are also reviewed by all the teachers of the subject, so that the repetition of the examination papers can be avoided to a certain extent.
However, in order to formulate a set of test questions that are in line with the actual situation of teaching and learning, the difficulty of the questions should be normal, and the teaching situation should be comprehensively mastered, and the degree of student learning should be comprehensively analyzed, so that the exam questions can have a dynamic grasp of difficulty and type, and can both highlight the examination of basic knowledge and cover the examination of ability, and at the same time innovate the design of the questions.
Exams are the steering wheel of university education, and what kind of exam students will have corresponding preparation plans, and in the long run, will affect the effectiveness of university education.
The Lanzhou University of Technology highly values the advice letters from students, and has deployed a rectification plan in the whole school.
Require all teaching units to organize teachers to conduct self-examination and compare the results of the course completion examination with the exam papers, and formulate exam papers and related systems. At the same time, strengthen the supervision and inspection of the exam papers and review links, and refine the assessment of grades, and strengthen the comprehensive assessment of all aspects of course teaching.
From a mechanism point of view, it is an issue that needs to be faced by university examination affairs, of course, it needs to issue corresponding regulations, but the effort is in daily life, and the teacher needs to have a comprehensive grasp of the teaching situation, not only to understand the teaching content, but also to understand the learning situation of students, both of which need to be understood, and the teaching and learning will be better connected, and the exam will be more in line with reality, so that the "brainy" and the "stupid" can get their due.

The Kim wife's wedding photography (South Street store) has not yet opened a branch
Before the photo shoot, we didn't arrange the time well, so we changed the time twice. Lan Lan, the consultant, was very patient and arranged the time for us.
He later chose a weekend with good weather to take the photo.
Kim's staff, whether consultants, makeup artists, or photographers, are all top-notch.
That was my first time officially wearing makeup, wow, I can't believe that one day I will look like this, haha.
Xiao Jie and another sister (sorry I can't remember her name) are super patient with their make-up, and their make-up is very natural.
The exterior was filmed in Jiangwan City, and fortunately, the weather was good that day, and we didn't feel very cold when we took the photos. The make-up artist would occasionally check our clothes, headwear, and if anything was a little off, he would help us tidy it up.
The photographer was also very funny and made everyone feel very happy.
When choosing photos, because there are many cases on the Internet, we don't want to delete too many photos, but when we choose photos, really, there is no meaning to add photos at all, and the 24 photos in the package are not added at all (I heard that my cousin, who took wedding photos in the same time as me, spent more than 7,000 and added more than 10,000 photos in the package, and I was shocked at the time, and I was afraid that I would choose too many photos)
Today, the photo was fixed, and Lan Lan sent it to me. I saw two that were not good, and they immediately helped me fix them.
I think our photos are really good, simple and fresh, which is exactly what I wanted.
I sincerely recommend everyone to go to take wedding photos with Mrs. Chan Hung-yan!
The price of the set: 3999 yuan
Mrs. Kim thanks you sincerely for your kind wishes for her happiness and prosperity.
How much is this set?
What conditions must the $32 meet in order to be used?
That's fine, no refund needed
Your rider says he can't find it

3,200 newborn babies in Sabah without birth certificates due to lack of counterfeit paper
(Kuala Lumpur, Nov. 11) The National Registration Department of Sabah said that due to the shortage of special anti-counterfeiting paper, it has been unable to issue birth certificates to newborn babies since the beginning of October, and the cumulative number of affected people has reached 3,200.
However, director Keru Aminus assured that all babies who have applied for birth certificates have been recorded in the system and will be issued once the anti-counterfeiting paper arrives next week.
He explained at a press conference that the online media had been reporting on the problem of printing the Sabah newspaper for over 10 months.
He said the issue has been raised two months ago and Sarawak is also facing the same problem.
"One reason is that Chinese manufacturers who produce customized anti-counterfeiting paper have been affected by the epidemic, resulting in delays in delivery to our country. "
He explained that the anti-counterfeiting paper used in Sabah is different from that used in other states, and therefore cannot be borrowed from other states.
Keralamunis revealed that the latest batch of anti-counterfeiting paper arrived in Kuala Lumpur on the 6th of this month and was handed over to the printing company on the 8th for partial printing.
"The agency will send someone to pick up the goods in Kuala Lumpur on Thursday, and print the final stage immediately in Sabah, which is estimated to take 2 working days (December 20) to be delivered to the applicant. "
"We will notify applicants to go to the local branch to collect the application papers. "
He added that Sabah has issued 24,801 birth certificates this year.
From 7 p.m. to now
Is that about to happen?
I mean food
I'm across the street from #PRS_ORG
Well, thank you, because the restaurant says it's ready.

Education information: Beijing compresses the proportion of 2016 early middle school entrance special talents-Xinhua News Agency
On the 21st and 22nd, the special entrance examination for junior high school students in Beijing was organized and implemented by the teaching committee of each district.
This year, all districts in Beijing have reduced the proportion of special-admissions students, and the competition for special-admissions students has become more fierce.
For example, in the Eastern District, the proportion of primary and secondary school special talents admitted this year is generally not more than 5% of the total number of enrollments in the district, and the number of enrollments is 380, and the proportion of enrollment is not more than 10% of the number of enrollments in the school.
Students with sports, art, and technology specialties and who register online are eligible to take the special entrance examination.
In order to facilitate students to participate in the examination nearby, the Dongcheng District continued the examination arrangement of last year and set up 1-2 examination locations in each school district, with a total of 13 examination locations.
The examination points are divided according to the examination areas, and the examination time is divided into hours. On the day of the examination, students will enter the examination points in different examination rooms according to the examination time and take the examination.

The president of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina: I believe that China has the ability to hold the Winter Olympics in a special period - Xinhua News Agency
Xinhua News Agency Sarajewo, December 11 (Xinhua) - Bosnian Olympic Committee President Kvesic recently said that Bosnia is looking forward to the Beijing Winter Olympics and believes that China has the ability to hold the Winter Olympics in a special period.
China's ambassador to Bosnia and Herzegovina, Qi Ping, met with the president of the Bosnian Olympic Committee, Kvesic, at the Olympic Center in Sarajevo yesterday.
During the meeting, Kvesic positively evaluated the relations between the two countries and said that he had visited China during the Beijing Summer Olympics in 2008 and was deeply impressed by the excellent organization work of the Chinese side. He believed that China had the ability to hold the Winter Olympics in a special period, and hoped to carry out more extensive exchanges and cooperation with the Chinese side in the field of sports.
Ji Ping said that the two countries have a special "Olympic bond."
The 1984 Sarajevo Winter Olympics was successfully held here in 1984, and two months later, the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics will open, presenting the world with a simple, safe and spectacular event.
Looking forward to deepening exchanges and cooperation between the two countries in the preparation of winter sports events, athlete training and other aspects, the Chinese Embassy in Bosnia and Herzegovina is willing to continue to play the role of a bridge, and promote the deepening of human exchanges between the two countries, so that the people of the two countries can look forward to the future together, and wish the Bosnian athletes to achieve good results in the Beijing Winter Olympics.
Before the meeting, the BH Olympic Committee held the “Best Athlete of the Year” award ceremony, and Ji Ping, as a special guest, presented the award to the best young athlete of BH.
The promotional video of the Beijing Winter Olympics was played in real time at the venue.

48-hour negative nucleic acid test, set up “buffer zone”, the State Council issued a notice to strengthen the epidemic prevention and control of ports and cities - Xinhua News Agency
Xinhua News Agency Beijing, December 11 (Reporter Dong Ruifeng and Gu Tiancheng) The State Council's Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism has recently issued a notice on strengthening the prevention and control of the new coronavirus pneumonia epidemic in port cities, requiring that personnel leaving land border ports (excluding those connected to Hong Kong and Macao) must hold a negative nucleic acid test certificate within 48 hours, and personnel arriving at land border ports must conduct at least one nucleic acid test after arrival.
According to the notice, the time range for the above requirements is from the date of determining the port city range and announcing it to March 15, 2022.
In addition, the notice also proposed that eligible port cities may study setting up a buffer zone for epidemic prevention and control within their jurisdictions.
According to the relevant person in charge of the National Health Commission's Disease Prevention and Control Bureau, for some port cities, cross-border e-commerce is the main economic pillar of the local economy, and the two sides' cross-border trade is frequent.
Implementing differentiated management policies, from one line of defense against the spread of the epidemic to two lines of defense, is expected to move the gate forward, reduce the risk of the spread of the epidemic, and achieve the maximum effect of epidemic prevention and control with the minimum social impact and minimum social cost.
Recently, there have been a number of domestic cluster outbreaks in China, all of which were imported from overseas through port cities.
The notice pointed out that this exposed some problems such as the late warning of epidemic monitoring and early warning, the non-implementation of the closed-loop management of high-risk personnel, the form of regular nucleic acid testing, the failure to kill the cold chain items at each link, the non-standard management of the centralized isolation site, and the lack of scientific and accurate emergency response to the epidemic.
The notice requires efforts to improve the mechanism for epidemic prevention and control in port cities, strengthen the early warning and monitoring system for epidemic prevention and control, and implement border control measures, accelerate the filling of shortfalls and weaknesses in the prevention and control of port cities, and do not relax, scientifically and accurately carry out prevention and control work, and tightly weave the outer defense and entry defense lines.
The notice stressed that each port city should study and deploy the prevention and control of the epidemic and the guarantee of people's livelihood at the same time, publish and open the hotlines for the guarantee of people's livelihood, regularly check the potential hidden dangers of the supply and price of basic necessities, and promptly solve and actively respond to the outstanding problems reported by the public.
According to the notice, the port cities referred to in the notice include the counties (cities, districts, counties) where the open land, water and air ports are located, the counties (cities, districts, counties) where the counties (cities, districts, counties) where the counties (cities, districts, counties) where the counties (cities, districts, counties) where the counties (cities, districts, counties) where the counties (cities, districts, counties) where the counties (cities, districts, counties) where the counties (cities, districts, counties) where the counties (cities, districts, counties) where the counties (cities, districts, counties) where the counties (cities, districts, counties) where the counties (cities, districts, counties) where the counties (cities, districts, counties) where the counties (cities, districts, counties) where the counties (cities, districts, counties) where the counties (cities, districts, counties) where the counties (cities, districts, counties) where the counties (cities, districts, counties) where the counties (cities, districts, counties) where the counties (cities, districts, counties) where the counties (cities, districts, counties) where the counties (cities, districts, counties) where the

Vintage single items are inevitably small defects, so if you decide to buy vintage products, you should have this in mind.

Oil pipeline video exposes U.S. military's 20-year bloodlust - Xinhua News Agency
(Video source: YouTube)
On December 11, a micro-documentary called "Killing Machine" on the oil platform attracted widespread attention.
The film tells the story of the United States launching the war in Afghanistan in the name of anti-terrorism, forcing the output of American democracy through war, 20 years of bloody, bloodthirsty, killing innocent people, committing all kinds of crimes against humanity.
Abusing drones to attack civilian places such as hospitals and schools, distorting humanity, and forming a murder squad.
In the past 20 years, the U.S. military has killed tens of thousands of innocent civilians in Afghanistan.
The U.S. military set up "black jails" to torture and humiliate "criminals."
A series of crimes against humanity has sparked more hatred of Afghans.
As the video says, the U.S. "war on terror" has only made things worse.
War has not brought peace, democracy, prosperity and hope to the Afghan people, but only a country full of ruins and countless killings.
Watch the video and join us in exposing the truth behind America's "anti-terrorism" killings in the name of bloodlust, and the hypocrisy of American democracy!
I happened to see the following article, which talks about why this customer wants the logistics company in the bonded warehouse to do the canning, from a commercial perspective and from the point of view of the shelf life, although the canning is deep processing and not within the scope of the bonded logistics company's business, here is a text that may explain why the customer wants to do this.
I've been to a lot of milk powder factories, and I've seen a lot of milk powder production lines.
In fact, the raw materials of powdered milk in bags are the same as those of powdered milk, and there is no difference.
So, people will ask: Why is the shelf life of a bag one year, while the shelf life of a carton is two years or more?
Or ask: why is the price difference between hearing aids and bags so big?
In fact, from this point of view, many consumers or mothers think that this is because the raw materials are different, and the quality will be much better.
In fact, the raw materials are the same, but everyone thinks that the better ones are more expensive.
There are also consumers who say that after eating this mentality, they say that the taste or taste is different!
Now I will tell you the reason for the disgrace, where is it?
Why is there such a big difference in the price of the same raw materials?
Because most manufacturers consider that if the bag price is too high, consumers will not accept it, which means that the manufacturer's profit is low or even no profit, so what does the manufacturer survive on?
So they have a big uplift in the pricing of the hearing aids to secure their profit margins.
Therefore, most manufacturers promote hearing aids rather than bags.
And how can so many manufacturers spend tens of millions or even hundreds of millions of yuan on advertising every year?
Of course, everyone can imagine.
As the development of society, the promotion cost of the market, such as: the promotion staff of the store, the display cost of the store, the gift cost of the product, the advertising cost, etc. are also increasing.
Therefore, various manufacturers are constantly adding new products, and the prices are also constantly rising. This is a new product that comes with the increase in market costs.
The main purpose is to get higher profits, but the cost of their raw materials will not be more than 3 or 4 yuan.
There are also some brands that, in order to promote their own products, have no choice but to hook up with doctors in hospitals, and help them promote the products, with profits ranging from 30 yuan to 80 yuan.
And the relevant laws in China are absolutely not allowed to do this way of operation. In fact, this way of operation is to harm consumers.
It is recommended that people buy powder in bags under the premise of having a bowl at home, which can save money and increase the preservation and sealing of milk powder, and has no effect on children.
Also, don't think that the shelf life of hearing aids is longer than that of bags. If the shelf life of hearing aids and bags is the same after opening, it is just that the bags are not easy to store after opening, and are prone to deterioration due to moisture.
The delivery was late, the food was cold, and after it was cold, it was dry and hard, and I couldn't eat it at all.
And the soup came out too.
Cancelled immediately, his #PRS_ORG# deliveries must have been cold

Don't scare people at the starting line - Xinhua News Agency
When you go to the book market, you can often feel the fire of successful academic books.
Today's success books often preach the "best principles" - - that is, to assume or imply that you can "do it" - - and then tell you what you need to do "to do it."
That is to say, it is the most important, the most fundamental link to "how to do it."
That's why all these books have one common characteristic — either do it all at once, or don't do anything at all; either it's 100, or it's 0; either you climb Mount Tai, or you just stay where you are.
This "best principle" makes everyone who sees it admit that it is "absolutely correct", but 99% of people will be frightened before the starting line.
Because this theory advocates a path of "you have to make a decision to change your life and make a 180-degree turn," which is precisely the fatal weakness of many people.
For those who are stuck in their ways, who refuse to change, you should shout at them in their ear, "You need to change," which is self-deception and playing the fool.
Most people will be afraid and hesitant in front of the two words of “change”, and they can’t make up their minds; or they will make up their minds to change with a momentary impulse, and bravely take the first step, but often it is not good for a long time, and it is difficult to persevere.
Ma Sanli's famous "From Tomorrow Onwards" is a classic portrayal of this "universal humanity."
The biggest problem with the "best principle" is that the threshold is too high, and it often exceeds the limits of ordinary people's ability, making the vast majority of people "look up in admiration" .
Perhaps, the "good principles" are a way for more ordinary people to walk on the path of relative success.
The core of the "good principle" is to "lower the threshold" - - it encourages a "small victory for big victory" theory, that if you can't do 100, just do 1 - - because 1 is always greater than 0; if you can't climb Mount Tai, just climb the small sand dune in front of your house - - because it's always better than standing still.
In short, as long as you do something, it is always better than not doing anything.
With the lowered threshold, there are more opportunities for ordinary people to persevere, and the probability of success will increase with perseverance.
However, the road to success is a little longer if you follow the principle of "second best".
In essence, "the best principle" is a banner of success for everyone, but in the end, it can only motivate a few; while "the second best principle" can effectively motivate more people and benefit more people as much as possible.

The amount of naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake increased by 0.71 million tons this year - Xinhua News Agency
According to the latest monitoring results, the amount of naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake has increased by 0.71 thousand tons this year, reaching 108.5 thousand tons, which is 40 times more than the protection period in 2002.
The Qinghai Lake naked carp is a precious fish species unique to Qinghai Lake, and plays an important role in maintaining the safety and biodiversity of the “water-fish-bird” ecological chain in the Qinghai Lake basin.
In the 1960s and 1970s, the number of naked carp in Qinghai Lake was greatly reduced due to factors such as the large-scale killing of naked carp and the deterioration of the breeding water environment. In 2002, the amount of naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake was only 2592 tons.
In 2004, Qinghai Lake naked carp was listed as an endangered species in the Red List of Chinese Species.
Since 2003, Qinghai Province has implemented a ban on fishing for naked carp in Qinghai Lake and its main rivers and tributaries, and has prohibited the sale of naked carp and its products.
At the same time, through artificial reproduction and release, and cleaning of the main inflow rivers of Qinghai Lake, and the design of scientific and reasonable “fishway” and other measures, the amount of naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake has been increasing year by year.
Yang Lin, deputy director of the Agriculture and Rural Affairs Department of Qinghai Province, introduced that up to now, Qinghai Lake naked carp has been artificially propagated and released more than 1.8 billion heads, and the contribution rate to the recovery of Qinghai Lake naked carp resources is more than 23 %.
The source area of the Three Rivers in Qinghai is an important ecological barrier and water source conservation area in China and Asia, and Qinghai Lake is a natural barrier and ecological function area that controls the spread of desertification from the west to the east.
In order to protect the ecological environment of the source region of the Three Rivers and Qinghai Lake, protect the aquatic wildlife and maintain the biodiversity of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, since this year, Qinghai has successively issued the ban on fishing in the key waters of the Yangtze River, the Yellow River and Qinghai Lake, and built a “one river, one river, one lake” comprehensive ban on fishing management system.

I just read a fake article that was too long.
For those who don't know, here's a quick primer.
Most girls experience their first period at some point between the ages of 13 and 15, and stop menstruating around the age of 50.
After that, they will come once a month, if they are in good health.
But it is not regular enough to be accurately predicted, and it is about a week's difference, so it needs to be prepared in advance, and sometimes bad luck will turn over (suddenly a few days in advance).
The length of time, the amount of blood, and the severity of the period vary from person to person, some lasting three days, some lasting a week; some with less flow, some with heavy bleeding; some with no reaction, some with pain until the ambulance takes them away, and the pain changes over time.
Periods cannot be controlled, and there is blood for 24 hours from beginning to end. The only thing you can do is to use a sanitary pad or sanitary towel to prevent the blood from flowing to the clothes and the chair.
Menstrual pain is mainly due to the secretion of prostaglandins, and it is effective to relieve the pain of the month in the early stage of menstruation, but it is of no use after the onset of menstrual pain.
Before the menstrual period, due to the excessive release of prostaglandins and the accumulation of blood in the uterus, it is easy to have diarrhea.
If you're around the time of your period, you're going to get your period in two days.
Tampons should be changed every two to three hours, otherwise they will breed bacteria, and the worst case is to change them six times a day, seven days a month, which is 42 pieces, and if you add the pre-prepared amount, there may be 50 pieces, which is not used every month.
(Here, you don't need to change the sanitary napkins often, maybe once every five or six hours, up to eight hours)
The menstrual cycle hormone may be more irritable, and the ovulation period will also be unstable due to the change of hormones in the body, which is very unfortunate, and the body makes its own obstacles.
But the official crime rate data shows that women have a high ability to control their emotions and will not use emotional issues as an excuse.
Menses is not just blood, it includes the shedding of the uterine lining.
The inner membrane of the uterus is the thinnest after the end of menstruation, and it gradually thickens, which can be understood as the uterus is a house, each month it builds a house (the inner membrane thickens) to welcome guests, and the guests do not come, all of them are removed (menstruation) and a new house is built the next month, and the cycle continues.
Menstruation is inconvenient, and has been for decades, with 24 hours of bleeding every month, and abdominal pain and back pain. Who wants to do that?
But a person is born because his mother has her period, the period is to prepare you to live in a house for 10 months when you first come into this world, you should thank your mother for her regular and healthy period.
Women have been suppressed for a long time, and society has brainwashed women that it is dirty, shameful, and everyone thought that was the way it was, but times have changed.
If someone feels nauseated by menstruation, feels that the female body is a preparation for the birth of life, and should not be said in public, the girls stand up, do not think like this again, have never experienced it, and do not know much about men, do not be so ungrateful and ignorant, what kind of attitude is it to face your own mother, what kind of attitude is it to want your own children?
Finally, try the sanitary towels, they are really useful.
Today is the Winter Solstice Festival, and it is disappointing to miss it
And I'm going to order another meal for the kids.
The shops should check the products in the midst of the busy time
Is the foot bath in the bathtub a leak of electricity?
Choosing the right foot bath can play a good role in foot care and health. Today, the editor of Guomei will answer this question for you, hoping to help friends.
As people's health awareness increases, the popularity of foot baths has increased, and a large number of products of different grades have emerged in the market, ranging from hundreds of yuan to thousands of yuan, giving consumers a lot of choice space.
On the surface of the relevant data, the sales of health care appliances such as bathtubs are booming compared with traditional household appliances, but bathtubs do not have a specific industry standard, so there are certain safety risks.
"It's so dangerous to soak your feet in electricity-filled water!"
Mr. Li told reporters that recently, he bought a foot bath as a birthday gift for his father, but his father felt his feet were numb when he took a bath.
Mr. Li first thought it was the vibration function of the foot bath, but he did not expect that after turning off the vibration function, his father still felt numb on the soles of his feet.
Mr. Li tried the electric pen, and the electric pen actually lit up. Mr. Li was surprised to find that the water in the foot bath actually had electricity.
Later, he contacted the merchants, and the attitude of the merchants was good, although he withdrew the foot bath, Mr. Li was still unhappy.
Because he found that there is no clear and detailed industry regulation on the setting of the highest temperature, what kind of people it is suitable for, what kind of materials ensure safety, and so on.
However, in general, the bathtub is unlikely to have problems with electricity, but it is possible that some products are not strictly checked when they leave the factory.
Therefore, when purchasing, choose a split-body bathtub.
Hydroelectric power is isolated and there are no safety concerns.

The 13th Provincial Tea Fair opened - Headlines - Hunan Daily News - Huasheng Online
Hunan Daily, December 10, 2019 (Full media reporter Zhang Shangwu, Hu Panpan, reporter, Liu Xiaoling, photographer, Li Jian) Today, the 13th Hunan Tea Industry Exhibition and New Huzhou Red Tea Promotion Meeting was held at the Hunan International Convention and Exhibition Center. The exhibition of the tea industry, the innovation of tea technology, the promotion of tea culture, and the acceleration of the 100 billion tea industry target were displayed.
Vice Chairman of the China National Cooperative Supply and Marketing Federation, Hou Shunjie, and Vice Chairman of the Provincial People's Congress, Ye Hong, attended the opening ceremony.
Prof. Liu Zhonghua, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, made a solemn introduction at the opening ceremony: The source of Lake Hong, which has risen in New Huzhou, has injected new energy into the “Five Colors of Xiang Tea” with the rise of red tea.
In recent years, the provincial committee and provincial government have vigorously supported the development of the tea industry and promoted the construction of the 100 billion Xiang tea industry, forming the development pattern of “three Xiang and four water and five colors tea”.
The tea industry in the province has increased innovation, and main tea products such as green tea, black tea and red tea have been launched in turn, and the main production areas have promoted the integration of tea tourism and increased the income of tea farmers.
The feng shui wheel turns, and the red tea is back in action.
Experts in the tea industry in the province said that after harvesting green tea, red tea and black tea, tea farmers have income throughout the year, and the value of tea plantations has been rising.
At the opening ceremony, provincial leaders awarded licenses to the fourth batch of enterprises that have been granted the right to use the “Hunan Red Tea” trademark, and New Huzhou was proud of “Huzhou Red Source”.
In the new tea pavilion, a Fujian tea merchant saw a high mountain tea called "Ice Spring" and immediately placed an order.
Secretary Wang Jun of the provincial tea industry association said that the current epidemic and other factors have had some impact on the tea market, but from the tea exhibition, there are many highlights.
The new white tea is red, and it is infused with the connotation of tea culture. It is popular and there is a lot of trading. The Xiang tea industry welcomes a new spring.
So if the food isn't hot, can it be cancelled?

Metaphysics is the study of questions that cannot be answered directly through perception through the use of rational reasoning and logic.
Metaphysics is the basic law of philosophy, which aims to explain the fundamental nature of existence and the world.
The Chinese name "metaphysics" comes from the phrase "metaphysic" in the "Yi Jing" (Book of Changes), which means "the upper is called the way, and the lower is called the instrument." It was translated by Japanese Inoue Tetsujiro (the Meiji era) from the word "metaphysic."
The branches of metaphysics include ontology, natural theology and its extensions.
Ontology is the study of "what are the names that represent the real existence entities, and what are the names that only represent a concept."
Metaphysical naturalism is the denial of the existence of God.
Its theoretical basis is that all phenomena can be explained by concepts of natural reason, proposed by philosophers who support science and evolution.
And the naturalistic method is a method of study that does not involve a word for God.
The philosophy of mind is a branch of philosophy that studies the nature of consciousness and its relationship to the body (especially the brain).
Dualism and monism are the two main schools of thought that discuss the relationship between the mind and the body.
Epistemology is a branch of philosophy concerned with the nature, origin, and scope of knowledge.
Ethics is the systematic study of human moral life; here, ethics is defined as a set of rules accepted by a group of people or a culture.
It is mainly divided into meta-ethics (abstractly studying the theory of ethics or criticizing its essence), normative ethics (evaluating various different moral views and giving moral guidelines for right or wrong behavior).
It studies what ethical behavior standards people should follow, applies ethics (the academic study of applying ethical theories to real-life situations, including bioethics, political ethics, etc.), and describes ethics (the collection of information about how people live, from observed patterns).
It is not based on a preconceived theory, but on the actual moral agent's (moral agent) actual choices and the real choices observed, and all the moral factors of this decision are discussed. It explores the ethical view held by the social group.
The history of ethics includes Greco-Roman ethics and medieval Christian ethics.
Part 1: The ethical thought of humanism, represented by Valla and Monda.
The second part: the ethical ideas of the Reformation, represented by Calvin.
Part III: Political ethics, represented by Machiavelli and others, modern ethics (17th-18th century, British empiricist ethics, representative figures: Hume, etc.; 17th-18th century, European rationalist ethics, representative figures: Spinoza, etc.; 18th century, French Enlightenment ethics, representative figures: Voltaire, etc.; 18-19th century, German academy ethics, representative figures: Kant and Hegel, etc.; 18-19th century, British utilitarianism ethics, representative figures: Bentham, etc.; 19th century, British evolutionary ethics, representative figures: Spencer, Huxley, etc.; late 19th century, German new Kant ethics, representative figures: Kierkegaard, etc.; late 19th century, new Hegelian ethics, representative figures: Thomas H. Green, etc.).
Logic is a discipline that studies "principles and standards of valid reasoning and proof."
Logic usually consists of three parts: inductive reasoning, deductive reasoning, and abductive reasoning, which can be divided into formal logic and non-formal logic.
Aesthetics is a discipline that studies the nature and meaning of beauty.

Ding Zilin: To my friends.
I would like to express my sincere gratitude to all my friends who have provided humanitarian assistance to us for more than 30 years since the death of our loved ones, especially since I issued a humanitarian appeal on behalf of myself in January 1994, which has not been interrupted until now.
Nowadays, most of the deceased's parents have passed away, and the orphans have grown up and found jobs.
It is your efforts that have helped us, the bereaved families, through the most difficult of times.
The coronavirus pandemic is sweeping the world, and most of the donors are already retired.
Therefore, I strongly urge you to stop our mother group in Tiananmen Square from receiving humanitarian donations, which should have ended long ago.
I will always remember your love and I am sure that your deeds will be remembered in history.
Due to various reasons, I can only express my wishes in this way, please forgive me!
Please accept my sincere blessings.
Tao said: "I would like to take this opportunity to introduce the 32-year history of the International Federation of Chinese Students and Scholars (IFCSS) and the Minnesota Chinese Democracy Foundation (MCDF) in humanitarian relief.
While engaged in humanitarian relief, the ACLU of Minnesota and the Minnesota China Democracy Foundation are parallel organizations, and the project's implementers often overlap.
(Apple Daily photo: The Tiananmen Mothers website is managed by a potter.) pic.twitter.com/UxID9ZGjzm
The relief funds often fail to reach the people in need.
In 1994, Ding teacher suggested that a special group be established to coordinate and supervise the receipt and distribution of relief funds.
In 1998, MCDF established the “Orphan Education Fund for the June 4th Victims”, which was implemented for 11 years, and in 2009, after all the June 4th orphans graduated from university, MCDF established the “Special Needs Relief Fund for the June 4th Orphans”, and has been implemented since then.
The funding for these projects comes primarily from campus and community donations in 1989, individual generous donations, and the support of the Brothers University Democracy Foundation.
It has also received support from the Labour Research Foundation since 2018.
It was only last year, after a gap of 31 years, that the six-four survivors finally received a donation from Hong Kong that had been raised in the name of the 1989 pro-democracy protests.
During this time, Chinese Human Rights Watch also carried out its humanitarian relief projects independently.
We understand that Teacher Ding stopped the donation for the sake of the donors, and we are also some retired elderly people, whose income is not as abundant as it was before retirement, so we would like to express our gratitude to Teacher Ding’s “Letter to Friends”.
We will respect the decision of the affected people and terminate the project within two years, and resume it immediately when needed.
I would like to express my gratitude and respect to those who, over the years, have risked their lives to deliver humanitarian aid to those in need.

[Effect] Photo effect: I took two pieces of clothes. In general, it is not bad. I like this set of pictures very much.
[Service] Service details: Because pregnancy is a little uncomfortable when applying makeup, the makeup artist and staff are very considerate, and let me rest on the side for a while, and keep pouring me hot water
The price of the set: 1000 yuan
Thank you for your comment. I originally said that it was not suitable for ancient music. I didn't expect the finished product to be so beautiful.
Thanks to Dan Dan's endorsement, your satisfaction will keep us energized and moving forward, and we will continue to work hard!
This photography studio is really great and I highly recommend it to all my friends!
From reception, makeup, wardrobe, lighting, photography to post-production, everything was flawless.
The makeup artist is very meticulous, and will match your style to create a suitable makeup for you, and the makeup products are all first-line big brands.
Of course, photography is quite professional.
The whole studio has an artistic atmosphere, and there are two little cats to play with.
We were working in Beijing, and the better movie theaters in Beijing needed to be lined up six months in advance, and our colleagues had filmed in Beijing, and after seeing the film, they thought it was just so so.
I was specifically looking for this studio, a place with soul and attitude.
Our facial expressions are not very good, and this is a shortcoming of most people. Photographer Liangge will capture the natural and wonderful moments.
Makeup artists, photographers, post-production designers, a well-rounded team.
The film has received a lot of praise from us and the people around us.
I've already recommended it to my girlfriend, and she's just as happy as I am to see the film.
I hope that this studio won't be buried, and more people will find it and shoot their own style, instead of the same style.
Thank you very much for the five-star review of Zhenting and Jingling, both of whom are very thoughtful and creative new people. We are the creative studio. As long as the customer likes us, we will do our best to complete 100% of the effort. Thank you for meeting and meeting
Sweet and caring assistants, lively and cheerful photography teachers, everyone in the team is super nice, beautiful and wonderful, and it is a very memorable experience, and the effect of the shooting is much better than I imagined. Everyone worked hard, thank you very much 😘😘
Thanks for Xiaoyu's comment. Knowing you is also a coincidence. From Hohhot to Qinhuangdao, your trust is a distance of thousands of kilometers. I am very happy to know you. If there is a chance, I will come to Qinhuangdao next time.

Now the restaurant staff are calling me.
A programming noob who wants to share his personal experience.
If you want to enter this industry, you can choose to find a place to train, but if you don't have this idea, it's better to learn on your own, after all, the training costs a lot of money, and it takes six months to learn.
But if you are planning to get into this industry, training is a very good choice, especially for those who are self-disciplined and weak.
If you are more self-disciplined, you can also choose to learn by yourself, but it will be more tiring.
Of course, choosing a good training institution is very important.
First, we need to look at the strength of the institution's teachers. If the strength of the teachers is not strong enough, then this training institution has no meaning. Of course, some newly opened training institutions do not have very strong teachers.
Secondly, before choosing, it is better to inquire about the training institution, and it is better to inquire about the students who have graduated from the institution. After all, only the students of the institution know what the institution is like, and the courses taught are good or bad.
Hi, I'm sorry, I don't know how to answer your question because I haven't introduced my own situation, and learning this has a lot to do with one's own situation.
For example, your profession, age, the language you want to learn, and even the city you want to live in are all related to the industry you want to work in.
If you are a student and have not graduated or have graduated in computer science, then I personally recommend self-study, which is the most efficient and cost-effective, and now many offline and online training institutions are also very good, but the cost of learning is high, and the time invested is relatively long, which basically needs to be concentrated for 3-6 months.
But if I were to talk about these situations, self-study is very convenient now, and many learning resources on the Internet are free, or there are many training resources on bilibili, and if you don't find resources, you can also contact me through my profile to get free resources or detailed consultation.
There are also some more classic books that can be combined with videos for comprehensive learning.
If you are not a computer professional, but you can afford to pay for some learning costs and time, then it is recommended that you go to a training institution to learn, so that the learning is not very difficult, and the teacher's explanation is very detailed, and there are people who specialize in answering questions, and there is also help in learning planning or supervision.
And now many training institutions will sign employment agreements, have internal recruitment quotas, and recommend to go to the company after learning, so that the interview stage of finding a job can also save a lot of things.
That's just my opinion, and since I don't know your situation, I'm not going to go into detail, but if you have any other questions, feel free to contact me at any time.
I said I was there by 1 p.m. and I saw it on the app

I will give you the opportunity to be satisfied, quality speaks for itself, because professionalism deserves to be trusted, and your recognition is my encouragement!
It's not a good time to be in business!
But I always believe that as long as you are serious, persistent, and hard-working, you will be better than others, at least better than complaining all the time!"
A day begins with the dawn, all the good things start from the morning, wish you carry happiness, luck, health and good fortune, start a new day, keep a good mood all day long Good morning
As a child, happiness was something to be had; as an adult, happiness is a goal to be achieved; and as an adult, happiness is a state of mind to be understood.
Do the most real and kindest self, do it according to one's heart, no regrets in this life; life is a path, go your own way; life has two treasures: good body and good mood, beautiful and bright, live to old age!
Every stage of life will have its own set of challenges.
Often, what holds you back is not your ability, but the courage to face it.
Since there is no way to avoid it, it is better to face it with a smile.
The more afraid you are, the more you will be defeated; if you face difficulties, the problem will eventually be solved.
Curator of Zhongsha held the Saudi Arabia's first biennial exhibition of contemporary art - Xinhua News Agency
Liyadh, Saudi Arabia, December 12 (Reporter Wang Haizhou, Hu Guan) - The first Saudi Arabia Contemporary Art Biennial - Diriya Contemporary Art Biennial was officially opened to the public on the 11th in the Diriya JAX Art District located in the northwest of Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. A total of 64 artists from Saudi Arabia, China and other countries participated in the exhibition.
The biennial exhibition was jointly organized by the Saudi Diyarbayir Biennial Foundation and the China UCCA Yuanren Contemporary Art Center, and the China UCCA Yuanren Contemporary Art Center director Tian Feiyue served as the artistic director.
According to the exhibition team, the theme of the biennial exhibition is "Crossing the River by Touching the Stone", which is a metaphor for the reform strategies taken during the period of social and economic transformation, and also reflects the current situation of Saudi Arabia's social and cultural development.
The biennial exhibition covers an area of nearly 12,000 square meters, and the exhibition hall spans six interconnected buildings, presenting six units: "Crossing the River by Touching Stones", "Inheritance as an Experiment", "Marginal Thinking", "Towards the Public", "Beautiful New World" and "On the Spirit of Art".
Among them, the number of works by 27 Saudi artists accounts for more than 40 percent of the total number of works in the exhibition, including painting, installation art and performance art in various forms; the works of 12 Chinese artists have also attracted attention, some artists use recycled materials in a novel way to create, such as Xu Bing in the series of stories behind the endless mountains of the mountains of the mountains of the mountains of the mountains of the mountains of the mountains of the mountains of the mountains of the mountains of the mountains of the mountains of the mountains of the mountains of the mountains of the mountains of the mountains of the mountains of the mountains of the mountains of the mountains of the mountains of the mountains of the mountains of the mountains of the mountains of the mountains of the mountains of the mountains of the mountains of the mountains of the mountains of the mountains of the mountains of the mountains of the mountains of the mountains of the mountains of the mountains of the mountains of the mountains of the mountains of the mountains of the mountains of the mountains of the mountains of the mountains of the mountains of the mountains of the mountains of the mountains of the mountains of the mountains of the mountains of the mountains of the mountains of the mountains of the mountains of the mountains of
Diyarbakir Biennale Foundation chief executive Barclay said he hoped this year's biennale would create an international dialogue and give global audiences the opportunity to learn about Saudi Arabia's thriving cultural industries and creative communities, and strengthen interactions.
Tian Feiyue said: " The goal of the biennial is to achieve two-fold: to allow Saudi contemporary art to participate in the global dialogue, and to allow Saudi audience to integrate into the world of contemporary art. "
It is understood that a series of lectures will be held during the opening week of the biennial, and artists, curators and leaders of the creative industry will discuss topics such as cross-cultural exchange and the development of contemporary art.

Yunnan: Unifying and standardizing the management of rural public service jobs - Xinhua News Agency
Xinhua News Agency Kunming, December 12 (Reporter Lin Beifang) On December 12, 2020 (reporter Lin Beifang) In recent years, Yunnan Province has issued relevant policies to promote the management of rural public welfare jobs in rural areas to help promote the comprehensive promotion of rural revitalization.
The relevant person in charge of the Yunnan Provincial Department of Labor and Social Affairs introduced that at present, Yunnan has developed a total of 448,300 rural public welfare jobs, which are used to provide employment for rural disadvantaged groups such as poverty-stricken labor force, and play an important role in helping the poverty-stricken masses achieve employment growth, consolidate the achievements of poverty alleviation, and effectively improve the capacity of various public services in rural areas.
The new regulation was jointly issued by seven departments including Yunnan People's and Rural Revitalization, Finance, etc. It mainly unifies the scope of recruitment of rural public service personnel, financial management, job development, job management and other aspects.
In terms of the setting of job development, the new regulations are clear, and it is set up according to the principle of “demand-based, person-based, dynamic management, and total quantity control” “who develops, who uses, who is responsible” and “one person for one post, voluntary disclosure, unified management”.
The recruitment process must follow the steps of announcement, declaration, review, publication, hiring, pre-employment training and placement.
In addition, the new regulations also clearly specified the specific responsibilities of the main development departments of rural public welfare posts, the subsidy standards and subsidy methods of rural public welfare posts, and required the development departments of rural public welfare posts to purchase accident insurance for rural public welfare post placement personnel. The relevant departments are required to regularly supervise the issuance of subsidies for rural public welfare posts.

Hello
Can I cancel the order?
I re-ordered
Has it been cancelled?
Second, although the right has had an era of aspiration in history, it is not long, so it is short because a little sunshine is brilliant, and a little water is sweaty; a little aspiration is to look forward to the future, and a little defeat is to be defeated by Mao Zedong.
But in the process of social progress, the right has played a positive role.
From the end of the Cultural Revolution to the definition of truth standard, the development of economy, the improvement of science and technology, and the promotion of political institutionalization and human rights protection, the positive significance of the right wing should not be denied.
Three, although I do not fully agree with some of Li Weidong's statements, I am very concerned about his statements and very respectful of Li Weidong; because he is serious, he is serious about China, and he takes China's social problems seriously.
But I oppose his anti-communist theory, I think that revolution is unnecessary, and that revolution inevitably leads to social instability, loss of livelihood, and political groups are muddled, and then foreigners take advantage of the situation.
Fourth, those who change or improve China must have patience and a responsible attitude towards the country and the people, and those who try to take advantage of political opportunism are not right-wingers, but idiots.
Let's talk about the left.
On the left, in fact, are a bunch of outcasts of time and politics.
If the right has a positive meaning for society, the Communist Party will listen to some of the right's words and analyze their ideas when needed, but the left has none of this, because what the left wants is the rubbish that the Communist Party has thrown away!
Five, I recently saw some of my friends arguing back and forth with each other, and it was quite lively, and I thought it was unnecessary.
Don't try to reason with a traitor or a left-winger, they're all the same, there's no reason to reason with them.
Don't try to prove that we are right, and don't think that the traitors and leftists will admit it, why should we?
I told my friends, "When the traitor curses you for five cents, when the leftists curse you for your right dog, it just proves that our middle way is right!"
Many people have ideals when they are young, but forget their ideals when they grow old, or pursue their ideals, but become eccentric.
And the ideal gradually fades away, and even the dragon-slaying boy becomes a dragon.
I think left and right generally refer to constraint and freedom, and China is left-leaning as a result of its innate genes from its history and culture.
Domestic rightists focus on efficiency and development, while leftists strengthen supervision and focus more on fairness and safety.
Now, the society as a whole hopes to pay more attention to fairness, while the conflict between China and the United States is inevitable, and the left is positive. It is estimated that it will continue for many years.
Although I can't understand it, I'll just praise it.
That's what flowers are for, to stand up for what's right.
In recent years, the United States has blocked and encircles Huawei chips, which has not only put Huawei in an unprecedented predicament, but has also caused huge losses to American enterprises.
The United States has suppressed China's chip industry, requiring its own enterprises and allies to lock down related enterprises in China's chip industry at the same time, which directly led to the impact on the orders and profits of global chip suppliers, resulting in the reduction of R&D investment and production capacity of chip production enterprises, which in turn caused the shortage of chip supply chains in the global supply chain.
Today, “chip shortage” has spread to all major industries around the world, such as car companies shutting down production, mobile phones rising in price, and almost all industries that use chips have been affected.
In order to master the autonomy of “chips”, more and more technology giants in more and more countries have begun to go the road of “de-Americanization”.
In order to firmly control the global semiconductor control and restrain the development of the Chinese semiconductor industry, the United States has acted frequently recently, and has hosted the "Chip Summit" and invited 64 major countries to establish a semiconductor alliance and raise funds to support the U.S. domestic technology giants, such as Intel, the U.S. traditional technology giant. Intel spent $20 billion to build two semiconductor plants in Arizona, USA, and opened up the chip subcontracting business to the world.
When most people thought that Intel's move would have a certain impact on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC), and it was possible to steal TSMC's "rice bowl."
This is because Intel, as a veteran tech giant in the United States, has been engaged in the semiconductor field for decades, and has a large number of talent teams and technical reserves. It must be able to rise quickly and defeat TSMC in the short term.
However, Zhang Zhongmou, founder of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC), did not take Intel's decision lightly.
At the “2021 Master Think Tank Forum” held in April this year, Zhang Zhongmou’s words were shocking. For Intel’s investment in the construction of a wafer factory, Zhang Zhongmou said bluntly: Intel builds a chip foundry, which is quite ironic.
Zhang Zhongmou's dislike of Intel's entry into the wafer field is because Zhang Zhongmou still has a grudge against TSMC and Intel more than 30 years ago.
In the 1960s and 1970s, Intel was the pearl of the American manufacturing industry, occupying the top position in the world, and was the hegemon of the world's semiconductor industry.
By the 1980s, the world's top-end chips had been monopolized by a few powerful people.
At that time, the semiconductor industry was characterized by the IDM model, in which chips were designed, manufactured, and tested by a single factory. Intel was the representative of that era.
However, this model has left many small businesses struggling, and many semiconductor entrepreneurs faced with the huge cost of building a production line.
After entering the 1980s, the chip industry began to see the phenomenon of division of labor, and in 1984, Zhang Zhongmou heard that there was a company specializing in chip design, and he thought that since there was a company specializing in design, then a factory specializing in the manufacture of wafers could be established.
Soon after, Zhang Zhongmou's vision became a reality, and TSMC was born.
TSMC has focused on the single link of “wafer processing”, and does not design, but only provides contract services for wafer manufacturing.
At that time, the newly established Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) was just a small fry in front of the giant Intel.
In order to get capital support, Zhang Zhongmou once sought investment from Intel, but when Intel heard that TSMC only did the manufacturing process of the chip industry, it was obviously very proud, and refused to invest in TSMC.
Zhang Zhongmou also recognized that Intel was contemptuous of the semiconductor process service at that time.
I didn't expect that the giant of wafer manufacturing services that I looked down on in the past would also have to start wafer subcontracting now.
So, Zhang Zhongmou felt that Intel's entry into wafer fabrication was ironic.
TSMC's market value has now surpassed Intel's.
In the face of TSMC's strong offensive, Intel is also unwilling to be complacent.
Today, TSMC is rushing towards 3nm chips, while Intel is still stuck at 14nm from 7 years ago.
It's not easy to catch up.
It's not over yet
By 19:06, it was two hours since I placed the order 😅
Today, we'll look at some of the "strange hot searches."
What is normal sentiment?
Randomly select three hot searches: February 2nd Dragon Rising, the price of Good Luck Friend rose, and the event of Hualala, and the public opinion spread to form a peak, and then the index decreased (smooth curve) and finally dissipated. If there is a secondary public opinion, there will be a small peak again.
They look exactly like the "Internet Public Opinion Evolution Model" that the Cyberspace Administration of China once displayed on its official website.
What is abnormal public opinion?
Six hot searches from the same event were randomly selected to show the shape of a "mountain peak", a "sawtooth" and a "cliff".
The "monocline" refers to the artificial heating and rapid rise to the hot search, attracting the attention of the public; the "sawtooth" refers to the periodic heating to ensure that the topic remains in the hot search list; the "cliff" refers to the collective withdrawal, the hot search has played its "function", and received new tasks and rushed to the new battlefield.
As shown in Figure 9, the heat wave peak of one event exactly coincided with the trough of another event, and the time difference was not more than a second. It must be that the unified naval battalion received the task of launching a new offensive.
The specialization of black public relations is visible: dozens of hot searches are listed at the same time, and which ones attract attention, which ones are responsible for science, which ones generate momentum, which ones divert attention, which ones affect cognition, which ones mislead judgment, which ones incite emotion, and which ones bind decision-making. The black-owned accounts are operated in batches and nodes, taking into account all the elements of the spread of public opinion.
The dissemination of information is a science, and without the subjective factors of position, emotion, and data alone, black public relations will not be able to escape.
Anyone who has passed by will leave traces. Such traces, we will dig them out together.
Data source: hot search time machine.
First cases of Omicron variant infection found in countries including Mauritius - Xinhua News Agency
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 12 (Xinhua) - The first cases of infection with the new coronavirus mutant virus Omicron were reported in Mauritius, Cyprus and Malawi recently.
Mauritius reported its first two cases of Omikron virus infection on the 10th.
According to the Minister of Health Kailesh Jagutpal, one of the infected was a tourist who arrived in Mauritius from South Africa on November 27; the other was a local resident of Mauritius who had been in contact with a person who had recently returned from South Africa and tested positive for nucleic acid on November 30.
After being isolated in the hospital, the two patients tested negative for nucleic acid tests, and have returned to their respective places of residence.
Cyprus's Ministry of Health announced on the 10th that it had confirmed the country's first three cases of infection with the Omicron strain.
The three are students who returned from a trip abroad earlier this month and were not admitted to hospital due to minor illnesses.
In order to prevent the spread of the omicron strain, the government has continued to increase its prevention and control efforts.
From December 6 to January 10, 12-year-old and above passengers entering by plane must pay for nucleic acid testing at the airport upon arrival.
The Ministry of Health also announced on the 10th that it would start vaccinating children aged 5 to 11 in the country with the Pfizer vaccine.
Malawi's Minister of Health, Khumbize Chiponda, said on the 9th that the country had found three cases of Omicron virus infection for the first time.
The country's health department sequenced the genomes of 12 coronavirus positive samples collected from November 9 to December 2, and found the three cases of infection.

American 360 integrated home furnishing
Address: 156, South Ring Road, 12th floor, Happiness Home
At first, it was a friend who introduced me because of trust, so I decided to take a look at it. My initial budget was 70,000 for a basic renovation.
As soon as they entered the store, they began a series of scams.
I went to the store for the first time just to show them my floor plan, they didn't go to the site to measure the house, they were able to give me a quote saying that my 135-square-meter house could be built for 70,000, and they didn't know what brand of materials they were using.
Their second trick is to drag you into the store and hand you over the deposit (and once you've handed over the money, you'll never get it back, unless you've got enough experience to fight them in court).
When I was hesitating whether to pay the deposit, they would invite their so-called manager to tell me that if I paid the deposit today, I could get a discount of how much.
This is a big pit, and I am a living example of being cheated. When I was impulsive, I deposited 10,000 yuan.
He gave me a quote for $70,000, not including the water and electric upgrades, not including any doors or cabinets, and those three are the biggest cost head.
In addition to this, their service charges are higher than those of other companies.
I lost trust in the company, and they signed a contract with me without explaining anything to me in the first place.
When I went to get my money back they were very professional and had a dedicated small team to deal with you.
In any case, it's the customer's problem, and they're totally at fault.
There are many excuses, and there are many details. I don't want to say them one by one. They are all tears. In short, don't choose them, because my friend's house that they renovated is of poor quality, and they will charge you for all the expenses in the end.
It's a shame that they are the original deceitful head decoration, and now they have been changed into a big beauty, as if they have collapsed again and have been changed into something else.
So, don't choose such a crappy decorating company.
In the future, when you choose, you can search for these and consult them because renovation is not a small amount of money.
To ask a question to a merchant, please log in or register first
Prohibited the publication of various forms of business reviews, please see the merchant inclusion statement for details

Is there no other way, like moving to a different address?
Well, then you don't cancel this conversation, and if I don't get my money back in five to ten days, I'm going to pursue it.
I asked if it could be cancelled in less than 15 minutes.

The starry sky has about 丨The Gemini meteor shower will reach its peak on the 14th - Xinhua News Agency
Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, December 12 (Reporter Zhou Runjian) As the last large-scale meteor shower of the year, one of the three major meteor showers in the Northern Hemisphere, the Gemini meteor shower will reach its peak on December 14, and friends who like meteor showers can observe it after midnight on the same day.
Beijing amateur astronomer Anju photographed the Gemini meteor shower in Qinghai on December 13, 2018.
Most of the parent bodies of the meteor showers are periodic comets, but the parent body of the Gemini meteor shower is 3200 Phaethon, an Apollo-type asteroid.
The Gemini meteor shower is also the second known meteor shower that is not caused by a comet.
Li Sipeng, a member of the Tianjin Astronomical Society and an expert in astronomy, said that like the New Year’s blockbuster, the Gemini meteor shower usually appears at the end of the year, and the “screening period” can last from December 4 to 17.
This meteor shower is known for its large and stable flow, and together with the Orion meteor shower and the Perseus meteor shower, it is known as one of the three major meteor showers in the Northern Hemisphere.
One of the distinctive features of the Gemini meteor shower is that the meteor bodies move slowly, the colors are rich, and the fire meteor is not rare. It is suitable for both naked-eye observation and astronomical photography for beginners.
Yang Jing, a stargazer in Tianjin, took pictures of the Gemini meteor shower on December 13, 2020.
The meteor shower in Gemini will peak at about 15:00 on December 14, with a ZHR (the number of meteors that can be seen per hour when the radiant point is directly above the observer's head under ideal observation conditions) of 150.
The Gemini meteor shower chart.
"Last year, the Gemini meteor shower left a deep impression on people, but this year's Gemini meteor shower will be affected by the moon, and the quality will be slightly reduced.
The 14th is the 11th of the lunar calendar, the moon is full, and the bright moonlight will interfere with the observation. Fortunately, the moon will fall at night, and the radiation point of the Gemini meteor shower will rise relatively high.
Friends who like the meteor shower can observe in the late hours of the night after the moon has set, but they should pay attention to keep warm and keep warm. ”
How can we observe more meteors?
"It is not recommended to observe in the city, and one can choose a high altitude, low light, and open view in the northeast direction in the countryside or the suburbs, and then patiently wait for the moon to fall to observe visually.
It should be noted that the flow of the Gemini meteor shower is very large in all directions, and it is not necessary to keep looking at the radiation point of the Gemini meteor shower.
If you like photography, it is best to choose a wide-angle lens with a large aperture, and use high ISO and maximum aperture when shooting.
Stability and sustainability considerations dictate that tripods, spare batteries and shutter cables are also essential. "
"I've never seen a picture of a woman wearing a hijab before, and I don't know what to make of it," he said.
What is the difference between laser TV and traditional TV in market positioning?
In my understanding, the traditional TV that the author referred to should be the liquid crystal TV, and the differences in market positioning between the laser TV and the liquid crystal TV are mainly as follows:
First, laser TVs are more focused on the large screen market.
Compared with the market positioning of full-scale LCD TVs, laser TVs are obviously more focused on the large screen market, or that laser TVs themselves are the products born for large screens.
Currently, the mainstream LCD TV size is in the range of 55 inches to 65 inches, and the size of the laser TV is generally more than 75 inches, and the largest is more than 100 inches, which fully meets the needs of users for large-screen color TVs.
In recent years, the proportion of laser TVs in global shipments and sales has continued to increase, and the proportion has exceeded 60% in the overall TV sales of 80 inches and above.
According to Zhongyi Kang's prediction, the sales volume of laser TV in 2020 will grow more than 140%, and continue to maintain a high growth rate.
The reason why it has achieved such good results in the big screen market is mainly due to the excellent performance of laser TVs in eye protection.
Based on the imaging principle of laser TV reflection, the light emitted by the laser light source does not directly enter the eyeball, and the imaging process is closer to the imaging process of natural conditions, and the stimulation to the eye is smaller.
The Saisi Laboratory of the China Electronics Standardization Institute and the ophthalmologists of Beijing Chao-Yang Hospital, through strict comparison tests of watching laser TV and liquid crystal TV under the same conditions, obtained 144 sets of test data.
The data confirms that the laser TV does have strong eye protection characteristics, and even has certain improvement effects in certain aspects.
At a time when visual health is becoming more and more important, the laser TV has not only attracted more and more users with its eye protection advantages, but also opened another breakthrough in the color TV market.
Second, laser TVs are more focused on the high-end market.
In contrast to the continuous decline in the price of LCD TVs, the current market price of laser TVs is mostly above 10,000 yuan, and the price gradually rises with the upgrade of size and light source.
Why are laser TVs so expensive?
It's a reasonable thing to do.
With the continuous development of light sources and technology, laser TV has many advantages that LCD TV and projection cannot achieve.
With the ultra-short focal length projection technology, the projection distance of the laser TV is shorter than that of the traditional projection device, and it can achieve the experience of a 100-inch large screen within a short distance, and the required space is small, and the host is small and occupies little space.
In terms of brightness, the major brand laser TV can reach more than 2000 lumens.
In addition, the heat generated is lower, the equipment is less damaged, and the life of the TV is longer.
In addition, many high-end laser TV models are equipped with many cutting-edge technologies such as true 4K ultra-high-definition picture quality, artificial intelligence systems, and bionic screens, which can provide users with a more immersive visual and auditory experience.
There is no fake demand, but the product is the result of demand segmentation. In terms of picture quality and input-output ratio, the laser TV is not a dish for video players. If you want to balance the big screen and the viewing environment, you can try it. Everything has advantages and disadvantages, and you can judge yourself after weighing the pros and cons. I am afraid to believe one-sided words.
Simply put, ultra-wide-angle close-focus projectors - laser TVs, in order to get close to the screen, have to use expensive ultra-wide-angle lenses and reflectors, which is not in line with the best optical design.
To shield some of the ambient light, the use of micro-structured Fresnel curtains is expensive, and the price of 80 inches is basically the same as that of a 65-inch LCD.
In addition, I particularly dislike the fact that the projector manufacturers are selling the fact that the reflection is good for the eyes, please, the light on the screen that the eyes can see is direct light, you reflect on the ceiling, and the eyes can not see it, and the true liquid crystal TV is also a reflection, and the ceiling of the TV is also illuminated?
And the projection screen would not be a picture if it wasn't for the reflection.
The heat spots (spots) of the high gain curtains were ignored, and a large amount of light was reflected to the eyes at a certain angle, which was really uncomfortable.
There are currently no shops at the Museum of Visual and Aesthetic Photography.
After adding the WeChat appointment date, the little sister arranged the time for me to choose, and the reply was very timely~
Before going, I had a look at the photos in the store, which were mostly outdoor wedding photos, and they were very beautiful. There were a lot of different styles of photography involved.
After the day was over, I simply exchanged ideas with the little sister, and she patiently helped me try on two styles of clothes that I was indecisive about, and finally decided to start makeup and styling. The photographer would set up some props before shooting, guide the movements, and be more meticulous about the details.
But maybe because I didn't share my specific shooting ideas with them, it wasn't the style I was looking for, but it should have been okay.
After the shoot, the photographer will help to choose the photos, exchange the post-production style, and feel that it is very careful.
It takes about half a month to repair the film, and wait for the effect~
The second time in a row that I won the photo-themed banquet activity - most of the clothes can be selected for photography.
Finally, she chose a black gauze skirt to experience different styles.
The entire shooting process took about 2 hours, and the makeup and shooting were responsible for the photographer who was born in 1995. I feel a little shy, and I hope to give more suggestions on the customer's shooting action guidance in the future. It's quite talkative, and the shooting process is quite enjoyable.

And see Queenie too!
When I went to the store, I first filled in my name and phone number and then selected the clothes. It was quite patient to change clothes three or four times. After selecting the clothes, I put on makeup for a long time. The service attitude was good. Later, they taught me how to pose. It felt like the face was big, and it took half a month to refine it. Three or four days later, it was sent out. It felt like there was no difference from the original film.
【Environment】Overall, the environment is good.
There are many options for clothing.
There are three makeup rooms, one of which is a photo studio.
【Service】Very friendly and attentive.
The stylists were very patient.
The photographer will also teach you the moves very carefully.
If you are not satisfied, the photographer will also take the initiative to make up for it.
【Experience】Maybe the shape is a bit old-fashioned, and the original double eyelids were pasted with three double eyelids.
The eyebrows have also been shaved, which is a little embarrassing for those who don't wear make-up on a daily basis.
The photos have been taken for more than ten days, but the P-graph effect is not very satisfactory. I feel that the eyelids are still very obvious.
Because I didn't know what style I wanted, I tried on two sets of clothes. The result was that I picked out the one I liked. The little girl said that this set of clothes is quite retro and vintage.
After choosing the clothes, I started to do makeup and hair. The hairdresser and the makeup artist were very patient with me, and the effect was very satisfactory.
After I did my makeup, I started taking pictures. The photographer was directing me the whole time, and the process was very smooth and harmonious.
After the shoot, I carefully selected four of my favorite shots and polished them. My brother said that he finished the film in 15 minutes, and the ending was very satisfactory.
No response for 3 days... since your system can't recognize my credit card, I can't join the #PRS_ORG# plus monthly plan!
The strangest thing is that I use the same credit card every time I pay.
I now have to pay for shipping every time
Can I be excused until you have finished your investigation and then collect my monthly fee?
Is it worth buying an umbrella insurance?
The umbrella is an online insurance broker platform.
From the perspective of setting conditions, according to the “Regulations on the Supervision of Insurance Brokerage Institutions (Revised in 2015)”, to become an insurance broker, you must meet three keywords: the shareholder, the founder has no major violations in the past three years, the minimum amount is RMB 500 million, and it must be approved by the China Insurance Regulatory Commission.
These three are actually very strict, in summary, to have strength, to be approved by the national authority of the Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (which regulates insurance companies and banks throughout the country), shareholders must have good conduct, as a small umbrella insurance company, the policyholder does not need to worry too much about whether the small umbrella insurance is legitimate or not, after all, there are these three thresholds, not every insurance company can reach.
At this point, it's good, and trustworthy.
From the perspective of insurance products: small umbrella insurance is an insurance supermarket, many companies' star critical illness insurance are sold on this platform, such as the latest and Thai Super Mary 5 critical illness insurance, the claimant and the underwriter are both Thai Life, and small umbrella insurance is just a third-party intermediary, which does not need to question its credibility.
From the payment mode: Internet platform products, because of the lack of operating costs of business points and the cost of business employees, so the Internet product is generally more cost-effective, and the payment method is flexible, supporting monthly payment, which relieves the pressure of the insured to pay, and at the same time can maximize the leverage of insurance.
That's a very good thing.
It's worth considering.
From the perspective of professionalism: This is very important, because insurance is a very professional industry, and many Internet product customers can self-insure, which will lead to many misunderstandings. In the health disclosure and occupational areas, non-insurance professionals often add their own subjective awareness when they insure, and feel that they are healthy or eligible, which may lead to many claims and risks.
I myself have done insurance phone sales at Tencent Micro Insurance (which is also an online insurance brokerage platform) and I am very responsible in telling people.
The insurance on the Internet is real and reliable, and the unreliable people are people. There are no professional staff in the Internet channel, and there are a lot of misleading sales.
For example: 1 yuan insurance covers 600 million, and the insurance company will give you a mobile phone for free, and you can receive 600,000 for free. These marketing strategies are not wrong, but they are light, and they will not tell the insured person that the first month is 1 yuan, and the second month is required to pay the normal fee, which varies from dozens to 200, and many customers do not know what they are buying.
Thinking it would cost $1, the insurance company paid $600,000 (天下掉馅饼).
Free mobile phones are only given to special policy numbers such as 6666 and 8888, and if a winning SMS is sent, it is not exchanged and no one reminds you.
(This is another pit for the insured) Free 600,000 for serious illness insurance is short-term, if only relying on this, there is no other commercial insurance, in case of serious illness, what to do with 600,000, can't solve the problem, and life begins to run naked.
The government is also cracking down on the misleading sales of internet insurance.
So, in general, there is no problem with the platform, there is no problem with the product, but there is a problem with the professionalism and professional ethics of the salesperson.
The main suggested that the main should comprehensively consider, in fact, many offline insurance brokers' products are more comprehensive, customers can choose more opportunities and products, and the cost performance of some products is better than the Internet products.
I have helped 59 internet customers to insure offline products, and saved them 2000-3000 yuan/year.
If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.
I am a Mia insurance agent, with 3 years of experience in enterprise management training, and I have served more than 1,000 enterprise users, and cooperated with more than 100 insurance companies. Before the insurance, I will start from the customer's needs, customize insurance products for customers, compare three insurance companies for customers, and try to get the best insurance results for customers. After the insurance, I will help customers to organize the insurance policy, custody the insurance policy, so that customers can rest assured.
To grow with each customer for life.
I hope my answer will help the questioner!
According to the definition of the insurance regulatory department, Internet insurance is insurance business that can complete all the insurance procedures autonomously after clicking on the insurance link.
During this process, the policyholder does not need to sign, and the insurance advisor does not need to sign. All steps can be completed by the policyholder himself.
While the insurance coverage of the Internet is not very "ceremonial", it may even lack the printed paper contract, but this does not affect the validity and legal effect of the electronic version of the contract.
This model is somewhat similar to the "telemarketing" style of sales, but there is a fatal problem with buying insurance in this way, which is that the follow-up service may not be able to keep up.
Insurance is usually a long-term contract that lasts for decades, and when we buy insurance, should we think carefully about whether the "insurance intermediary" we choose is someone who can accompany us for a long time and provide us with services in the future?
So how can I contact the delivery staff?
It's already 3 o'clock
Is that compensation for me?
I said I wanted to knock on doors and deliver.
But the rider left it on the doorstep and the man left
And they sent the wrong one.
Your riders have already taken my #NUMBER# of takeaways, but they're still telling me to wait.
The rider received my takeout at 19:25, but still refused to leave
I'm going to go and buy some more food, is there anything else I should get?
What can I do?
Where did your riders go?
And wait?
I'm going to deliver the bill.
Well, if you don't cancel, I'll call the police.
But my food has health and safety issues

I have always been against any form of slander and abuse, and I cannot accept this kind of personal attack.
In a civilized society, we can accept anything, but we must eliminate this scoundrel.
If you don't look at the parties and factions, the first thing to resist is this lack of civility.
From the moment you started sending me Facebook friend requests, to the moment you started posting sarcastic posts, to the moment you tried to post my home address and my father's name on social media, I have taken a no-response attitude.
You have continued to tag me for six meals a day, and your so-called friends have continued to brazenly discuss some hidden and humiliating remarks about me, my appearance, body, well-being, and what kind of bed to plant strawberries on, or not to plant, etc. I... also counted.
Later, I also received messages from several of my friends about your Facebook friend account uploading a picture of you with sexual harassment content.
I'm sorry, as a woman, I can no longer remain silent.
After I reported the news, you didn't calm down at all, but became more and more arrogant.
I don't care what your political background is, or what your social status is, in our society, we need to respect both genders.
Yes, you can continue to make these mocking, cryptic, humiliating, insulting, abusive remarks, you can continue to say that you just care and care about me, you can continue to think that this is not harassment, you can even continue to deny that you did not make the picture or continue to make all the offensive remarks.
Yes, I can't and I don't have the power to stop you.
I don't know you, I don't want to know you, and my looks and my body don't need you to judge me.
I don't think there's any girl who would willingly be humiliated like that in order to get famous.
My friend asked me if I was okay.
I said I wouldn't believe you.
I don't think any one of those girls could say they were okay after being bullied like that.
Only those who lack even the most basic of virtues, whether in work, society, politics or business, will choose to hurt any one woman in this way.
I believe that justice is in the hearts of all people.
I've edited out some of the comments for you to review
Your own posts shouldn't be able to be impersonated by anyone
I can only say that you are the enemy of civilization
A smile in the heart
Vietnam People's Daily - Prime Minister of Vietnam attended the 3rd Vietnam National Digital Technology Enterprise Development Forum
During the third Vietnam National Digital Technology Enterprise Development Forum, two major conferences were held, discussing topics around digital technology enterprises and national digital transformation, digital technology enterprises and the economic recovery and development after the COVID-19 epidemic.
The Minister of Information and Communications, Mr. Nguyen Manh Hung, said that in 2021, despite the continued spread of the COVID-19 epidemic, the number of digital technology enterprises in Vietnam and their operating income still maintained a growth rate of nearly 10%.
In 2021, Vietnam's typical digital products have been cultivated and concentrated to solve Vietnam's major problems. Many digital products have gone out of the country, and Vietnam's digital technology ranking has improved.
Minister Ruan Mengxiong called on digital technology enterprises to take the responsibility of developing national digital transformation platforms, and the task of developing these national digital platforms is to fulfill the mission of the country.
At the forum, leaders from various departments and state agencies, enterprises, organizations and individuals who are researching, developing, applying and transferring digital technologies shared their ideas and solutions to mobilize and collect resources from the whole society to develop Vietnamese technology enterprises, and work together to promote the country's digital transformation and economic recovery after the epidemic.
Prime Minister Fan Minzheng emphasized in his speech at the forum that digital transformation is a must for the world and an objective demand for development.
Digital transformation has become a global issue, and digital transformation services are universal. Therefore, it is necessary to mobilize the participation of the people.
People and enterprises are the core, subject, target and driving force of digital transformation.
Therefore, all policies should be for the people and enterprises.
Premier Fan Minzheng emphasized that the digital transformation should reflect the national spirit, and should be based on internal strength, strategic, long-term and decisive factors, while external factors are important and breakthroughs.
He also believes that digital transformation needs to drive deeper development and sustainable development, participate in the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic, economic recovery and development, respond to the changes after the epidemic, overcome the phenomenon of resource depletion, and promote the green transformation and development of green energy.
The digital transformation requires the establishment of databases for the protection and promotion of national cultural values, historical traditions, national landscapes and folk customs, and the promotion of digital transformation in banking, taxation, land management and development, logistics and other fields.
The ultimate goal of digital transformation is to make people happier and the country more prosperous and developed.
Prime Minister Fan Minzheng called on all levels of government, all levels of agencies and enterprises to increase their leadership and guidance in the development of digital technology, raise their awareness of digital transformation, continue to formulate and perfect the system of digital transformation, and strengthen national management and promote the development of digital technology enterprises in a spirit of respect, communication, listening, positive and active.
During the forum, Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh attended the award ceremony for the 2021 “Made in Vietnam” excellent digital product and the opening ceremony of the “Made in Vietnam” digital product.

There are a total of 11 floors in the house, from -2 to 9 and -1 and -2 are all parking places, and parking is free during the day!
The surroundings are not good, there are few hardware stores in the hotel, and the taste of the hotel is average.
This elevator is also very useless, just like the big disease, negative two to negative one, back and forth, keep pressing this floor, from the security corridor down to the first floor, is also very useless, directly to a furniture store, the furniture store is closed, the security corridor is not out!

The Yangtze River mainstream has achieved full coverage of the water-green comprehensive service area - Xinhua News Agency
Xinhua News Agency Wuhan, December 11 (Reporter Wang Xian) On the 10th, the Chongqing Fuling Water Green Comprehensive Service Area was completed and put into operation, which is the second water green comprehensive service area in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River after the listing of the Chongqing Fuling Water Green Comprehensive Service Area on the 8th.
Up to this point, the water-green comprehensive service area has covered the upper, middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River.
Mr. Qiu Jianhua, deputy director of the Yangtze River Navigation Management Bureau of the Ministry of Transport, introduced that previously, 10 water-green integrated service areas had been built and operated in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River in Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui and Jiangsu provinces, which were recognized by the majority of ship crews and played an important role in promoting the high-quality development of Yangtze River shipping.
The full coverage of the Yangtze River green comprehensive service area is another milestone event in the construction of the Yangtze River green shipping, and the receiving and shipping service capacity of the Yangtze River ships has been significantly improved.
It is reported that the water-based green comprehensive service area is an important facility to provide a full range of production and living services for a large number of ships and crews, and help a large number of crews solve the problems of “urgent, difficult and hope”.
The construction and operation of two water-based green comprehensive service areas in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, integrating life services, production services and government services, with green and environmental protection as the theme, with ship repair and ship emergency rescue services as the characteristics, will make the work of the crew in the port more efficient and life more convenient.
US carrier group gathers in China's vicinity, the most powerful weapon is rare to visit Guam in 2022-01-17 Multi-media reported that the US carrier group gathered in the vicinity of China, and the most powerful weapon was rare to visit Guam in 2022. The US media also revealed that one of the most powerful weapons in the US Navy's arsenal made a rare visit to Guam, releasing an important signal to the allies and enemies of the United States in the Indo-Pacific region.
According to the South China Sea Strategic Situation Awareness Platform of the Chinese think tank, on January 9, a satellite found the US aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson in the vicinity of Babak Strait.
The Malacca Strait connects the South China Sea and the Sulu Sea, and is a strategic point on the first island chain in the western Pacific Ocean.
The platform is expected to deploy to the South China Sea.
This is the first deployment of the USS Carl Vinson aircraft carrier with F-35C fighters and CMV-22 "Seahawk" carrier-based transport aircraft.
In addition to the USS Carl Vinson, there is also the USS Abraham Lincoln, which departed from the United States on January 3.
The USS Lincoln also carried the first F-35C carrier squadron, the 314th Fighter Attack Squadron of the United States Marine Corps.
In addition to the two aircraft carriers mentioned above, the U.S. Navy currently deploys the “Ronald Reagan” (USS Ronald Reagan) in the Asia-Pacific region, which is docked in Yokosuka, Japan.
The carrier battle group also includes the guided missile cruiser HMS Southampton, the guided missile destroyer HMS Daring, and other vessels.
On January 17, the "South China Sea Strategic Situation Awareness Platform" released the latest satellite images, showing that three U.S. aircraft carriers were gathering in the vicinity of China.
(weibo @Nanhai Strategic Situation Perception) On January 17, 2022, the flight route of the U.S. CMV-22B transport aircraft.
(Weibo @Nanhai Strategic Situation Perception) According to CNN on January 17, one of the most powerful weapons in the US Navy's arsenal made a rare visit to Guam over the weekend.
The Ohio-class nuclear submarine USS Nevada, carrying 20 Trident ballistic missiles and dozens of nuclear warheads, entered the U.S. naval base in Guam on Saturday (Jan. 15).
The US carrier group's visit to China's periphery is a rare opportunity to send a signal to allies and enemies in the increasingly tense situation in the Indo-Pacific region, analysts said.
This is the first visit to Guam by a U.S. ballistic missile submarine since 2016 and the second public visit to Guam since the 1980s.
The three U.S. aircraft carriers have gathered in the vicinity of China, and the most powerful weapons are rare to visit the island of Guam. China has built a large number of military facilities in the Nansha Islands in recent years.
The picture shows Yongshui Island in the South China Sea.
(South China Sea Research Forum) The U.S. Navy said in a statement that the visit of the Ohio-class nuclear submarine Nevada to Guam strengthened cooperation between the United States and its allies in the region, demonstrated the United States' capabilities, flexibility, readiness, and commitment to the security and stability of the Indo-Pacific region.
Ballistic missile submarines are usually called "Boomer submarines".
The whereabouts of the 14 U.S. Navy "Sea Dragon" submarines are usually kept secret.
The secret surrounding the submarine-launched ballistic missile has made the "Thunderbolt submarine" the most important survival weapon in the "nuclear triad" system, which also includes the submarine-launched ballistic missile located in the mainland of the United States, as well as the B-2 and B-52 bombers that can carry nuclear bombs.
Talking to a friend about the recent 26% drop in Meta, market capitalization evaporating $251 billion, Zuckerberg responded, "facing unprecedented competition," and why?
Meta (formerly Facebook) is essentially an advertising company, and its revenue comes mainly from advertising. Today's profitable advertising companies have their own traffic channels.
Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and other functions are all traffic channels of Meta.
Not only that, Meta is the largest “advertising alliance”, and many apps use Meta’s ads through Meta’s advertising platform to achieve monetization.
But times have changed.
First, because of Apple's privacy policy changes, Meta can no longer get user data information, which affects the efficiency of advertising placement.
Apple's current privacy policy is very user-friendly, and it will clearly prompt users whether to allow apps to access their information. Most people's normal reaction is to say no.
If Google does it again, the impact on Meta's revenue will be even greater.
Second, the Chinese factor in Meta's revenue growth has also weakened (the proportion of this factor is uncertain, but it does exist).
Everyone knows that Meta has no business in China, but this understanding is inaccurate.
At least 10% of Meta's revenue comes from China every year, mainly from companies that do maritime business in China.
Meta has about 500 people in its Hong Kong office, and several large agents on the mainland.
Chinese companies want to expand their overseas markets, and Meta is an inescapable advertising channel. Most of the money they burn is given to Meta.
Interestingly, Byte's TT is now one of Meta's main competitors, but in the past two years, Meta has made a lot of money from Byte.
Domestic agents are helping ByteDance to advertise on Meta, and the performance of the Greater China region of Meta is also very good.
I haven't really looked into it, but I'm sure it won't be better than before.
The stage of Chinese companies burning money overseas has passed.
Third, the new traffic channels have not developed smoothly.
Facebook is getting older, and new platforms, including TT, are not in Meta's hands.
The biggest problem is not just the income decline, but the lack of growth expectations.
Capital markets don't just look at income, they look at what the future looks like.
Clearly, Meta's expectations are not high enough.
To tell a new story to the market, Zuckerberg spoke of the "metaverse."
The metaverse is indeed one of the directions of the future, but the implementation cycle of the metaverse is relatively long, and this story should not be able to support Meta's market value in two or three years.
So the next couple of years should be a pretty tough time for Meta.
Don't look at Facebook now, it's very glamorous, it has 100 billion to 200 billion dollars in revenue every year, but Facebook is actually very crisis-prone compared to other Internet companies and high-tech companies.
Although his several social software are now more popular and mainstream, such as Facebook, WhatsApp, etc., but facing the rapid development of tiktok, Facebook is not confident, and the subversion is just a blink of an eye.
And the concept of the metaverse, which is far-fetched and unattainable, has no hope of success in a short period of time, so Facebook is very dangerous, which is why Zuckerberg is changing the name of the company and is constantly looking for new tracks, but I think his choice of tracks is wrong, a dead end above are some of my thoughts for reference.
