The goods cost less than 20 euros.
The fee is 40% of the value of the goods....
I'm a #PRS_ORG# major customer so it's not a problem for me.
I just need a number or instruction on what to attach to the package so it can be tracked as a return.
I just ordered the #PRS_ORG# a few days ago... for $249.
Today, it costs 179€.
I find that rather annoying.
Do I have to cancel the order and re-order for the better price or is there another way of credit?
I also think that children should not be expected to take on the role of a parent for their younger siblings.
However, I think it is good for older siblings to care for their younger siblings in a measured way.
Look for a moment, help for a moment, bring the bottle, etc.
This teaches them responsibility, helps them in the family, and makes them involved.
As long as they can still be children, I don't see any problem.
If your K1 is alone for a little while and he's okay with it, that's good.
You can judge for yourself whether this is suitable for your children.
It's not like he's going to wrap K2 and watch him sleep for hours.
Legally, it is probably questionable.
Perhaps this explains the psychologist's statement.
Because if something were to actually happen, like a fire, burglary, earthquake, alien invasion, etc., it would actually be too much responsibility for K1 to take care of K2.
Whether that's a risk you want to take is, of course, up to you ;)
Please help me find the title of a book!
I remember reading a crime/thriller a few years ago and I can still remember almost the entire plot, but I can't remember the title, maybe someone here knows?
The story was about fear and how to overcome it.
At the beginning of the story, a zookeeper commits suicide by drowning himself in food and going into his predator's enclosure.
The case is taken over by a detective who, after a short investigation, turns to his therapist, who runs a clinic where he treats anxiety patients.
The commissioner has a little niece who is also afraid of fire and ends up with this therapist.
There are more suicides and there is another protagonist - a photographer who is assigned anonymously before each suicide to go to the site of the suicide and document it and post the photos on the internet.
At the end of the day, it turns out that this therapist is running an underground therapy group where patients are implanted with a chip that suppresses an anxiety center in the brain and ultimately allows them to face their fears in the most extreme way.
(One woman jumps out of a window, another drives herself to death on purpose)
This is what the book refers to as "the fight."
At the end, there's a big showdown at the hospital, which had to do with a fire.
That's how I'm pretty sure the book was originally written by a French author/author.
If anyone knows this action or can even tell me the title of the book, I would be very happy.
Oh, I don't have the Wi-Fi password.
I have to contact my husband first.
That can take a while.
What steps do I need to take afterwards?
Is it also possible to get the price difference refunded?
Child, 4 years old, splinter under the nail
The child, four years old, has splinters of wood under his thumbnail (outside) along its entire length.
They tried to pull him out with a pair of tweezers.
Very hard to reach.
It didn't work and it hurt.
Now the child is hysterically reacting when we try.
No chance now.
Tomorrow, I go to the doctor.

The LokSound 5 is the most important member of the LokSound family.
By combining the digital decoder and sound module on a printed circuit board, we achieve dimensions of only 30mm x 15.5mm and can therefore be installed in almost any H0 and 0 gauge locomotive.
LokSound 5 decoders are offered with all common interfaces and always come with a 11x15mm sugar cube speaker and sound capsule kit.
Like all family members, the LokSound5 is a true multi-protocol decoder.
He knows the DCC data format as well as Motorola®, Selectrix® and M4.
In the DCC format, 14 to 128 steps are as natural as 2- and 4-digit addresses and up to 32 functions.
Thanks to RailComPlus®, the decoders automatically connect to a suitable digital central station.
It masters all DCC programming modes and thanks to RailCom® it is possible to read the CV values on the main track with the appropriate control units.
For central offices that can only program 1-255 CVs, there are auxiliary registers.
Motorola® users benefit from up to 28 steps at 255 addresses.
Three additional Motorola® addresses allow the triggering of 16 functions.
A built-in programming mode also allows reprogramming with the venerable Control Unit 6021.
The M4 protocol allows automatic registration at mfx®-compatible central offices.
The LokSound 5 decoder recognizes Märklin® braking distances as well as ZIMO® HLU braking commands or the Lenz® ABC system.
Braking with DCC brake blocks or with DC power is also possible.
In addition, he also uses a Selectrix® brake diode.
An ABC pendulum train control system allows the train to automatically switch between two stations.
The LokSound 5 decoder can be used on analogue DC and AC lines.

Because of Omicron: Johnson wants to push for booster shots
Politicians and scientists in the UK are being kept on their toes by new Omicron cases.
By New Year, all eligible adults in England should have been offered a vaccine.
London - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to catch up with the pace of booster vaccinations against the backdrop of rapidly rising Omikron figures even faster than previously planned.
Every adult in England should be offered a booster dose by the end of the year if at least three months have passed since their second jab, Johnson said in a prerecorded video message to his countrymen on Sunday evening.
So far, the target date has been the end of January.
The UK government will also provide additional support to speed up the vaccination drive in parts of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
We are facing an emergency in the face of the Omicron variant, which is why the vaccine protection must be strengthened urgently, Johnson said.
The good news is that the protection level can be increased again with a third dose.
"Get boosted now!" Johnson said.
On Sunday, 1,239 more Omicron cases were registered in the UK, taking the total to 3,137.
Compared to the previous day, it was a 65 percent increase. dpa
Will the full amount be refunded to the buyer at the time of collection?
I'm for everyone using pronouns
I sent in an application.
Today, the invitation to a conversation came by mail.
I want to answer the e-mail.
Unfortunately, the name is not "Peter," but a somewhat more complicated name.
I googled him and depending on his/her cultural background, it's either a man or a woman.
**I have no idea how to write an e-mail now.
Can someone please help me?
** I'm an immigrant and I don't want to step on the feet of a civil servant.
Conclusion: Everyone should imagine using pronouns.
I have a total of five books on it.
Four of them go.
Only the one I bought today doesn't work
Apparently, the chair had a hidden flaw when it was sold.
How can such a pillow damage occur after 9 months otherwise?
First on the #PRS_ORG#.
But it has been working for about a year now.
Not for another 14 days.
That's why I've always bought the latest books online and then read them on the #PRS_ORG# website.
I bought 6 #PRS_ORG# but wanted to buy 8.
However, there were none.
Now they are back in stock and I would like to add two chairs to the order and invoice me for them.
[CW] The feeling when I can't help.
Content warning: I'm going to write a little bit more detail about domestic violence here.
I just need to write something about my soul.
I (21) come into contact with victims (and perpetrators) of domestic violence more often for professional reasons.
One theme that really nags at me and unfortunately is all too common is that many victims don't ask for help or think we can't help them.
I'm aware that we can't do everything and it's not perfect.
But there are fewer things in my profession that move me more than when I can't do anything in a situation like this.
I see the blue spots, the blood, the desperate eyes...
But even in a conversation with the perpetrator out of sight and sound, I can't reach everyone.
I don't know what the reason is, maybe it's fear, fear of revenge, fear of leaving the familiar social environment, fear of ripping the children out of it.
What I always want to make clear to everyone, sometimes even very close to tears, is that everyone deserves to be able to live without violence.
I want all women to know that they don't have to put up with violence.
I often wish I could help in any way... I know I can't.
But it will never be easy.
Please, always remember that you are worth living without violence, that is so incredibly important.
"Arcane" on Netflix: What does the series have to do with "League of Legends"?

Basketball Bundesliga: Derby disaster for MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg against Merlins Crailsheim
At least on Youngster Johannes Patrick, there was a lack of confidence.
Nothing again: For the second time in less than three months, the Giants lost in Crailsheim - and how!
Before the game, Ludwigsburg coach John Patrick said looking back on the cup defeat at the beginning of October at the Hakro Merlins Crailsheim: "We still have some anger in our stomachs."
However, it did not recover after the game - but rather increased in view of the 61:72 (28:38) defeat in the Basketball Bundesliga.
More disappointing than the naked result was the manner of the performance.
As a substitute, a statistic is cited that illustrates the whole dilemma: The three-point ratio was just 13 percent, 4 baskets (all of them by young Johannes Patrick) in 31 attempts - any questions?
The answer came from John Patrick: "We were not focused enough after the victory in Tenerife and did not implement what we had trained for."
That is, to move the ball.
His opposite number Sebastian Gleim reacted differently: "To win a great game against Ludwigsburg for the second time is a great achievement," said the happy coach.
"It felt like 10,000 people."
Only 750 visitors were allowed into the Hohenlohe Arena on Saturday, but they paid for it.
Not least because of BBL top scorer T.J. Shorts, who scored 22 points and steered his team.
"The best playmaker I've ever coached," Gleim said.
While Patrick's team saw its top performers like Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7) fail across the board.
Only in the last quarter (22:15) did the Giants prevent a total disaster and came as far as eight points after already being 39:59 behind.
In addition to Johannes Patrick, Justin Simon scored 12 points.
Unfortunately, there is still plenty of time to argue.
Already on Wednesday (7 p.m.) the giants receive the Skyliners Frankfurt, before then also in Ludwigsburg a maximum of 750 spectators.
We used to have a different email address, but I changed it.
Yes, I have already been in touch a few months ago.
Unfortunately, all warranty claims were rejected.
We have checked the law again and have therefore written to them again.
We signed up about six months ago.
Always like a boiled egg: Max Raabe turns 59
He can enthuse his audience with new interpretations of 1920s and 1930s hits.
He is currently on the "Good Morning, Good Luck" tour - if he can perform.
Actually, Max Raabe would have wanted to celebrate his birthday on the stage in Leipzig this Sunday.
But nothing comes of it.
The planned concert has been moved to May 2022 - "in accordance with official instructions" to contain the coronavirus.
Other concerts he had planned for the Advent season will have to be postponed, as stated on the website of the singer, who turns 59 today, and his musicians (www.palast-orchester.de).
From January, the artists will then try to catch up with their already postponed 2020 dates.
Born on December 12, 1962 in Lünen, North Rhine-Westphalia, Max Raabe has sung a lot and enjoyed it as a youth.
In Berlin he studied opera singing, in 1986 he founded the Palast Orchester together with fellow students.
Since then, the baritone has established itself with his repertoire of schlager and chanson songs in the style of the Comedian Harmonists.
He has been awarded many prizes.
His live album from the "MTV Unplugged" series (2019) reached - just like his successful album "Für Frauen ist das kein Problem" (2013) - the second place of the charts.
He has managed to make it from the niche to the mainstream.
Always elegantly dressed, his blonde hair carefully combed back and attentive to etiquette, Max Raabe is no longer to be found in the current German-speaking music scene.
With the programme "Guten Tag, liebe Glück", he has been on tour since 2020. dpa
Hello #NAME#, is it also possible to get a small sample of the furniture wood in advance?
It can be added to with existing furniture and so we can check beforehand whether it matches the colour
It still doesn't work, I can only yearn for the cover but I can't browse.
Federal Minister of Construction Klara Geywitz: The expropriation does not create new housing
The new Federal Minister of Construction, Klara Geywitz (SPD), has spoken out against the expropriation of large apartment complexes, as demanded in a referendum in Berlin.
"The expropriation does not create a single new apartment, only the ownership structure changes", said Geywitz in an interview with the "Tagesspiegel" (Sunday).
My goal is to give tenants peace of mind that their rent will remain affordable for years to come.
By the way, a colourful mix of for example private landlords, co-operatives or housing associations is the best protection against monopolisation.
In Berlin, the coalition of SPD, Greens and Left Party will set up an expert commission on how to deal with the result of the referendum.
However, if the situation does not improve, Geywitz did not rule out talks with the FDP in the Ampel coalition on further tightening of the rental law.
The coalition agreement provides for a rent cap until 2029, a cap on rent increases in tight housing markets and the expansion of the rent index.
I will speak with the Attorney General to get this done as quickly as possible.
If the rental market does not improve, "we will talk to the coalition partners about further steps," the SPD politician stressed.

At least 100 dead in Kentucky tornadoes
In a devastating storm system, numerous tornadoes have swept through the United States.
More than 100 deaths are possible in Kentucky alone.
The images from there are reminiscent of a war zone.
Tornadoes have caused severe damage in the United States on Saturday night, possibly killing up to 100 people.
The storms left behind a 320-mile-long (510 km) swath of devastation, mostly in the state of Kentucky.
Its governor, Andy Beshear, said after a visit to the disaster area that everything was gone everywhere the tornado had passed.
Houses, shops, government buildings - all gone.
Parts of industrial plants, roofs are in the trees.
It is hard to imagine that this is even possible.
He estimates as many as 100 deaths in the state of Kentucky alone, and the official numbers are rising by the hour.
Hi, I just saw that the Vitrine #NAME# is sold out.
That's very disappointing.
Is it still being produced?
Or is it completely removed from the range?
Is it possible to order this display case in another country?
When will you report back?
If the delivery cannot be made to my apartment, I must cancel the order!
I understand that, but can I order the ceiling now and have it delivered to Germany, which is in the shopping cart?
I had returned an article via the contact form and had requested a return and wanted to know if it had been received or processed, as I had not yet received a confirmation.
Firms pay for vaccine premiums and change advertising claims
While the federal government continues to reject the proposal for a vaccination bonus, companies in Austria have themselves taken the initiative and are offering their employees a vaccination bonus.
They are on the same line as the social partners ÖGB and the Chamber of Commerce, which today called for financial incentives for vaccination.
The transformation of advertising slogans into vaccination calls - after German model - is also intended to increase the willingness to get vaccinated against Corona.
He has moved to a company he has been slandering.
That doesn't make his situation any better than yours.
Wait and drink tea.
It's been a year.
He obviously didn't stick to his old job and has been looking for something else.
You can do that.
And that he didn't like you back then: well, that's fine.
He didn't like his job either.
There are too many variables.
Please cancel your reservation.
That will then be relevant in a legal sense.
I'm taking a screenshot.

Help with first own campaign
Boron to the rescue!
I'm currently running a group of four friends through Over the Greendale Pass, and I'd like to seamlessly bring my heroes into a campaign written specifically for the players.
We're playing DSA 5.
The big arc is done, the villains and their motivations are written, the individual acts are thought out and now I'm in the middle of writing the opening adventure and stumbling over my own feet from the very first encounter.
The premise is that the heroes are to bring a wagonload of grain from Gratenfels to a small village near Lake Thuran.
Here, the further course of action is to develop.
A few miles from the village, a group of goblins ambush the heroes and lure them into an ambush.
I want to give the player characters the option to deal with the confrontation in different ways: to persuade, to act, to threaten, to recognize the danger as early as possible, whatever the players come up with.
Group size: 8 ordinary goblins, 2 with spears, 6 with bows and swords
When unnoticed, the goblins ambush the hero in a ditch and flank him with three arrows each to the left and right, while two with spears stop the carriage.
If it comes to a fight and the heroes are defeated, I have two solutions
1. The heroes are all knocked unconscious and subsequently found and healed by the son of the village schoolmaster, a half-elf.
Of course, the cart is gone.
2. If defeat is inevitable, this half-elf intervenes with two of his servants and comes to the aid of the hero in battle.
The cart is still there, everything is great.
How appropriate is the deus ex machina of solution 2?
Is the Encounter too much of an introduction to the adventure?
The goblin group will later play a crucial role, so it's not just cannon fodder.
EDIT: Wow, I didn't expect so many answers, especially not so many great suggestions and tips.
I will guarantee that many of your ideas will be implemented, and now I also have more confidence in my narratives.
I took the lamp apart again.
And again, put together.
Unfortunately, it still doesn't work.
So I would like to send them back anyway
Can you then get the receipts back, then I can pack the lamp and bring it to #PRS_ORG#.

Will everything be collected or just the storage area?
I'm sick of Sky Sport F1
Hello dear F1 fans, over the course of the season the quality on German Sky has steadily declined, so I want to make a little air with this post.
First of all, the broadcast was interrupted today in the middle of the F2 race to allow the F1 preview to begin on time.
Although the schedule was far behind the plan due to the delayed start and the start accident, it would have been possible to show the last (planned) ten minutes and the championship decision!
Apparently, however, legal reasons mean that the F1 has priority and therefore everything else must be restricted, so that Sky DE had no choice here.
Still stupid, though, given that Sky UK broadcast the race to a close.
Nevertheless, a small compliment: the commentator Olivier Zwartyes has handled the difficult situation around the serious accident well.
Then there was again ignorance of the rules by the commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, as both did not know that you can change the tyres under a red flag.
Although this situation has already occurred at Imola, Baku and Silverstone this year, both only came to the conclusion that Verstappen should be allowed to change his tyres when there were corresponding radio messages about this to Hamilton.
Both commentators at Sky UK and RTL knew immediately that this was an option for Verstappen.
I think it's a basic rule that you should know when you're commentating on a pay-TV channel for Formula 1.
It's also not the first time that the rules have allowed or required a bit of guesswork, both of which just have persistent uncertainties about the rules.
In general, I don't like Roos's comment style, but I have to admit that it's a matter of taste.
But I like Heiko Wasser from RTL even better.
There are also the constant absurdities, which both simply look unprofessional, like ordering coffee from the (equally clueless) reporter Peter Hardenacke or "UuuuuHD" by Ralf Schumacher.
The latter, on the other hand, brings a lot of unease to the comment, which he apparently does not take seriously.
Not least, the adverts simply take over on Sky, in the final round, Sky is the only channel that goes into the adverts, as you can hear on F1TV, because you have to listen to the German soundtrack without commentary directly after the race.
Neither ServusTV nor ORF are doing this.
These two channels also do less advertising than Sky, and that as a free-to-air channel.
Glock and Baumgartner should be praised for their work, but that alone does not make me overlook the disadvantages.
Sky Sport F1's other programme is also very sparse and full of repeats.
In total, Sky is really the worst German-language channel to broadcast F1.
Unironically, RTL does a better job with the four races they are still allowed to broadcast, except for the commercials.
In fact, the grandiose F1 season is a lot less fun than it would be with a decent broadcaster.
I would like to know what you think.
On this one: #PRS_ORG# pendulum light, brass and multicolored glass x 1
Hi, I have an item that was supposed to be delivered last week and it still hasn't been delivered.
I have contacted the chat twice and so far nothing.
The First Lady told me it would be sent out on Monday, the Second Lady told me yesterday that she would check and send an email and she never did.
Hi, I ordered two #PRS_ORG# on 12/12/19.
One of them has already shown a defect (the fabric has a hole in the front part of the chair).
I'm asking for help.
Air pumps are ideal for supplying an aquarium with additional oxygen.
It is also possible to operate a filter system using air hoppers.
This series is offered in three variants by us.
Look at the table at the end of the offer.
Here you can see the performance figures.
If the pumps are strong enough, you can run an entire plant with them.
If you have a large aquarium, pumps with two or more outlets are suitable so that you can connect more than one outlet.
The MK series has one, two or four outlets, depending on the model, but there are also fan pumps available to set an accent in the aquarium, e.g. with an air curtain (find them in our shop) or with a decor that turns the air bubbles into a function.
Here would be a treasure chest, a mussel or something like that.
The MK series has a special, sound-insulated construction and so ensures low operating noise.
The installation is very easy.
The fan pump is connected to an air hose 4/6 mm by means of an air valve... and then it can go.
The fan pump should be the same or higher than the water level and mounted on the outside.
If the fan pump is lower than the water level, a check valve should be installed between them.
Just cut the air hose and put the valve in between.
This would prevent if the water were to run backwards, the water from the pool running through the pump...
If the fan pump is to be installed outdoors, it should be covered and protected from moisture
The MK pumps are pure power packages that consume little energy
Even though we list the processing time here on eBay at 3 days, the packages are packed every day and the packages are picked up here every day.
If everything goes well, it goes very quickly.
We just want to take a little precaution so that no one is offended just because it took a little longer once.
It would be like this, not everyone has understanding for all the employees who also work in the shipping industry...of course, Corona doesn't stop here.
Please do not rate it badly just because the delivery is delayed, that is entirely the fault of the parcel services.
Of course, people like to complain about these services, even though we say...they're having a hard time right now.
This is also very different regionally.
Don't be mean to anyone, stay healthy, and we all hope for better times to come.
How long does it take to order the yellow ones with and without armrests?
Can you also order the legs in white here?
Amazon founder Bezos sends astronaut daughter and host into space
The daughter of the first American in space, a TV host and four other passengers have taken a short trip into space.
They were transported on Saturday by the New Shepard rocket system of Blue Origin, the company founded by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.
The ten-minute flight took off and landed in the western US state of Texas.
Under a bright blue sky, Bezos personally welcomed the newly-minted astronauts upon their return.
"Welcome back," said Bezos, dressed in a blue spacesuit as he opened the hatch to the capsule.
Under the applause of friends, family members and Blue Origin employees, the six passengers slowly climbed out and embraced the Amazon founder.
According to Blue Origin, they flew for ten minutes and 13 seconds and reached an altitude of 107 kilometers.
The 74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of the 1961 NASA astronaut Alan Shepard (1923-1998), after whom the rocket system of Blue Origin is named, and the 50-year-old TV presenter Michael Strahan were guests of the company, and the other four passengers had paid for their tickets: space engineer Dylan Taylor, investor Evan Dick, technology entrepreneur Lane Bess and his son Cameron.
Blue Origin did not disclose how much each person paid for their ticket.
Laura Shepard Churchley recalled her father's mission after the short flight.
He worked hard on his missions and had to do everything himself.
She just flew along, said the 74-year-old with a laugh.
Michael Strahan also expressed enthusiasm.
He would like to go back to space as soon as possible, said the moderator.
New Shepard flies up to 100 km
The rocket system "New Shepard" is largely automated.
The capsule separated from the rocket during the flight and reached an altitude of about 100 kilometers above the Earth, briefly in zero gravity, before the reusable object was slowed down by large parachutes and landed again.
The International Air Transport Association and many other experts consider 100 kilometers above the earth as the boundary to space, but there is no binding international regulation.
It was Blue Origin's third manned flight: the first in July was Amazon founder Bezos himself, along with his brother Mark, an 82-year-old former U.S. pilot, and an 18-year-old Dutchman.
The second in October was attended by the 90-year-old Canadian actor William Shatner, who became famous for his role as "Captain Kirk" in "Star Trek", as well as former NASA engineer Chris Boshuizen, entrepreneur Glen de Vries and Blue Origin's deputy chief executive Audrey Powers.
Critics accuse Bezos and Blue Origin of pushing the space tourism business largely without scientific research interests for the benefit of humanity and without regard for the climate.

Someone who works in biochemistry or is studying biochemistry
I am currently studying biochemistry in the first semester and find the subject itself quite interesting, and I do not mind working in the lab (I have already completed the inorganic chemistry practical).
I have also been informed about career prospects before I started studying, but at that time I was still thinking that I would definitely study until I got my doctorate.
At the moment, however, I have doubts, especially about my career prospects.
On one side (Studycheck etc) you hear all the time about great career opportunities and the job is totally in demand, on the other side you hear all the time about unemployed biologists and incredibly poorly paid jobs.
So I would really like to know:
1) What is she currently working on?
2) Are you satisfied with your work/salary?
3) What did you study/ What training have you done?
4) Would you do it all again?
Thank you for your answers!
I'm currently really unsure and am thinking about dropping out of college in 2022 and training to be a computer scientist.
If you have any experience, they also like to write :)
Extra stress before holidays and holiday weekends
This topic came up with me last week.
But now I had to use my long weekend to relax.
That's why I'm putting up a post about it now.
Not only during major holidays, such as Christmas holidays, there is great stress in our company.
Apparently, there are those before holidays plus bridge days.
It was like this: Last week was the Ascension of Mary, which is called "Auffahrt" in Switzerland.
On Friday, the vast majority of people and businesses make a bridge day, which is semi-official.
Last week, it was a long four-day weekend at home.
So what happened last week?
Everywhere stress.
Lots of e-mails that had to be sent out before the driveway, order here, order there, all *absolutely* before the long weekend.
Because... well, why?
Because "next week" sounds like so much time and it can't be?
Or because people really want to do as much in a shortened week as they do in a normal one?
Not only was I stressed on Wednesday, but I was also very nervous.
What is this self-pity for holidays?
Why do we have holidays if we can't enjoy them properly?!
The stress didn't come from above, the colleagues were all completely independent of it.
My question is simply: Are we, the Swiss, the only ones like this?
Is that our Reformed Evangelical way?
Or do you know that in the north as well?
Yvonne Catterfeld looks forward to Christmas in Thuringia
Yvonne Catterfeld (42) is looking forward to Christmas in her home state of Thuringia - but has no presents yet.
"The beautiful thing is that even if there is no snow in Erfurt, you just drive to Ilmenau in the Thuringian Forest," said the actress and singer Hit Radio FFH.
She'll tune in to the festivities by baking and building with her son.
"I love it," said Catterfeld.
But until the contemplative days, she still has a lot to do: "For the first time, I have no gifts, I have to start now."
NEKTON-Bio supports a smooth course of the moult and feather growth.
NEKTON-Bio contains all the essential vitamins, amino acids, minerals, trace elements and 200,000 µg of biotin/kg.
NEKTON-Bio gives the bird a smooth and shiny plumage.
The majority of avian husbandry-related injuries are solely due to dietary errors.
Since the plumage is made up of protein-containing substances, a particularly rich and balanced protein diet for the bird is a prerequisite for the formation of a perfect feather coat.
For a functioning metabolism, the daily diet must contain enough vitamins, minerals and trace elements.
Most of the animal losses that occur during the moult are due to inadequate or unbalanced protein intake and/or inadequate supply of vitamins and minerals.
The composition of NEKTON-Bio takes into account and compensates for the unfavourable amino acid ratio in most plant-based feedstuffs.
No other vitamin preparations should be administered while taking NEKTON-Bio.
NEKTON Bio is cold water soluble and can easily be administered via drinking water or soft food.
Thank you, I found it
Unfortunately, it still doesn't work
DDR-Handarbeitsmodell Altbau E-Lok E 95 03 DRG/ DR, die Lok war in Schlesien und Mitteldeutschland im Einsatz, die sehr seltene Lok stammt wahrscheinlich aus dem Umbauvorschlag des Modelleisenbahners ME Heft 11/1968, gebraucht mit Spielspuren und Fehlteilen, siehe Fotos, Funktion gut, Die Baureihe E 95 ist eine schwere Güterzug-Elektrolokomotive der Deutschen Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft (DRG), die für die Traktion schwerer Kohleganzzüge im schlesischen Netz konzipiert worden ist, womöglich stammt der Bausatz auch aus der Kleinserienfirma ZSCHUTSCHKE und BACHMANN.
A locomotive is in the DB Museum Halle (Saale) and has been restored to working order
In 1924, the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft had commissioned AEG to submit proposals for an electric locomotive capable of hauling 2,200-ton coal trains and 530-ton passenger trains at a cruising speed of 45 km/h on this line.
A maximum speed of 65 km/h was required.
Thus, the DRG decided in March 1926 to deliver the mechanical part as a 1'Co+Co1' locomotive with Tatzlager drive from AEG, and the electrical part from Siemens-Schuckertwerke.
From December 1927 to June 1928, six locomotives were delivered, which received the operating numbers E 95 01–06.
All survived the Second World War and found themselves again on the territory of the future GDR.
In 1946, the locomotives were sent to the Soviet Union as reparations.
They returned to Germany by November 1952.
The serviceability of all six locomotives was found to be satisfactory at the Reichsbahnausbesserungswerk Dessau.
[4] As the electrification of the Mitteldeutsche Netz progressed, a growing demand for locomotives for the heavy goods train service led to the overhaul of the three locomotives E 95 01 to E 95 03 in 1959, with the remaining machines serving as spare parts donors.
First, the E 04, E 44 and E 94, which were available in larger quantities, were preferred.
Only when it became clear that the number of repairs would not be increased further with the E 94, did the E 95 come back into focus of the repair work.
[4] Initially, the locomotives were stationed at the Leipzig-Wahren railway depot.
They came to the railway workshop Halle P. in 1960.
They were used in their own circuit, mostly in the direction of Halle, Leipzig and Erfurt, before coal trains from the Geiseltal.
With increasing age, the complex control of the locomotives became problematic.
This often happened that shooters would stick to their positions when they were in the firing line.
Then, the on-board helper, who was constantly traveling on this locomotive, had to release the trigger while the train was in motion with a hammer and a wooden mallet.
Damage to the traction engines often occurred and led to months of locomotive downtime.
[5] Since there were enough new locomotives available at the end of the 1960s and an expansion of the electric operation was not planned at the time, the Reichsbahn was able to do without old locomotives and most split types, so that the E 95 was taken out of service.
In addition, Deutsche Reichsbahn wanted to operate only one-man electric locomotives, which would have resulted in problems in train operation due to the difficulties with the machines and the visibility from the driver's cab.
[5] After mid-1969, the E 95 02 and E 95 03 were withdrawn, followed by the E 95 01, which left service on 5 October 1970.
The proposed new designation 255 001 was therefore never used.
All the locomotives except the E 95 02 have been dismantled.
The E 95 02 was set up as a switch heater for the future museum locomotive E 77 10 at the main station in Halle.
It took some time before the Reichsbahn officials were convinced that the E 95 was worth saving as a museum locomotive.
In 1979, the locomotive's initial external restoration began with the aim of being able to present it at a vehicle show at the RAW Dessau.
[5] Since then, it has been part of the Dresden Transport Museum as a non-operational museum locomotive.
In 1986, the internal completion of the locomotive was completed.
The locomotive is maintained as a museum in the DB Museum Halle (Saale).
Since 1995, employees of the tradition community Bw Halle P have been working on the operational refurbishment of the locomotive.
In April 2015, the locomotive could be presented for the first time at an exhibition in the museum workshop Arnstadt with new interior and exterior paintwork, where the transformers were checked and five drive motors were operational.
-The locomotives were in use on the Silesian Mountain Railway and the branch lines until 1945, where they proved their reliability and low maintenance.
In February 1945, the machines were moved to Leipzig to the central German network.
The main area of operation was initially Silesia
H0 hand-made model in OVP, good function, optical rework of the locomotive is necessary, dusted, with play tracks, cellar smell !!!, very rare hand-made model, very small edition - possibly the kit comes from the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN
The packages may have labels and storage marks.
Yes, the F-parts are it
I received a bed from you.
However, there were problems with one part.
The middle beam is held up by two feet...unfortunately these are too narrow and the beam cannot be mounted on the feet.
What are we going to do now?
I can't put the bed together.
The middle beam is held up by two feet, which are unfortunately faulty.
The middle beam doesn't fit into the intended bracket.
So I get new ones sent to me.
When will they be released?
No, they're not flat.
These are, according to the assembly instructions, the right ones, they were just too narrow
But that doesn't matter.
As long as they serve their purpose
They're not flat with me
Could I get this sent to me?
Hello #NAME#, can I explain the problem to you again?
Residential fire with two minor injuries and high damage
Two people were slightly injured in a fire in a house in Upper Bavaria.
In addition, an estimated damage in the six-digit euro range has been incurred, the police reported on Sunday.
The fire had apparently spread from a carport to the adjacent residential building in Kinsau (district of Landsberg am Lech).
Two residents were reportedly taken to hospital on Sunday with mild smoke inhalation.
The exact cause of the fire was not known at first, but the police did not assume that it had been deliberately set.
The Fürstenfeldbruck Kripo has taken over the further investigations.
But it comes later
And I have to pay shipping again
To debunk fake news - Biontech CEO releases vaccine photo
Uğur Şahin posted a photo of his first vaccination on the social network "LinkedIn" in January 2021
Biontech CEO Uğur Şahin has not publicly commented on his vaccination status.
Now the entrepreneur has published a photo showing his corona vaccination.
His friend's illness prompted him to speak out, Şahin said.
The CEO and co-founder of the Mainz-based company Biontech, Uğur Şahin, has published a photo showing him receiving a coronavirus vaccine.
On social media, there were false claims that I was allegedly not vaccinated.
In fact, my wife and I have received three doses of the Biontech-Pfizer vaccine," Şahin wrote in a post on the network "LinkedIn" on Friday.
"For months, friends have been urging me to post a picture of me getting vaccinated to combat these false rumors."
So far, he has refused because he doesn't want the communication to revolve around him.
But a phone call last week has changed his mind: "I was deeply saddened to learn that an old school friend of mine is currently fighting for his life.
He is fighting a severe COVID-19 infection and has been on a ventilator for three weeks.
The school friend and his family were not vaccinated, Şahin wrote.
He didn't ask why.
"The most common cause, however, appears to be fear, which is often fuelled by misinformation and mistrust."
Fear can only be fought with facts, sometimes it is better to share personal experiences.
An interview with Deutsche Welle is circulating on the internet in which Uğur Şahin says he is not vaccinated.
However, the video was created in December 2020, as the Deutsche Welle itself clarified.
"I am currently not allowed to get the vaccine myself," Şahin said at the time.
There is a prioritization of vaccination in Germany.
Now, the prioritisation has long been cancelled - and Biontech's boss has been vaccinated three times according to his own statements.
Fire in substation: Tens of thousands of people without power
In several municipalities in North Rhine-Westphalia, the lights went out on Friday evening: no electricity and, in many cases, no heating either.
A fire had rendered a substation inoperable.
Tens of thousands of people in the Rhein-Sieg district of North Rhine-Westphalia had to go without electricity for around 24 hours after a fire at a substation.
On Friday evening, 41,000 residents and residents in several municipalities turned off the lights as a result of the fire.
Westnetz reported that on Saturday, numerous emergency generators were in operation until the widespread disturbance was finally resolved late in the evening.
Firefighters and helpers and helpers of the THW provided support in the municipalities.
Authorities offered school-based care and called for neighbors to help.
The supplier thanked the victims for their patience and the helpers for their efforts.
We are very aware that the last 24 hours have brought significant restrictions.
We also thank the affected municipalities, the district, the fire departments and the THW for their tireless efforts," said Florian Witt, head of the primary technology division, in a statement on Saturday evening.
The repair of the damage will take a few more days, as the Westnet installers were only able to bring back some of the lines temporarily, he explained.
The fire was caused by a technical defect, according to the company.
Electricity is flowing again
The fire, which broke out at about 19.15 on Friday, has severely damaged parts of the 10,000-volt switchgear at the Neunkirchen-Seelscheid substation, according to Westnetz.
There are extensive cleaning and repair works to be carried out.
At the same time, a connection to a 30,000-volt voltage level was created.
With this bypass, the power supply is restored.
Since Saturday 6 p.m., over 21,000 people in Much and Ruppichteroth have had their electricity restored.
Another 20,000 residents of Neunkirchen-Seelscheid were gradually connected from 21.30 p.m.
Since 23:15, the last of the last people affected by the outage have also had power.
Over 80 Westnetz and partner company installers were on the scene.
Authorities had also called for neighbourhood assistance after setting up an emergency power supply for important buildings on Saturday afternoon.
"It is now important that citizens look after their neighbours and report to the local fire station if help is needed," said Landrat Sebastian Schuster (CDU) after a crisis meeting.
When setting up and operating emergency power generators, the focus was on the residents of nursing homes.
In addition, according to the authorities, temporary care facilities have been set up in schools for those people who were unable to care for themselves or who required medical devices that were not battery-operated, or who required medical care.
Guten Tag!
Unfortunately, the ceiling is sold out in Germany.
Can I buy them from you and pay in euros?
It is the #PRS_ORG# day cover in blue-green.
I hope you have a nice day and stay healthy ♡
But I can't mount the bottom on the table top.
It is Custom #NAME#.
There are three types of this.
We wanted those with tabletops with a diameter of #NUMBER#
We received 155 cm in diameter.
Today my #PRS_ORG# arrived, however I can't fit them together and thus shorten them.
Can you help me with that?
Otherwise I would have to return it, because otherwise it would not be suitable for the purpose.
I would appreciate a reply
Yes, that's really easy!
Then we do it like this!
Can you send me the return receipt by email?
The repair is now complete.
I had already tried this before the chat.
However, I hadn't restarted the e-#PRS_ORG# before I bought it.
Should I do that now?
I find it almost insulting to get such a low score.
We are not in agreement with that
Nordic combined: Kombiner Riiber wins
The German Nordic combiners Fabian Rießle and Julian Schmid have sprinted to the podium at the World Cup in Otepää, Estonia.

I also have to work!
To ensure a uniform and clean paint job, you should clean the components with soapy water from dust, grease, and fingerprints, rinse with clear water, and dry.
Before you use the brush for the first time with a new colour, it is advisable to practice 2 to 3 strokes.
You can do this on the inside of the components that are not visible or on a yogurt cup.
The first mark on the component
Draw the brush evenly, stroke by stroke.
Later, slight overlap of the paint layers results in an even surface.
Avoid quick back and forth wiping with the brush.
This results in unrealistic areas.
A model is not a fence.
Start with the bright colours.
The dark ones could then later show through.
Metallic tones and metallic colours come at the very end with a separate brush.
Otherwise, it can result in unsightly metallic flecks when mixed with normal colours.
Allow the painted parts to dry for a day before varnishing.
The models achieve their original appearance through decals or decals.
From aircraft insignia to ship names to license plates and license plates on car models: The decals give the model the final touch.
Bring the decals in the correct order, while the components are still easy to reach.
An aircraft cockpit can be or is easier to cover before it is installed in the fuselage.
More important than the right tool, like scissors, tweezers and a toothpick, is time, patience and a steady hand.
Cut out each decal you need and arrange them accordingly.
Decals are also called water slides because you briefly wet the back of the decal with water until the backing paper turns dark from the moisture.
Then you just slide the picture a little bit off the paper and place the piece on the corresponding place on the model (which you also moistened beforehand).
While holding the decal in place on the model with a tool, pull the backing paper away from the side.
Caution: Always check that the image is in the right place before you remove it completely from the paper, so that it doesn't stick, wrinkle or even tear.
Excess water is absorbed by a household towel.
Warning not suitable for children under 3 years
I can only open a book for a short time when I look for something else, then I don't read the book anymore and have to log in and out and load the book again and look for where I left off.
On Saturday, I already communicated with you.
Can I get this by email?
For all three packages?
Because the lamp came in three separate packages to me
Thank you anyway!
Then I'll buy elsewhere as soon as the money comes back.
But can I get it back without a problem?
Infertility treatment with PKV / What is a "insurance case"?
Hello everyone,
We had been in fertility treatment for some time, and now that it's time to settle the account with the PKV, this comes as a shock.
In order:
We had applied for the wish for a child in advance at the PKV and received the approval for three attempts.
The experiments were not restricted in any way (e.g. time frame, success, etc.).
The first attempt led directly to a successful pregnancy and birth and was paid for with the PKV.
Some time later, we tried to have another child, and we did two (unsuccessful) attempts, but we didn't count the PKV.
We applied again for reimbursement from the PKV and were granted three more attempts.
After a few more attempts (we have carried out more tests than promised, of course the most expensive ones pay off with the PKV) we submitted the invoices to the PKV and got the nasty surprise: instead of 5 attempts (2+3), the PKV only wants to pay for 3 attempts.
The reason: With the pregnancy/birth, the remaining 2 attempts of the first commitment are voided.
The second child wish is a new insurance case.
However, according to the AGB, "the insurance case begins with the treatment and ends when treatment is no longer required."
The questions to the experts in the round here:
* Who is right, the PKV (only 3 trials are reimbursed) or we (there are 5 trials to be reimbursed)?
* Would the PKV have informed us in the promises that with a birth the further attempts would fail?
* Is the desire for a second child really a new insurance case?
Infertility (caused by blocked fallopian tubes) is not cured by the first child.
It would be great if the experts here would give their opinion.
Thank you very much for your help!
Can you please email me the three options and tell me how I can best reach you
Okay.
We will no longer order anything from them.
If they add up the sales of me and my friend #NAME# (same address), they've obviously lost a good customer.
They are happy to pass this on to their manager.
That's not competitive.
Yesterday, my colleague told me that the repayment was arranged and now you tell me that I have to return the thing.
I can't help it if the commode comes to me in a complete mess
Please see the screenshot what the colleague wrote
It is clearly stated that the refund has been initiated and I have still not received the refund via #PRS_ORG#
They can tell their manager that they've now lost two regulars.
My friend also ordered various furniture for our apartment through his account.
We won't do that anymore.
No, the defect only appeared after a few months.
An office chair must be able to withstand normal use.
Otherwise, they can't sell it as an office chair.
Regardless of this, the guarantee is valid for 24 months.
No, I am unable to obtain another type of packaging.
I will dismantle the cabinet and make it available to the transport company.
Guten Tag, ich habe eine Frage zu Ihrer Serie von #PRS_ORG#
These products are advertised with additional stools to be purchased, but unfortunately we cannot find them with you.
Can they help?
Topic of the week: The best low budget films
What a low-budget film is, there is no general definition with exact budget limits.
Wikipedia has this to say about it:
A **low-budget film** or **low-budget movie** is a motion picture shot with little to no funding from a major film studio or private investor.
There are plenty of lists of low-budget films online, such as Letterboxd.com.
Do you know any interesting representatives of this category?
What excites you about that?
And what do you not like at all?
I am a very good customer of yours, and I have already furnished two apartments completely with your furniture.
Wanted to get the best price for the grey leather sofa Odelle.
The delivery time has now been extended again, is it now also reliable?
Thank you
Yours sincerely
There's no phone number, a chat where you have to wait 30 minutes is not a chat!
Unfortunately, nothing changes in the waiting position... I give up again soon because it just doesn't work here.
Hello
"Half-hearted victory" against Belarus with high costs for the EU
According to political expert Raphael Bossong, the EU can declare a "half victory" in the conflict with the Belarusian regime.
However, the costs were very high and meant massive violations of the rights of migrants and refugees at the Belarus border with Poland and Lithuania, Bossong told the Evangelical Press Service (epd).
The EU has not been able to resolve the confrontation, the researcher of the Berlin Foundation for Science and Politics (SWP) explained.
This state of suspended animation - Belarus is not giving up at all, but the EU feels like a winner - is likely to continue for some time.
The treatment of people at the border was not in line with the European Convention on Human Rights, Bossong said.
Apparently, there is an "increasing normalization of pushbacks" by individual EU governments.
Since the EU as a whole is not determined to oppose it, this is at the expense of fundamental rights.
This development also weakens the unity of the Union.
"It can't work if a member state thinks it can do its own thing," said Poland, which does not even allow Frontex, the EU border agency, access to its border.
In addition, the EU pays a further price for its border policy with Belarus, says Bossong: The line "border guard, border guard, border guard" has been strengthened, making it more difficult to reach an agreement on asylum policy.
Another attempt to cross the border
According to the Polish border guard, migrants have again tried to enter Polish territory through Belarus.
Fifty-five migrants were detained overnight on Sunday and returned to the border, a spokeswoman for the authority said on Sunday.
The Polish officials were pelted with stones by the migrants not far from the town of Czeremsza during the incident.
According to reports, a soldier was hit in the face and had to be medically treated by a military doctor.
In total, the border guard recorded 52 attempted border crossings within 24 hours.
On Friday evening, a group of 28 migrants had already broken through the border barriers.
Thousands of people from countries like Iraq and Afghanistan have crossed or attempted to cross the Belarus-EU border in recent months.
The EU accuses Alexander Lukashenko, the ruler of Minsk, of luring them with the promise of entry into the EU.
According to reports, Poland and Lithuania have sealed off their borders.
The EU sanctioned Belarus and threatened airlines that brought migrants and refugees into the country.
In addition, EU commissioners travelled to the countries of origin of the people to prevent them from leaving.
The most effective element of the EU's response was the pressure on the airlines, said Bossong.
"The EU has thrown its market power into the balance and demonstrated its resolve with hard bandages and extraterritorial sanctions."
Minsk must also take into account the domestic costs.
The Belarusian society is not set up to allow the security apparatus to regularly transport thousands of people through the country.
Mercedes protests after controversial Formula 1 finale
According to Mercedes, Max Verstappen committed two rule violations during the race.
Abu Dhabi - Following the controversial Formula One finale in Abu Dhabi, Mercedes has lodged an appeal.
The Silver Arrows suspect two rule breaches in the last Grand Prix of the year.
A protest relates to a supposed infringement by Max Verstappen at Red Bull in the final Safety Car phase, when he is said to have overtaken illegally.
A second appeal was lodged against the judgement at the end of the race.
According to Mercedes, the protocol was not followed.
Verstappen overtook Lewis Hamilton in the Mercedes on the final lap to take his first Formula One title.
The manoeuvre took place shortly after the end of a safety car phase in which the Dutchman had overtaken cars in front of him.
I'll check that.
I'm talking to the bank and I'll get back to you
Thank you for the support
Free admission for members: Europa-Park hosts SC Freiburg fantag
The Europa-Park, the name-giver for the Europa-Park Stadium of the Sport-Club Freiburg, has invited SC Freiburg fans.
According to the park, members and permanent cardholders of the sports club from the Breisgau as well as members of the fan community were allowed to visit the Europa-Park free of charge on that day.
In addition, there were vouchers for drinks and sausages.
On this day, the roller coaster trains shone through the jerseys in red and white.
Foxes, the Euromouse and many red and white balloons provided the perfect backdrop," the park said.
The cooperation between the Bundesliga club and the leisure park in Rust, 40 kilometres north of Freiburg, has been in place since the early 1990s.
The first SC Freiburg Fantag in the Europa-Park has once again shown how well the partnership fits.
Seeing the radiant fans having fun together on the roller coaster confirms this," says Europa-Park owner Jürgen Mack.
Why is it €#NUMBER# and not like the original €1699?

Judith Hermann read from her novel "Home"
As part of the reading series "LiteraTour Nord", author Judith Hermann read from her current novel "Daheim" at the sold-out Blue Note on Friday and served as a moderator.
She is divorced, lives in a house by the coast and listens sensitively to the night noises at her front door.
I left the contact form to return an item yesterday, but I haven't received an email confirmation or anything like that.
My question is whether my request has been received.
Not everyone has the time for your messed up chat and cheap goods from China.
Their mistake, which they will correct and not all of ours.
Contact Mrs #NAME#.
I can't chat with them every day
We chatted yesterday and agreed that I or Mrs #NAME# would receive an email with a 60 euro voucher, a new order of the #PRS_ORG# nightstand and a return label.
This email has not come through yet.
The package is still to be brought to #PRS_ORG# today.
Please contact me
Yours sincerely

Sorry but just because he says he's not anti-Semitic doesn't mean anything.
It's like when a foreigner says he doesn't have anything against foreigners.
Neither of them will admit it.
But Kollegah constantly reproduces anti-Semitic messages.
If you want to distance yourself, then you should just do it completely.
Yes, then you are just as little serious as Kollegah.
Anyone who takes evolution seriously is simply lost.
Somehow, a god got involved.
But once you become a creationist, you have to believe that the Earth is 10,000 years old and that science is full of nonsense.
And that makes you an enemy of science and not to be taken seriously as Kollegah
To achieve an optimal field of vision, the lens should be as close as possible to the eye.
The specially designed aplanatic-achromatic lens system allows you to use the microscope practically error-free right up to the edge zone.
Magnifying glasses are often marked with magnification figures.
However, these figures only apply to precisely defined conditions, which rarely correspond to the conditions of use.
In order to make the most of your loupe, we ask you to pay attention to the information in the "Technical data" table (see instructions for use in the packaging).
Light reflections are created on the lens surfaces of all optical devices, including impact lenses.
Anti-reflective coatings significantly reduce these reflections.
Reflections on the lens surfaces are less noticeable if the optimal use conditions are observed - the lens close to the eye.

I have already reported to you under customer contact with the number #PHONENUMBER#.
Yes, but it was said before.

Christmas tree sales in Schönwolde: In the municipality of Krembz, women are looking for Christmas trees
Farmer Frank Diers has already experienced a number of curious situations when selling Christmas trees.
One man even drove home alone once because he and his partner could not agree.
Every year, he plants about 2,000 of them.
The 56-year-old has already experienced many curious situations.
That makes the run-up to Christmas a little more fun, he says.
And with the voucher?
Otherwise I'm out as a customer?!
After all, I received a defective delivery and now paid the full price for it.
Then I will also evaluate it accordingly!
We don't need to argue about which court is better, but there is a certain similarity between the two.
Both consist of meat that is grilled on a rotating spit.
And both have their names.
In German, an equivalent might be something like the "Dreher", which doesn't sound nearly as tasty.
Problems with fiber optic + Devolo DLan/Magic
We have had a new fibre optic connection in the house for a few weeks.
Unfortunately, I have problems building a stable Wi-Fi network.
Previously, I had a DSL 50 Mbit connection and used Devolo DLan, which received and sent 50 Mbit without any problems, except for a few glitches.
The new fibre optic connection sends 500 Mbit to the FritzBox 7590 and the DLan module connected to the FritzBox also receives these.
However, the other DLan module, which sends the Wi-Fi, no longer receives the full 500, but the further away I am in the house from the module, the less it receives (so I use a socket that is 1, 2, 3, etc. rooms away from the other module).
This means that the Internet with the new fiber connection is now even slower on the first floor than before (~45 Mbit).
I also ordered a new Devolo Magic set, which apparently uses a new technology.
This was slightly better than the DLan, but here too there were similar losses.
Could someone explain why fiber optic is "losing" so much internet speed over the power line?
And is LAN really the only solution?
It would be extremly time-consuming to lay LAN cables in the house.
I'm really desperate, which is why I've set up an account here.
Therefore, I would like to receive an answer more than ever.
When it's time to change the Giro account
Anyone who thought that the Giro accounts would be quiet for a while now is being fooled.
While many banks have used the autumn to remind their customers of past fee hikes with all sorts of tricks, negative interest rates are also falling further.
For example, Deutsche Bank was considered relatively generous with a limit of 100,000 euros for a long time.
Now she has halved the allowance and even quartered the daily pay.
In the first step, the limit was lowered only for customers of the Postbank division of the group - to 50,000 euros for current and savings accounts and to 25,000 euros for day-to-day accounts.
However, the lower thresholds now apply to the entire Deutsche Bank, as a spokesman confirmed in response to a request.
And not only for new contracts, but also for "new individual agreements with existing customers".
The Commerzbank had already gone down to a limit of 50,000 euros, which still applies, as does that of ING Germany.
The direct bank DKB, which is particularly popular with cost-conscious customers, has reduced the free amounts in two stages, initially to 50,000 euros, and now to 25,000 euros.
After all, more than 100 banks have now reached a credit limit of 25,000 euros or less, according to figures from the Internet portal Verivox.
The Sparda Bank Berlin has also arrived at 25,000 euros: However, there is still a legal dispute with the consumer centres, which in the first instance won against this regulation at the Berlin Land Court.
Now, banks are already discussing whether the institutions should set aside reserves - in the event that the higher authorities also declare the negative interest rates in principle to be unlawful and many millions of bank customers must be repaid.
The table top for 8 people was delivered instead of the one for 6 people.
The lower one is for 6 people.
Jennifer Aniston has a whole beauty army
She is now officially at the top of Hollywood.
But their lives are like a roller coaster ride.
Jennifer Aniston (52) was voted the most influential woman of the year by the US magazine "The Hollywood Reporter".
For her, the success in 2021 with the "Friends" reunion and the continuation of her series "The Morning Show" was above all the result of a lot of discipline and work.
Its appearance is taken care of by an army of assistants, stylists and trainers.
After all, says Aniston, she treats herself to a chip a day (yes, that's right: a single chip from the bag).
That they should both fall in love with her hearts is really a miracle.
Maybe because she's just unlucky with the luck - and still looking for the love of her life.
And the baby wish from the list has been crossed out.
She was constantly asked when she would become a mother.
That hurt her.
The people who asked have no idea what's wrong with me medically, why I can't.
It was really hurtful.
It remains to be hoped that success and fame will also bring happiness.
An ignominious end to a career: Räikkönen must give up
Kimi Räikkönen's departure from Formula 1 was quieter than expected.
Abu Dhabi - The 42-year-old Finn took off his gloves and wiped sweat from his forehead.
That was it.
After a driving error and a slight contact with a barrier, Räikkönen had to abandon his Alfa Romeo after less than half the race distance at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.
It was his 349th and final Grand Prix, the "Iceman" ending his career in the motorsport elite.
His wife Minttu and the two children also travelled to the United Arab Emirates to say goodbye.
Räikkönen's greatest success was winning the 2007 World Championship in the Ferrari.
He won 21 Grand Prix races, started from pole 18 times and finished on the podium 103 times. dpa
Friedrich wins 60th World Cup - Nolte wins in two-man bob - Sport
The Norwegian biathlete Ole Einar Björndalen's mark of 94 successes is the goal of the bob pilot.
"I calculated that I would have to win nine and a half races per season, then I could make it to Cortina 2026," said the double Olympic champion from BSC Oberbärenburg, who recorded two victories in two days at the Winterberg races.
It was not until Saturday that he defended the attack of Johannes Lochner by five hundredths, in which he went from third to first place.
Then he changed something in the material setting and on Sunday he drove away with a 0.30-second lead.
With his team Thorsten Margis (SV Halle), Candy Bauer (BSC Oberbärenburg) and Alexander Schüller (SV Halle), he beat the Briton Brad Hall.
Third place went to the Austrian Benjamin Maier.
"We took a bigger risk today and were rewarded," said Friedrich, who also extended his winning streak to 22.
Johannes Lochner, who was driving for Stuttgart, came fifth after previously being second.
Christoph Hafer from the BC Bad Feilnbach landed in eighth place after finishing fourth in the first race.
"If I knew what he did differently, I would do it differently," Lochner said.
Nolte with home victory - podium for Jamanka
On the women's side, Laura Nolte took her third season victory in the two-woman bobsled.
After she only managed fourth place in the monobob on the previous day, she raced to the world cup victory on Sunday with her Schieberin Deborah Levi.
Olympic two-bob champion Mariama Jamanka from the BRC Thüringen came in second with Germany's fastest sprinter, Alexandra Burghardt from Burghausen.
She added the first podium place of this winter to her Olympic qualification.
The Wiesbadener Kim Kalicki landed in third place with Leonie Fiebig.
For me it was supercool, first World Cup podium, I'm superhappy that Mariama is taking me.
I'm super happy with the development.
There is still a lot of potential at the start, but the start times today were okay," said Burghardt and emphasised: "It's not just pushing, but there is a lot to do around it."
Jamanka was a little annoyed by the not-quite-flawless driving, but said: "It's going in the right direction."
I already had the blanket in my shopping cart and could now buy it!!!
What should I do?
I haven't received it yet, so I haven't been able to redeem it, which is why I finally asked.
Last year, due to Corona, I had completely different problems and never had time for it.
And now it says it's expired, which really pisses me off.
Look in the chat, it was about the Asare chair.
I would like to return it and then order again since it's currently on sale :)
Why is the shipping only starting on the 16th of March?
There was nothing about such a long delivery time on your website
No, only when I tip it comes up with an extra field with the message
It was picked up by your colleague yesterday.
Why it's a problem today
I also sent you pictures of the wrong-delivered goods.
But we still want the shelf module, just a new, undamaged one.
And not cancel the whole order.
Only this day, only this week, only until XY...
Hello dear wonderful girls and girls and women,
I have a lot of things I just want to write and maybe one or the other will get it too...
I'm 24, have kPTBS, full-time student, and dog mom - aside from the fact that my dog doesn't bark or go to kindergarten, he's actually 1 to 1 with me.
My boyfriend (6 years together) is sick, has a 2nd degree burn on Monday and has been depressed for years (but is now in therapy).
Yesterday I went to see him because I have emotional needs too and because I want to see and feel him, we hugged a lot and it was nice.
I helped him with the shower (because his hand is bandaged due to burns).
He is also cold and we see each other less (1-2x a week) which makes me struggle with my need for affection and love.
My puppy has just had a stomach ache, I cooked for him and now he's lying in his cuddle blanket and has calmed down a bit after I was there with the heat lamp and petting him.
I live alone with my sister and my mother, and she's away for a month.
Now we also have household chores to do, which we divide up naturally.
But cooking is just so much work for me right now...
My PTBS illness is currently very well managed, I'm somewhat well-treated, and I'm doing okay.
Not good, but I'm fine and almost symptom-free.
My university is demanding a lot (for me), tomorrow at 3 pm I have a written test for which I have not done anything and the day after tomorrow I have an anatomy class for which I should at least prepare a little.
And next week I have an oral exam on Tuesday, and what comes after that is on my calendar and not in my head because there's no more room.
So my week goes: just until tomorrow, then it's the weekend.
But then what happens?
Only until the birthday.
Only until the beginning of the holidays.
Only until the weekend.
Only until...
And so it goes on forever.
I think I'm just stressed out right now that I need these mental cues because otherwise I can't do it.
Somehow I feel guilty and "chaotic," but I can't do it any other way...
Do you feel the same way?
Ehrlich, I'm so grateful that I don't have to work.
I can't really put into words how grateful I am.
I don't know if I would have survived my KPTS otherwise.
I think it has a lot to do with women's mental load, and that's why I thought I'd find kindred spirits here...
I wish you all a restful evening, the week is almost over!
I received my order today, unfortunately the whole other color plus surface is scratched and the table leg has a print.
In the first delivery, the color was exactly as it was on the website.
We are very disappointed!!!!
What can you offer me?
If we switch tables now, I'll get another color or what?
The cancellation email was sent on December 26th.
In fact, twice.
However, it is not confirmed.
On a different note: I noticed in school that many of the religious teachers did not believe in God and it was just another subject like maths or geography for them.
For me, it's always been a little bit strange, maybe because I was raised as a Christian and I've always kind of believed.
How do you feel about that?
Maybe you can tell about work colleagues or study colleagues with different attitudes.
Basically, I understand the difference between private and professional and it makes sense to keep them separate.
It also has a curriculum, etc.
But it would be just as weird to have a physics teacher who doesn't believe in relativity.
Why would you want to teach religion if you don't believe in it?
Preserve culture or what?
Hope your question isn't too personal.
Can it be changed or not? I understand English well
That's been a long time, I wouldn't do it
That's good, thank you.
I expect to hear back from you soon, no later than the beginning of next week.
Thanks for your support #NAME#.
Help with film search
Hello, dear people,
I'm looking for a film from my childhood (I'm 24).
I think it was a film for teenagers.
The film has two timelines (or parallel worlds).
On the one hand, the modern (real world).
On the other hand, the past (or the realm of the dead) (not quite sure).
Since I can't describe it in the real world, there's a young woman.
And in the realm of the dead, a young soldier (uniform similar to those of the soldiers from the Curse of the Caribbean).
For some reason, the paths cross and a plot is created.
The antagonist is also a soldier from the realm of the dead who wants to bring the woman to this realm so that she can live herself, I mean.
I think the transition is also the soldier's grave.
In the end, I believe both soldiers are fighting each other.
If that means anything, I'm grateful for any answer.
Our little one has only been sleeping on her back since week one.
Fast forward: lives still :D
Relax.
Such a child can do more than you think.
Make sure everything is in order around you, no cuddly animals, go in and look more often, but no minutes of surveillance.
That's crazy!
Fresh air in the room.
A good mattress.
No pillows.
Ah, and ours didn't have a sleeping bag, but always had a blanket.
Watch your child when he sleeps.
Does it turn its head to the side?
Can it stand up from its belly?
Or is it face-first into the mattress?
This will tell you if everything is in order.
We've all grown up, and when my husband was born, it was normal to put the kids on their backs to sleep.
In addition, we are already "regular customers" of you and have already bought many articles
But why are you only offering me 20 euros?
Hi, I wrote to a colleague of yours yesterday and haven't heard back yet.
It's about my wardrobe, which arrived yesterday (order number: #ALPHANUMERIC-ID#).
The right drawer doesn't fit in the cabinet.
I would like to contact you as soon as possible.
The cabinet is currently not in use.
To put it simply.
RBTV has promised a lot.
And yes, I know that not everything can be kept.
And I had a lot of fun with RBTV.
But it's just that the station's politics are now under all sorts of scrutiny.
Almost every format is sponsored (ok), but then go on a big begging tour at the same time.
It was said that they were an "independent" internet broadcaster.
Arno quotes: "You don't want to be a running toilet."
What are you now?
An 0815 commercial trying to get his BilloMerch to the elite fan.
And then we have Marah's do's and don'ts.
They apply to everyone, except Simon and Etienne.
They can of course continue to offend people.
A Krogmann who is completely lacking in empathy and is trying to make ash out of the explosively rented rooms at the expense of the action.
How can you find this all acceptable?
Terrible if you like it, I find it horrible.
I request a recall as my delivered wooden table was defective.
A breakdown of the #PRS_ORG# due to damaged delivery.
Whether as a comforter for stomach ache or simply for cuddling - my little heat-loving friend is versatile.
Cherry seed pillows are a traditional home remedy for soothing heat applications, as cherry seeds are very good at absorbing heat and releasing it in a measured way.
The removable inner cushion can be easily warmed in the microwave or in the oven.
The soft touch makes the application particularly pleasant, so that the little ones feel safe even if they are not feeling well.
The cherry seed cushion with cover is only suitable for the following applications:
Before warming the kiss, check for unusual odours, stains or burns and dispose of immediately if present.
Please remove the inner pillow from the cover before warming it up!
In the microwave at max. 300 watts for max. 2 minutes (microwave manufacturer's specifications!)
Immediately after heating, the heat is distributed evenly throughout the bed by shaking!
Then place the inner cushion back in the cover.
During the first heating, there may be a slight moisture build-up on the surface, but this disappears with repeated applications.
Be sure to follow the specified warming instructions, as prolonged periods or higher energy consumption can cause damage (ignition and fire hazard!).
Before heating the kiss in the microwave, check that the manufacturer's instructions allow the heating of grain products.
After the heated inner pillow has been placed back in the cover, please check the temperature of the pillow for babies (max. 43 °C) on your arm!
Do not use the pillow in the event of acute and chronic inflammatory or feverish diseases, circulatory complaints, fresh haemorrhages, bleeding and open wounds, and in people with reduced sensitivity to pain.
Please consult a doctor before using this product if you have skin, heart, vein, diabetes or tumour diseases, or if you are pregnant.
If seams open and loose kernels fall out, dispose of the product and loose kernels immediately and out of reach of children.
If the product is used on babies under 1 year of age, the child's temperature should be monitored regularly during use to avoid overheating!
All serious incidents related to the product should be reported to the manufacturer and to the competent authority of the country where the user is based.
The cover is removable and washable at 30°C.
Please note the care symbols on the product!
Darmstadt after the Hinserie second - Pauli wins in Düsseldorf
Darmstadt 98 can dream of returning to the Bundesliga.
Meanwhile, Hannover 96 is working its way out of the table basement.
For Ingolstadt, it's not working either under the third coach.
Jubilation in Darmstadt after the late victory in the top game, joy in Hannover over the interim coach Christoph Dabrowski and frustration in Ingolstadt after the unsuccessful start under the new coach Rüdiger Rehm.
Is the battery dead?
Last night my laptop (ThinkPad E480 20KQ and about 3 years old) stopped charging through my power supply.
I bought this about five months ago, so it should still work.
I thought that a power supply alone would be enough to operate.
Uh-oh, the battery is dead and the laptop won't start despite the plugged-in power supply.
So I took out the battery, but nothing happens here either.
Maybe you have ideas?
A new battery has been ordered, but why can't I use the laptop on the network?
Is there anything else that's broken?
Thank you for your help!
I want to deliver the #PRS_ORG# to the room.
How can I book this?
I'm interested in the #PRS_ORG# chair.
But I don't know how high the seat is...
Often on tour and still carrying a lot of gear?
No problem with the Everyday V2 Backpack from Peak Design.
The 20 litre capacity swallows even larger photographic equipment without any problems, which can be safely stored using the padded FlexFold dividers.
And what you need for everyday objects is well organized and separable from the photo equipment thanks to practical access points in the individually configurable interior.
The "update" of the Everyday Line to version 2 (V2) also presents the series in a new look.
The minimalist design has become iconic - with the Everyday Backpack series, Peak Design has developed some highly innovative solutions that reliably protect the interior of the backpack while still allowing quick access to the photo equipment.
This works in two ways: first, conventionally via the lid flap, which can be closed with the MagLatch locking system, a brilliantly thought-out solution for effective protection that has already proven itself in messenger bags.
There is a metal hook with matching anchor bars on the front of the rucksack in the closure flap.
Unlike most backpacks, Peak Design has considered different "fill levels": there are four anchor bars, solidly riveted, into which the hook-and-loop fasteners can be inserted.
If the rucksack is full, you just take the top beam, if it's rather empty, you take the lower one.
The cap and hook are also magnetic.
This way, the rucksack can also be securely closed without the hook getting stuck.
The second option fundamentally distinguishes the Everyday Backpack from other photo backpacks: In addition to the lid flap, there is also a zipper opening on both sides of the backpack.
This eliminates the biggest disadvantage of conventional backpacks with access from the top - you don't have to rummage through the contents!
At the same time, this clever detail greatly increases the everyday usability of the backpack: If you don't just take your photo equipment, but also everyday items or travel luggage.
In the Everyday Backpack, you can configure the interior individually (more on this below) and thus store both items separately and independently of each other - and through the two side openings, you can also access them independently.
You can also pull the rucksack from the right side to get to the camera equipment in the right main compartment, while the everyday items stay safely in the left side of the rucksack and don't get in the way.
Comfortable, easy to adjust carrying straps help with this.
And because the rucksack's outer shell is also made entirely from 100% recycled, waterproof nylon, the contents will stay dry even if you're heading to Scotland in the autumn.
Unfortunately, I am waiting in vain for the email from their support.
#NAME# sent me an email yesterday confirming the appointment
Contact has been made with the transport company to pick up the wrongly delivered table.
So far, I have not received any messages.
I request immediate action.
I'm now writing with the third support employee, and I've never gotten any further than the promise that I'll get a confirmation email.
It is the return of the incorrectly delivered custom #NAME#
When will the cabinet be delivered again?
Keeping him like this is not an option for me...
It works.
Many thanks for the help
Wishing you a good evening
Hello, my order number is #NUMBER#. When will the article be delivered?
The order and payment were made on 12.1.21.
I received a completely different lamp than I ordered
Please call me
If you extend my voucher, then I'll place a larger order, but at least I kept the damaged piece of furniture and didn't send it back.
And that the past year went differently than expected I could not guess and could not resolve it in time.
But the damage I as a customer cannot accept.

Coloma is the city where an unexpected event shaped the history of the West Coast.
In the winter of 1848, a man spotted glowing rocks in the water at the southern fork of the American River.
Although he tried to keep his discovery secret, the news spread quickly and triggered the so-called "California Gold Rush" of 1849.
Thousands came from near and far to make Coloma one of the fastest-growing and most prosperous cities in the state.
Areas were cordoned off, tents were pitched, and saloons and hotels sprang up almost overnight.
Everyone wanted a piece of the country's wealth.
For many, it was "Coloma or Bust" (Coloma or bankruptcy)!
In this game, you're a pioneer looking to make your fortune in the West and make a name for yourself.
You'll be looking for gold, recruiting workers, rounding up horses and building businesses.
You will also have the opportunity to explore the surrounding river valleys and adjacent areas.
You're not alone - the other pioneers seem to have the same idea!
You have to outdo your peers to not go broke with the rest of them.
Coloma is a fast-paced strategy game with many paths to victory.
You choose your actions simultaneously, you have to manage your resources and build a tableau that works more and more for you (so-called "engine building").
The buildings on your tableau allow you to be more efficient, gain additional actions, or bend the rules in your favor.
With these buildings and dynamic bridge tiles, you can develop your own unique style of play.
Coloma played out over a three-year period from 1848 (the year gold was discovered in Coloma), through 1849 (the year of the California Gold Rush) to 1850 (the year California became a state).
A year in Coloma consists of five rounds.
During each round, players secretly and simultaneously choose a location on the game map where they can perform actions.
Then their choices are revealed and they place their pioneers in the appropriate locations.
If a site has the most pioneers, it gets a lock!
This disables half of the site - reducing the number of possible actions there.
Players then take turns performing actions such as gathering resources, moving carts, setting up tents, exploring rivers, building bridges, opening shops, and positioning gunfighters.
When all the actions are completed, the pioneers return.
The auctioneer rotates to a new location at the start of each round, changing the available actions.
This goes on until the auctioneer has moved five times, covering each location once and the year ends.
There is a shootout in which the players must defend Coloma from a gang of angry bandits.
If the players have contributed enough gunfighters and are numerically superior to the bandits, they will receive rewards.
But if they fail, they receive lower rewards or end up in the cemetery.
The game ends after the third shootout, then the final score is made.
The player with the most victory points wins!

"Why children are not tyrants" documentary, ARD Mediathek
CW psychological violence, sexual abuse, power abuse
The ARD documentary has now appeared on my Twitter timeline, and I have watched it.
"Dr. Michael Winterhoff, a child psychiatrist, is a frequent guest on talk shows and gives lectures throughout Europe.
With his book "Why Our Children are Tyrannical" (2008), he sparked a fierce debate on parenting.
Former patients and guardians are now making serious allegations against him.
Please take care of yourselves, the film is hard to watch.
And I am very grateful that many people now think and act differently.
Our parents and other responsible people should never, never, never have power over the child.
Our goal must always be to give the child space for his development and to make the framework for the child as large as it is reasonable and possible in the situation.
Brrr, I'm still shivering.
Holetschek: Countries discuss the abolition of the test requirement for those who have been vaccinated three times
The health ministers of the Länder will decide at their next meeting on a nationwide abolition of the test requirement for triple-vaccinated people.
"We need to get clarity quickly as to whether and when the test requirement for those who have been vaccinated three times can be waived", said Klaus Holetschek (CSU), chairman of the Health Ministers' Conference, to Bild am Sonntag.
The removal of 2G plus for triple-vaccinated people is "not only medically sensible, but also provides an additional incentive for vaccination," said Holetschek.
Federal Health Minister Karl Lauterbach (SPD) has promised to "make a proposal to the Health Ministers' Conference as early as next Tuesday". - AFP
So I want to send the lamp back
How should I go about this?
Hi, I like the #PRS_ORG# chair very much, but I can't see how high the seat is.
Can you help me?
I can't shop anymore on my #PRS_ORG#.
Ups, there was a mistake.
Shopping online through the #PRS_ORG# site on a computer.
I updated my account information.
What could be the reason for this?
What you describe is called *awareness* which is sensory awareness under general anesthesia.
These occur with a frequency of about 1 in 1000.
The most common is hearing sounds/voices, followed by seeing pictures/images, and the least common is feeling pain.
Relevant to this topic: Caesarean sections are operations that are accompanied by an increased rate of awareness, as very deep anesthesia is avoided to protect the child until the navel is cut.
Previous episodes of awareness should be mentioned at the pre-anaesthetic discussion.
Certain anaesthetic procedures, such as total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA), are associated with a slightly increased risk.
**EDIT: Dear all, this comment of mine is correct in describing Awareness, however** u/Nitemarex **did not.
I misread her comment.
But the chair is broken.
Unfortunately, the 20 euros won't help us either.
These are statutory warranty claims.
The absolute minimum would be for them to take back the defective chair.
This is in addition to the legal obligation and is standard in the area of e-commerce.
Please check again to see if you can at least return the defective chair.
We then sell the second chair privately.
We're also losing a lot of money.
I have already sent you an e-mail that you have not answered.
Again the question.
The order and invoice state that the goods will be delivered to a room of my choice.
The courier is company #NAME#.
I just called there.
They told me they only deliver to the front door - because of #PRS_ORG#.
Is that so?
If so, I'll have to cancel the order because I don't know anyone who can carry the heavy furniture up to the first floor.
Am I not going to be called?
I had asked a question
Theater historian Günther Rühle died at the age of 97
He has made a name for himself as a theatre critic and as an artistic director.
Later, he wrote a monumental theatre history.
On Friday, Günther Rühle, aged 97, died.
There's still the new book on the table, freshly printed: "An old man gets older."
The shocking diary of a slow farewell to the world, kept by the theater historian and journalist Günther Rühle until April 2021.
And in the middle of reading, the news comes that the author has died.
The last sentence in the book reads: "I am here to testify to my life's worth."
There are different types of pallets.
One of the most common are European pallets, standardized wooden pallets that are primarily used as load carriers in the European area.
They are certified by the European Pallet Association EPAL
According to data from Statistics Austria, more than 10 million pallets were produced in Austria in 2020.
The production value was around 79 million euros.
How many pallets are imported into Austria each year is not collected
New York wins first MLS championship
New York City FC has won the Major League Soccer title for the first time.
After a 1-1 draw in the regular season against the hosts Portland Timbers, the Eastern Conference team decided the final in the penalty shootout with 4:2.
In the Eastern Conference finals, New York defeated Philadelphia Union, the team of German Kai Wagner.
Rouladen tips & tricks
I had many great tips last week for the perfect goulash.
That was what we had for Christmas and it was unbelievably delicious and buttery!
So thanks again :)
Now I've got the taste for it, and I want to cook rouladen for the first time on New Year's Eve.
Tomorrow I'll start a cattle fund.
Do you have any other tips for me?
Note: I don't have an oven, but only a large pot.
What's next?
What happened to the books or how do I get them back on my #PRS_ORG#?
My English isn't as good as it used to be, but I'm getting there
The amount in question is €#NUMBER#.
I was already informed by e-mail on 18 January that the refund had been made.
But to this day, the money has not been paid to me.
Please check that.
Where there is still Christmas roast in the Lübeck area
For many people, goose or duck are as much a part of Christmas as the Christmas tree and presents.
Have you not yet bought any poultry?
Now time is running out.
We will tell you where you can still get a Christmas roast in Lübeck.
The "drive" of a tube output stage contributes significantly to the heat and fat content of the guitar amplifier sound.
These features are perfectly implemented in the Valve Reactor circuit.
With the VOLUME, GAIN and MASTER VOLUME controls, you can set the desired level and the distortion of your sounds.
In addition, the VT+ series amplifiers offer a unique POWER LEVEL control that can be used to reduce the volume without changing the "gain" or distortion.
Further up, it was already clear that the POWER LEVEL regulator can also be used to create a power reserve in the event of excessive noise.
Thanks to the POWER LEVEL regulator, the full potential of the VT+ series can be used in any situation.
The headphone jack can also be used as a line output.
The signal here is processed with a box simulation, so that you get an eminently "acoustic" sound impression even when using headphones or direct recordings.
An AUX port can be connected to a CD or MP3 player so you can jam to your favorite tunes.
A tuner function is also on board - you don't need a separate voice recorder.
If you also purchase the VFS5 foot pedal, you can easily call up the sounds by foot, turn the effect blocks on and off, and "tap" the tempo of the compatible effects.
For the live operation, this is actually indispensable.
With its new power packages, VOX is taking another step into the future!
But that's how I've seen it with other people.
If you can send the lamp back, can you do that?
Because it's too low for a dining table?
So I would like to send them back.
Can you help me with that?
And the dresser?
Will we get another update on the exact delivery date in the next few weeks?
Hello, have they already sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs?
If it doesn't work out, I'd be happy with a legacy or a voucher.
I might find a buyer for the furniture.
Over 1,000 euros for goods I don't need is a bit much.
I just received my delivery and would like to know if screws were included as part of the delivery.
I would like to mount the #PRS_ORG# Spiegel (mirror) on the designated hook.
That's not a satisfactory answer and the wait hasn't paid off
Do you have a premium customer status?
Iran sees progress in nuclear talks
According to Iranian reports, progress is being made in the negotiations to revive the international nuclear agreement.
"Both sides are close to reaching an agreement on the issues that should be on the agenda," Iran's chief negotiator Ali Bagheri told the IRNA news agency on Sunday.
This is a "positive and important development," he said, because at first there was not even agreement on the issues to be negotiated.
The agreement is meant to prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons.
On Thursday, Vienna talks to revive the agreement were resumed after a one-week break.
Negotiators from Iran, Germany, the United Kingdom, China, France and Russia are taking part in the talks.
A US delegation is also present in Vienna, but only indirectly involved in the negotiations.
Thuringia overtakes Saxony - Free State now federal state with highest corona incidence
Thuringia has replaced Saxony and currently has the highest incidence rate in Germany.
It is the only federal state to have a value above 1000.
Thuringia was the only federal state to exceed the 1,000 mark in the coronavirus incidence on Sunday.
The Robert Koch Institute reported a seven-day value of 1,025 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants.
In Saxony, which has always shown the highest incidence rate in Germany, this figure was 990.5 on Sunday.
On Friday and Saturday, the incidence in Thuringia was slightly lower, but was still above the value of 1000.
In Thuringia, 2242 new infections with the Sars-CoV-2 virus and 16 additional deaths were reported within one day.
On Sunday, 200 seriously ill COVID-19 patients were treated in intensive care units in hospitals.
On weekends, there can be delays in reporting.
In addition, the health authorities have been overwhelmed for weeks and are hardly able to catch up with new cases.
I understand that.
Since the delivery won't take place until the beginning of March, it might be possible by then.
I have to print it out and stick it on the package and take it to the post office, is that it?
Here I don't have to click/specify/fill in anything else?
I want to avoid that, which is why I'm writing to you.
I would like to take care of the return at my own expense.
The 8 euro return fee is an insult to me.
It's time for change
###The Bundestag has greeted me, I am u/StratorDE in the plenary hall in the heart of Europe on a fantastic day!
What is the point of the post here?
If you look at the activity of the Bundestag in recent months, you can see that it is not existing.
We've been in a winter slump and have widened the summer hole for a few months.
What's the problem?
Yes, what was it about?
For the most part, it seems to be related to dissatisfaction with how some things have gone and how we generally present ourselves.
In the last few days, it has become increasingly apparent that many here are still very keen on the Bundestag.
#What we need to change
At this point, the community around the Bundestag is asked who wants to keep it alive.
The impetus came from u/edizVEVO, who has become aware of this project in the last few days and has found a pile of rubble, to put it simply.
After some back-and-forth, several people from the community have found themselves eager to rebuild the project.
However, I would also like to call on everyone again to participate, so that this project can continue to exist in the future.
We have created a discussion platform in the form of a Discord server, where we can exchange ideas and work out concrete things.
You can join the server through this link.
Objectives:
* How should the Bundestag work in the future?
* What existing regulations need to be changed/amended/removed?
* How should we act in the future on the outside?
* How will new members be recruited?
* How do we create a fair election system?
I'm pretty sure I've forgotten something, but that's okay, we'll end up with Discord.
If you have the time and the inclination, come to Discord, work with us, and let's democratically decide the future.
I have ordered a lampshade from you that is still to be delivered.
Now I see that the article is too big/clumsy for my taste.
For that, I have already ordered a different suspension from you.
I put it together and noticed this when I took the soft foam.
Very sad about that.
I hope this is returned and I get a full refund.
This is also quite sad, as #NAME# is much darker than expected.
I have one question: the daily cover #PRS_ORG#, is it also available in oversize, i.e. 240/240 for example?
#PRS_ORG# must guarantee that the faulty shelf will be picked up as soon as possible.
And I ask you to make that happen now.
I don't have a suitable packaging, but I will disassemble the cabinet as much as possible for collection - they have to clarify with #PRS_ORG# how this can be done.
#PRS_ORG# can be reached by phone at any time to arrange a pick-up.
Is there a manual for assembly?
How long would it have taken me to get them or to decide whether to return them?
How do they answer the question why they are vegan?
Today I had a conversation with a colleague I like.
She herself has been a vegetarian for a while, and currently eats meat only very rarely.
I was a vegetarian for a few years before that.
When asked if I have always wanted to be vegan and vegetarian a planned intermediate step, I answered honestly without much thought.
And that I had long thought that being a vegetarian would support animal welfare, but eventually reflected and understood that I was ultimately supporting animal cruelty.
That's why I've decided to go vegan.
At that moment I had the impression that she was resentful, and then she defended vegetarianism, saying that she knew where her meat came from and that being a vegetarian reduced animal suffering.
Now I wonder if my answer to "plump" was correct?
How do they answer the question?
I feel like as a vegan, I'm quickly put in a corner and conflicts arise without me having to pick a side.
It greets a harmony-loving vegan (;
It is not an exception under § 312d BGB.
Your #PRS_ORG# does not exempt you from the legal requirements for distance selling.
I am not available on the date assigned by #PRS_ORG# to pick up my returns in person.
Since I can't be there for a funeral, I can't change that either.
Can I please be given an alternative collection date?
From 01.02.#NUMBER# I will be available continuously again.
Lahnsteiner fire brigade ready for water rescue: 45,000 euro subsidy from the state
Recently, the Rhineland-Palatinate Minister of the Interior, Roger Lewentz, presented the Lahnstein Mayor, Peter Labonte, with a grant of 45,000 euros for the new water rescue vehicle for the volunteer fire brigade in Lahnstein.
The total cost of the vehicle, which has been in service since November 2020, was €135,000.
A good and important investment in security.
I am delighted that the state of Rhineland-Palatinate is supporting us in this," says Lahnstein's Mayor Peter Labonte.
The equipment car is used by the diving team Lahnstein, one of a total of seven units in Rhineland-Palatinate.
Above and below water, they perform tasks in water and ice rescue and technical assistance.
In Lahnstein, they are permanently expecting an increase in activity: The boom in the hotel shipping on the Rhine and Mosel as well as the further increasing use of the Lahn as a recreational waterway contribute to this.
I bought a book that I could only read 10% of and then the problems started.
I can't open the book.
However, I followed her recommendations and synchronized, removed and reloaded the app NOTHING has worked.
I'm a little frustrated because the whole operation has already cost me a lot of time and I'm hoping for help now.
Okay, then.
I would like to order 3 items from the #PRS_ORG# collection for June.
Can I enter a date during the ordering process?

Thank you for putting yourself out there for this, I have also spent almost a decade in the civil service in a similar role, so we were also weapons carriers in the executive, I won't go into that any further!
The question of right and left has always been presented to me in a very simplistic way.
Basically, however, one should say that of course the civil servant comes more from the liberal to conservative spectrum and not from the revolutionary left, which should be clear to everyone.
That of course also in the special uniform and weapons carrier should also be clear to everyone that these people then of course with the lived reality can be difficult to deal with is of course also clear, because you have of course besides the average white, now many Germans with a migrant background, women and also homosexuals (and by this I do not mean the exaggerated feminine clichés, because these are in the executive rather less to none but quite normal men and women to whom you do not notice if they do not tell you) and also on these people can rely and I have to rely, because in doubt they save your life or set this up for you.
But even these fringe groups, although it sounds strange at first, in my experience, have a conservative attitude, i.e. they are proud of Germany and feel that over-the-top left-wing politics do not take them seriously, even though these politicians supposedly stand up for them or think it is their duty to do so, but they just want to be treated normally.
Back to the right, since of course the police and the armed forces are also a cross-section of society, you will also find the extreme right there, but that they can openly express their opinion there or even openly plot state-threatening plans in the media is completely exaggerated and annoys me too.
Of course, it happens that police officers and soldiers, who often have been deployed abroad, start to generalize and say things that are controversial or even politically incorrect due to negative experiences.
It also happens that certain right-wing sympathizers meet and have a lively exchange of ideas.
Nevertheless, I think this kind of thing is well fought and also counteracted by political education and enlightenment!
Germany is so very international and that's a good thing in my opinion that we can't afford to have real racists and Nazis in our ranks!
Yes, I don't understand what the other basket is, I also ordered it on the German side.
Why would this come from England?
When I ordered, it wasn't sold out.
I ordered in November.
However, it was confirmed to me in your confirmation of the order
It's still about my order, which is no longer available.
I've been chatting with #NAME#.
Alternatively, you could get the other #PRS_ORG# basket for #NUMBER# Euros in black delivered to Germany or is this basket available in Germany as well.
I always think of you as a partner company.
But at the top of the edge of the timber there are two deep cuts that have been filled with something yellow
And on the mirror itself, there is a small scratch
Ordinary by child?
Hello, I've been dealing with a problem for a long time.
I'm very disciplined and organized at work (I'm self-employed, with little free time), but I've struggled to keep my household clean and tidy for as long as I can remember.
There are always phases where everything falls apart, and then and now I pack up and clean.
But it's really never the case that someone could just drop in.
Unfortunately, my husband is also not better, it bothers me somewhere but mostly the household simply loses against work and laziness.
The kitchen is cleaned most regularly because we like to cook.
Now to my question, have you managed to get your child to be more orderly?
We don't have one yet, but we're working on it and this question has been bothering me for a while.
Because for me, I have no incentive to do it, it just doesn't bother me so much as long as no one comes and there are always fresh clothes and the kitchen is usable.
Does having a kid give you more motivation, or does it leave you slacking?
I look forward to hearing from you.
Exclusive, new, and high-quality, anatomically preformed cut, offers maximum comfort, a perfect fit and so allows almost unrestricted freedom of movement.
Pre-moulding with special further shaping at the joints for improved freedom of movement (arm and knee bends)
The Focea Comfort 4 has more than doubled the area covered by the Flex System in the Flex System 2 in order to further increase comfort.
Seamless stretch panels at the joints reduce friction (shoulder, arm and knee bends)
High-quality preforms in the lower back and in the step ensure a snug, perfect fit.
The 8.8 Stretch Panel in the lumbar vertebrae increases flexibility around the back zipper and improves comfort, especially when bending and mounting and attaching equipment to the surface.
The Free Flex Zone, which is located around the shoulders and back, guarantees increased flexibility in the movements of the arms and back.
Fireskin is a warm, water-repellent material with a special surface structure that provides a high degree of cold protection.
Placed on the chest, it delivers heat to a sensitive area of the body.
Seamless, thin (-2 mm) face seal increases comfort, sealing and durability (separate head hood)
A soft, collar-like zone improves sealing with a fine-adjustable width adjustment by a flexible, non-adhesive, non-restricting tape that doesn't adhere to the casing or seams

Innermanchet edges are notched for increased flexibility
The original Beuchat system was designed to hold the computer in place, especially during deeper dives (the system is compatible with all common wrist-mounted computers)
Career in social work - as someone with an insecure personality disorder?
I did an apprenticeship in the field of software development and have been working as a software developer for about a year now.
Unfortunately, I am realizing more and more that this profession is not the right one for me, which is why I have been thinking about starting afresh and studying social work for some time now.
The problem: I have an insecure (or avoidant) personality disorder (IPD).
This means, in a nutshell, that I have no self-esteem and am therefore shy.
I have no problem talking to people on a factual level, but it's very hard for me to have casual conversations and I've been told many times that I come across as unapproachable (which I think has improved).
Can I become a social worker?
I don't want to work as a street worker or in an open youth centre, but rather in, for example, addiction counselling or family support.
But I don't know if the actual day-to-day work is really like I imagine it to be, and it's hard to find anything online about it.
The EPS is already causing problems for me in my job (for me, emotionally) because every time there's a problem with my code (e.g. "the simplest things are messed up again") it's hard for me to ask more experienced colleagues for help ("I should really know how to do this myself by now" / "I keep him from working with my stupid questions" / "he must really think I'm less well-off" etc.).
I will probably have problems with this in every job but I wanted to mention it at the time.
But have you already got the sofa back?
There was no confirmation for that either.
I'm waiting for a pick-up appointment
What do they mean by return please!
If I download a book from the #PRS_ORG#, it says your #PRS_ORG# does not authorize this book
Are there problems?
I was chatting with #PRS_ORG# who asked if I had a delivery receipt for my locker.
The protein (amino acids) taken in with the food is broken down by the bird in its digestive tract into the individual protein building blocks (amino acids) and from these it builds up its own body proteins, which it also needs for the formation of feathers.
The feather formation in the nestling and the feather renewal in the moulting bird are extremely complex processes and are highly demanding on the overall organism of the animal.
Please note that NEKTON-Bio may not be administered during breeding, as this may cause disruptions in the breeding cycle.
Following this, the daily vitamin supply with NEKTON-S (multivitamin preparation) and NEKTON-MSA (mineral supplement) should be resumed.

1 g NEKTON Bio in 250 ml water or 100 g soft food.
It is only necessary to prepare as much drinking water/soft food as the bird consumes on a daily basis and to change the water/food daily.
A scraped measuring spoon (lying down) is equivalent to 1 g of NEKTON Bio.
In the event of severe feather damage, the double or triple dose of NEKTON-Bio can be given initially, until the onset of feather regrowth is visible.
After this, the normal dose is administered until the plumage has fully grown back.
Storage: NEKTON-Bio should be stored in a dry place, away from sunlight, between 15°C and 25°C.
Please forgive me, but the chair is being sold as an office chair.
How can an office chair break down after nine months?
The warranty period in Germany is 24 months.
That's really bad service.
Hi, I sent an email on Monday to let you know that my order was damaged and pictures were added.
Did you receive this email?
A statement by a municipal employee in opposition to the ordinance
Hello r/LegaladviceGerman,
I have a problem.
A walnut tree is to be felled on our property.
So a complaint was filed with the municipality.
An employee writes to me that the felling of fruit trees and thus the walnut is not part of the bylaws.
However, the constitution explicitly names the walnut as a tree to be protected.
Can I now rely on the testimony of the employee?
On the one hand, I have to rely on an expert opinion.
On the other hand, the statutes are clear.
Thank you for your answers
We understand that.
Then we'll use the new packaging for it.
I haven't received a message
Well, then I still have a sofo that I'm not using.
Could you offer me a bequest or a voucher?
What was more expensive?
Yes, I think so, but the question is, can I pay in euros and have the blanket delivered to Germany?
Can you check that?
Urgent report: Serious traffic accident in Selb
Recently, a serious traffic accident occurred on the St 2179 between the junction of Selb-Nord and Plößberg.
According to the police press release (14:03), a car has been involved in an accident while overtaking in the opposite direction.
There are injuries.
Ah okay, I understand.
Well, then, thank you again for making it so easy!
Advice and ideas for further professional life
Merry Christmas to you!
My Christmas is unfortunately mediocre, because my dear head is currently processing everything that can be processed.
Before I go here now ... in short: I need advice, and best of all from people who know something about my situation - that is, you.
I'm doing the refereeing as a part-timer.
Originally, I studied something else and worked in a field (to at least remain somewhat anonymous, I will not name anything more specific here).
But then I got bored with it all and started looking for alternatives that would be more fun.
At some point I landed in the teaching profession and was sure that this was it - even though the framework conditions are much more inflexible than in my previous profession, but that didn't bother me.
I'm now at the third "I'm Googling other job listings" point.
And it's only been a half a year.
When I was painting before, I always decided to go on and at least finish the ref, after that I can still turn around.
But I'm absolutely done.
I've had so little free time in the last month that I'm completely exhausted.
Now it's a holiday, but there's still a lot of work waiting for me.
Before the rehearsal I always thought I was stress-resistant, but my weekend was my weekend and my evening was my evening.
I had a free day.
And the stress at work was irrelevant in those moments.
Now, even the family celebration is too much stress for me.
And then there are these rigid structures that annoy me even more.
Basically, it's fun and from the outside, the ref is doing well, which is the feedback and so on.
But I'm completely exhausted and wonder how much stress my body can take before it shuts down - if it hasn't already.
I wonder if I want to spend the rest of my working life like this - especially as I read some of your posts here - or if I should go back to the old area where I was valued, where I could take time off when I needed it, and the work was kind of boring, but I was paid fairly for it, and we worked together as a team and not as a lone fighter, as is the case now most of the time.
But then I wonder if in a year's time I'll be back at the same place I am now and dissatisfied.
You realize it's all a bit confusing, but maybe you have some advice or ideas as an outsider, like me, on how to get out of this situation where I'm completely exhausted and start crying at the slightest thought of it.
I'm not going to make decisions emotionally right now, and that probably won't lead to anything good.
But maybe your views will help me to see at least a little light at the end of the tunnel - or to be able to enjoy Christmas, that's enough for me for now.
Thank you for reading and I apologize for the weepy tone.
I hope my situation is at least a little clearer.
Since its introduction in 2001, the Valvetronix series of VOX has continued to evolve, resulting in the combination of advanced modelling technology with the "Valve Reactor" circuit, which perfectly emulates the behaviour of a tube amplifier.
With the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X amps, we're introducing a brand new modeling engine that is absolutely state-of-the-art when it comes to sound.
Thanks to the VET technology (Virtual Element Technology), which is based on the analysis of the components and amp circuits, the VTX amplifiers have an authenticity that is absolutely impressive.
These amps also contain the multi-stage Valvetronix preamplifier.
This is partly based on real analog circuits, because these just get the sound variations and nuances of a tube amplifier better than any simulation.
In addition to this sophisticated circuit, the VTX amplifiers offer a closed housing and a bass reflex system, from which the natural resonances just bubble forth.
With the VOX Tone Room software, you can even correct and distort historical facts on a virtual level until the amp and effects sound just like you've always imagined.
The perfect combination of tube sound with modelling technology is primarily due to the 2001 introduction of the VOX Valve Reactor technology.
Of course, it has been refined several times since then to meet new sound requirements, which in 2010 once again led to a performance boost for the VOX Valvetronix series - with more dynamics and numerous and significantly improved amplifier models.
The new VT+ Valvetronix series, with the handy VT20+ to the VT120+ with two speakers, has also been designed in such a way that all guitarists in search of maximum sound variety will find what they are looking for here.
All guitarists dream of the pressure and dynamics of a tube amplifier: they expect a fat sound, a nuanced reproduction of playing dynamics and string attack, and a quick response.
During a detailed analysis, the VOX engineers discovered that the final stage in particular determines the tube character of a preamplifier and developed the VOX Valve Reactor technology based on this finding.
The valve reactor circuit of each VT+ amplifier, fitted with a 12AX7 tube, perfectly emulates the subtle nuances and character of a tube amplifier.
NBA: Despite 20 points from Wagner, Magic lose to Clippers
The Orlando Magic's losing streak in the NBA continues.
The Wagner brothers can shine - but it's not enough to beat the Los Angeles Clippers.
Despite 20 points from Franz Wagner and seven points from his older brother Moritz, the Magic lost to the Los Angeles Clippers 104-106 on Saturday.
The main compartment is also adjustable: with three individually placable and foldable Velcro parts, it adapts to the needs of your photographic equipment and is therefore suitable for all types of cameras - from mirrorless system cameras of all sizes to full-frame reflex cameras.
What actually fits in the backpack depends on the size of the camera and the lenses.
A possible option would be a DSLR camera with a fixed lens, two to three interchangeable lenses and a flash.
Larger DSLM cameras like the various models of the Sony a7 series or a Fuji X-T2 still have room for more lenses.
In addition, there is plenty of room for accessories.
And if you have a small DSLM camera (Olympus MFT cameras, Fujifilm X-A or E-series) you can use the backpack for your equipment and for non-photography things.
Drone pilots will also find the Everyday Backpack 20L a good choice, as the backpack offers enough space for a DJI Mavic Pro with remote control and accessories.
Volcanic eruption on La Palma: the longest in history
In the three months since the eruption began, the lava flows have caused major damage on the island of Tenerife.
Is an end in sight?
The eruption, which has now lasted for 85 days, is the longest in the known history of the Spanish Canary Island of La Palma.
Until now, the eruption of the Tehuya volcano in 1585 was considered the longest on the Atlantic island off the west coast of Africa, lasting 84 days.
There are no reliable data on previous outbreaks.
The activity of the unnamed volcano in the Cumbre Vieja has decreased in recent days, but volcanologists are still unable to predict when it will end.
The indicators point to a slowdown.
The best news is that they are stable," said the president of the island council, Mariano Hernández Zapata, to the state TV channel RTVE.
Damage in millions
In the nearly three months since the eruption began, the more than 1,000-degree-hot lava has destroyed more than 2,900 homes and other buildings, RTVE reported.
About 1,200 hectares were covered by a meter-thick lava flow.
That's almost 1700 football fields.
More than 7,000 residents had to be evacuated, and the damage is estimated to be more than 900 million euros.
On the coast, cooled lava created two new islands with a combined area of about 50 hectares.
The banana industry, which is extremely important for the island, was particularly badly affected, as about half of the approximately 85,000 inhabitants directly or indirectly depend on it, and it was already in a crisis before the volcanic eruption.
225 hectares of banana plantations were destroyed, and further areas were severely affected, the newspaper El País reported.
Christmas and gifts
Christmas is just around the corner and especially the children will be looking forward to the heavenly feast.
The many colourful gifts under the Christmas tree, combined with the spiritual atmosphere and the crackling tension, have a seductive quality.
Christmas is one of the few traditional occasions that our increasingly divided society still manages to hold together.
It is therefore all the more important to become aware of the Christmas tradition of giving, so that the act of giving, which according to the French sociologist and ethnologist Marcel Mauss was a peace-promoting "social contract of natural peoples", can escape the rigid routine and be revived in the context of this tradition.
How St. Nicholas became the Christ Child
Strictly speaking, it was the Protestants who linked Christmas with gift-giving.
Previously, gifts were exchanged on St. Nicholas Day in one way or another.
The background to this still popular custom is that Saint Nicholas, as bishop of Myra, secretly threw gold into the windows of three women in one night to spare them another life of sin.
This unconventional way of giving gifts gave rise to the popular German custom of filling children's boots with gifts.
Protestants objected to this custom because they reject mediators between God and people as "sacred veneration."
For these reasons, they guard themselves against the institution.
Martin Luther made St. Nicholas into the Christ Child and thus established a new tradition.
The focus of the gift-giving shifted to Christmas Eve.
However, since most Protestants no longer see such details so closely, only a few resent the fact that the custom of St. Nicholas is still an integral part of the pre-Christmas season, just like the custom of St. Martin with St. Martin's songs and St. Martin's procession.
Today, you can find everything that the heart desires in boots outside the door and under the Christmas tree, from socks to coveted luxury watches.
Diversity of traditions in Christian countries
Sources attest to a tradition of gift-giving on St. Nicholas' Day since the 13th century.
With the Reformation, the day of giving moved to Christmas Eve.
However, in all Christian countries there is a cheerful back-and-forth about who brings the gifts to the children.
In Germany, it depends on the region whether the Christ Child appears on Christmas Eve or Santa Claus, who is basically a kind of Nicholas, who has been given some peculiarities over the years.
This includes his white beard, which has little in common with the rather strict Assyrian beard of the historical figure, his sledge, which is pulled by reindeer, and the preference for the fireplace to gain access to the houses.
In the Netherlands, Saint Nicholas remains the central figure at Christmas.
In Spain, the Three Kings give the gifts, while in Italy it is the witch Befana who is said to have shown them the way to the baby Jesus.
In Scandinavia, sometimes mythical creatures bring gifts, while in Russia, Father Frost brought some renown.
Here, it's not reindeer, but three horses pulling his sleigh as a troika.
In the Czech Republic, the birthplace of the Reformation during the Hussite Wars, the Christ Child is responsible for the delivery of the gifts.

Police shoot suspected bank robber near Royal Palace
A man with a gun was shot dead by police near Kensington Palace in London on Saturday.
Police said callers reported a man with a gun entering a bank and a bookmaker's shop.
The man fled in a vehicle that was later stopped by officers.
Shots were fired and the man was hit.
He was pronounced dead at the scene.
The police did not assume a terrorist background.
Several embassies are located in the area around Kensington Palace.
The palace is the official London residence of Prince William, his wife Catherine and their three children.
Other members of the royal family also live there.
What are they?

The decorative lamp fits harmoniously into every bed, garden area or rock garden.
The light is simply set up and can be anchored in the ground with 2 earth spikes.
Integrated and powerful 0.4 Watt solar module for optimal charging of the built-in battery.
Maximum duration of illumination of 10 hours.
- The robust plastic design is suitable for outdoor use all year round.
In the Hollywood spectacle, it is usually threatening objects from distant galaxies that glow brightly on the inside.
Smart Stone, on the other hand, is completely harmless: The sun alone is responsible for the fact that this solar light is fascinatingly bright – either in white or in colored light (in six different color tones).
The edge-free, amorphous design is deliberately chosen: like a natural large pebble, this modern light object presents itself during the day.
Its organic curves fit into any natural environment - whether on the edge of a terrace, in the lawn or in the rock garden.
He also does well in the vicinity of larger pebbles and stones, where he knows how to assert himself thanks to his size.
You can save a lot of work: As a solar light, "Smart Stone" does not require wiring or batteries.
Set the "torch" in a place that is exposed to the sun during the day.
Two earth spikes are provided to provide a firm base if required.
The matt white plastic shell itself is robust and weatherproof.
Its solar panel hides "Smart Stone" discreetly inside, together with its battery and two LEDs - one for white, the other for coloured light.
The battery is already charging when sunlight hits the house.
When the sun goes down, Smart Stone lights up automatically. You can choose the colour yourself: there are six attractive light colours to choose from, in addition to daylight white.
The switch-off is also automatic, once the battery charge level has fallen to a predetermined minimum or as soon as it becomes bright again.
Once the sun comes out again, the cycle starts all over again the next day.
I've done that many times and it doesn't work.
A pity, I would have liked to have ordered more from you, but if the voucher is not credited to me, then I will not order from you out of principle.
If you have a different opinion, let me know.

The motor control of the LokSound 5 has been improved once again.
A variable-frequency PWM clock of 10kHz to 50kHz ensures super-quiet operation for bell anchor motors - the typical "humming" is a thing of the past.
The load regulation can now also be adjusted to difficult cases with up to 10 CVs.
The unique "Autotune" function allows the decoder to automatically tune to the engine.
The LokSound 5 decoder provides up to 1.5A motor current, enough for older motors.

Pill problem
Hello dear people of the world,
I hope I'm doing this right, it's my first post on Reddit after a year.
My problem: I started taking the pill again about five years ago, mainly because I had such awful period pain and shit PMS before my period.
Now I would like to leave that behind, because I already take enough medication for chronic illnesses that I can't choose.
My main problem, surprisingly not the pain, but my skin.
I went from zero to 100 in my last roughly two-year break, and they were everywhere.
So far, it's been superficial, but it's really hurt me and I haven't felt well.
In the two years of separation, it never really got back to normal.
Maybe someone has some tips on how to avoid it this time.
My cosmetics are already perfume-free and without any odours, but maybe there's something someone can recommend to me.
Unfortunately, the gynaecologist didn't take me seriously, and the dermatologist's still coming.
Many thanks to everyone who has read the book!
Yes, the love of the skin is a wonderful thing.
Had severe neurodermatitis before, then a period of rest, then widespread lichen planus and the acne issue.
I've tried everything in the course of my Crohn's disease, and I've stuck with sugar, milk, and lean meats, because nothing else has worked so well.
It could also be that it's just the worm, but if you want to go around looking for anything else that's going wrong, you might as well not bother.
I had already attended all of her colleague's seminars.
Written and now I have lost the conversation and do not know what was answered to my request.
I have to work all the time and answer the phone, and then all of a sudden it's gone...
What is there to check if the money was there, I would have seen it
Please check my bank details, maybe there was a mistake
But there is one in general in large
because it's available in black and big.

In the name of the people: lay judges make decisions
They sit in the courtroom in their everyday clothes.
But their judgment matters a lot, even if they don't wear robes: Judges determine whether and for how long someone goes behind bars.
Two of them report in conversation with "The Public" about their time at the Bad Kreuznacher Land Court: Sascha Wickert from Boos and Ruth Ertz from Bad Kreuznach are two of the 125 lay judges at the Land Court on John F. Kennedy Street.
Hello, unfortunately I cannot get into the customer account.
Could you please send me the invoice for order #NUMBER# again to the email address above?
Can we dispose of the packaging material?
We don't have the means to store it for that long.
We would use the table as they offered it as if it were our own.
I would have liked to have ordered the same chair in blue in November and received it, but because they are so beautiful, I now have one in gray.
Does the cabinet have to be completely dismantled for pick-up and return?
And when would the pick-up be?
110 kV underground cable will be built in 2022
The approval for the laying of the new high-voltage cable in Tann is legally binding.
The government of Lower Bavaria's plan approval decision clears the way for construction to begin in 2022.
Now the network operator Bayernwerk has announced this.
The approximately seven-kilometre-long underground cable will connect the Tann substation in the north of the municipality and the existing 110-kilovolt line between Simbach and Pfarrkirchen.
The cable is connected to a mast near the village of Edermanning in Reut.
Good morning
My order of 03.01.21 with order number #NUMBER# has only arrived in parts so far.
The blue consignment number #PRS_ORG# with the delivery number #NUMBER# was returned by #PRS_ORG# with the note "Delivery not possible".
All three packages have arrived, so delivery is definitely possible.
Can you tell me what the next step is?
A good start to the week!
You can forget that, I have already explained this several times yesterday!!
It's a glass cabinet and all the sides are broken, so there's glass everywhere and the box is broken
The chest of drawers is in my apartment and #PRS_ORG# refuses to come into the apartment because of the #PRS_ORG# rules
This means that the dresser can't be picked up because no one is allowed in my apartment
Thanks for the message
But why only 20 euros?
The original value of this chair was #NUMBER# EUR
No, it's in all the books, so yes, the request to #PRS_ORG# as it seems to be a general problem
Ref: Lesson planning (EK)
Hello, dear colleagues and colleagues,
I've been in the REF since the summer, and teaching is fun, but I'm having a lot of trouble planning my geography lessons efficiently at the moment.
Unfortunately, my school is not very well equipped technically, so I can only use the blackboard, the school book and an OHP as a medium.
At school, I can only copy for free (which is annoying for geography).
I currently need to plan my hours very long.
For example, we are currently working on the topic of geofactors, and for me, every hour counts.
In principle, the methods are always the same, but on the other hand, I don't want to invest too much time in simple lessons (I need that time for UBs, etc.).
I usually plan from the learning goal (what I want to achieve) and then think about how I can build on that (I usually make a worksheet with texts from books that my school doesn't have).
We have the book Terra and with most of the tasks in the book I am rather dissatisfied.
That is why the worksheets.
Maybe a geography teacher can tell me how to use a book efficiently.
I would really like that.
I would like to return the #PRS_ORG# from the order #NUMBER#
I've actually already decided on a new one at #PRS_ORG# but I'd like to get the return sorted as soon as possible.
The trade is worried about the 2G rule for the Christmas season.
Only those who have been vaccinated or recovered are allowed into most shops.
The trade says it is unnecessary and complains of theft.
He also has a possible solution.
The 2G regulations are damaging the important Christmas trade for the German trade association (HDE) from the point of view of the retail trade.
With non-daily items, there are losses in sales, chief executive of the HDE Stefan Genth criticised.
According to a recent survey by the HDE, more than 70 percent of companies are looking negatively on the rest of the year.
Many had already written off the Christmas business.
"What should have been the positive highlight of the year is now often a bottomless pit," said Genth.
Retailers with 2G access restrictions lost around a third of their pre-crisis sales in the past week.
It only runs well in the retail trade in groceries and online.
The association demanded consequences from the dramatic development.
Shopping with a mask, distance and hygiene concept is a safe affair, said the chief executive.
"2G shopping doesn't help us in the fight against the pandemic," he stressed.
The current regulations scared customers away and required high staffing levels.
He called for the band-aid regulation to be approved nationwide.
After that, each customer would only have to be checked once for 2G (vaccinated or recovered) and would have access to all shops on that day with the receipt of the booklet.
In the retail trade - as already in public transport under the 3G rule (vaccinated, recovered or tested) - random checks should suffice.
The property group Deutsche Euroshop, which specialises in shopping centres, also spoke of a difficult Christmas trade.
The frequencies were last without 2G at around 75 percent of the pre-Corona level, the turnover at around 90 percent.
These figures will now fall in the middle of the so-important Christmas trade," said CEO Wilhelm Wellner of the "Wirtschaftswoche".
Due to the high personnel and administrative costs, efforts are being made to find solutions and obtain approval for the centres.
This includes the so-called wristband solution, whereby "visitors, for example, present their 2G proof at a central point in the centre and then, equipped with a wristband similar to that in a club hotel, can enter all shops without hindrance". dpa
I recently ordered and received the #PRS_ORG#
The Spiegel has a scratch and there is also a flaw on the frame, which has been covered up with a yellow filler.
That looks bad.
I would like to return the mirror and have already packed it back into the package and stuck it back on.
How should I proceed with the return now?
The lamp is designed for dual-balance, based on new, flat SMD LEDs with high power and high colour rendering.
The color temperature and brightness of the lamp are controlled by a modern microprocessor with exceptional capabilities.
In addition to adjusting the brightness, there are two standard color temperatures: daylight and artificial light.
It is also possible to manually set and store the colour temperature in the range of 3100 - 5650K.
Use the current settings in the flash memory.
A special feature of the controller is that it is simple and intuitive to use.
The light source produces a very bright light with soft, high-quality, flicker-free light.
The 120-degree beam angle, which allows you to illuminate large areas at relatively close distances, is excellent.
By the way, it is also useful in reporting situations in small rooms or at short intervals.
They can practically adjust the brightness without changing the color temperature.
It's a great tool to use both on set and in the studio.
The optional DMX512 controller allows the light to be remotely controlled in television studios or when the light is mounted in hard-to-reach places.
On the back of the light is the control panel, consisting of buttons and a light-up display.
The display shows the current brightness setting in percent and the current color temperature in Kelvin.
Furthermore, there is a slot for NP-F batteries (not included in the scope of delivery)
Users can store up to three panel settings for brightness and color temperature.
To set the individual settings on the storage locations, simply press one of the storage keys for a long time and it's done.
The power controller stores the current state of the lamp when switched off, so that when switched on again the familiar situation is restored - Very useful in the studio when, for example, the camera is set to a particular colour temperature.
Working with batteries is one of the greatest strengths of the DL3120 functionality, thanks to the possibility of operating with inexpensive NP-F batteries.
These are often already in the possession of photographers and cameramen (and women) - so you can make use of existing equipment.
The DL3120 can also check whether the batteries have enough power before the set - there is a battery tester built-in - for each of the two battery compartments a value in the two display displays (the left battery on the top display, the right on the bottom display).
In addition, it is of course possible to supply the headlights with power continuously via the supplied power supply.
The construction of the Scheinwerfer is very simple.
They have a 16mm sleeve as a fastener, so you can directly attach it to your photo tripod.
The inclination is reliably set on both sides by means of a detector.
Attention was paid to the fact that the mechanical components are also of extremely high quality and are therefore designed for longevity and hard use.
In addition, a reclining joint is included in the delivery.
What's great is that it also comes with a bag.
This way you can safely transport or store the lamp with all the accessories you might want to buy without any problems.
Too bad I got it as a gift and it's too small :(
"Party we wanted to throw": Frankfurt celebrates after comeback against Leverkusen
What a spectacular reaction from Eintracht Frankfurt.
After 22 minutes, the last-placed Hessen, who had lost twice in a row, were supposedly on their way to the next Bundesliga defeat.
But then the SGE turned around, shot themselves in the foot within an hour and lost 5:2. "It's crazy what the guys have done today," said coach Oliver Glasner on DAZN and spoke of a "general praise to everyone who was there".
At first, it looked like another blow for the now ninth-placed Frankfurters, who are still behind their expectations.
Patrik Schick had put the Leverkusens in the lead with 2:0.
What then happened was also impressive to the SGE trainer.
"How the players then came back and showed a fantastic performance," continued Glasner.
I'm absolutely delighted with the performance we've shown and of course with the result.
Also, defender Christopher Lenz, who was able to stand on the court for the first time since the fourth game day and overcame his muscle injury, emphasized the morale of his team-mates.
"I think our mentality is incredible," said the 27-year-old, and he was pleased with the result in particular for the spectators.
That was the party we were going to throw today.
For the upcoming tasks, however, Glasner wants to keep the focus on himself, but he is also well positioned in terms of the personnel situation.
It's extraordinary that we have all the players fit in December, that all the players are physically in top shape.
It's top-notch work in our medical department, but the players live a very professional life.
Now they want to "move forward step by step and remain modest" and "carry out the tasks until the end of the year at this level".
Next up is a trip to Borussia Mönchengladbach (18.30 p.m., Sky) on Wednesday as part of the English week.
I'll get the email that my package is being returned to me due to an error on my part.
I tried to call #PRS_ORG# and get it rerouted, no luck.
Can it be sent directly to me again or do I have to wait until the money is transferred back and then place the order again?
Unfortunately for me, that would mean that I would not order again because it has already taken a long time.
Have you ever sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs?
Handball women's dampers for quarter-final against Spain
Germany's handball women left the court after the humiliation against Denmark with hanging heads and empty eyes.
At the end of the main round of the World Cup, the DHB selection suffered a heavy defeat at 16:32 (8:13) in front of 800 spectators in Granollers and must now face the host Spain in the quarter-finals.
"We were too afraid and had too much respect for the opponent," national coach Henk Groener concluded.
We have to play differently against Spain.
After the first defeat in the tournament, Germany finished the main round group III with 8:2 points as second behind the Danes (10:0).
It's a shame we couldn't take the flow with us.
That was a bad game we have to put behind us," captain Emily Bölk said.
In the fight to reach the semi-finals, a significant improvement is needed against the 2019 World Cup runner-up on Tuesday, in order to keep the fragile dream of the first medal since 2007 alive.
The best German thrower in the duel with the three-time Olympic champion Denmark was back-field player Alina Grijseels with six goals.
"We weren't there - neither in attack, nor in defence," back-line player Xenia Smits admitted and demanded: "We have to look ahead now."
Not at the same height from front to back
Unlike in the previous five matches, the German team was not on the same level at the start.
Errors and technical errors in the attack and gaps in the defence were responsible for a quick 0:4 deficit after seven minutes.
Only goalkeeper Dinah Eckerle was immediately back to full strength and prevented things from getting worse with some parades.
The first goal was scored by the DHB team after 9:30 minutes, when Grijseels successfully completed a quick counterattack.
However, this was not the initial ignition they had hoped for.
Against the aggressive cover of the Danes, the German women could hardly put themselves in the spotlight - and when they did, they mostly failed to overcome the strong Althea Reinhardt in the gate of the Scandinavian women.
That was how the game ended early at 3:10 after 20 minutes, as back-up player Mia Zschocke also saw red a little later due to a hard foul on her opponent.
But she can also participate again in the quarter-finals.
Only in the final phase of the first half did the DHB selection come into play a little better and at least up to five goals.
The already faint hope of a comeback after the changeover was gone after seven minutes at 9:19.
Again, the Greener-Schützlings sinned in all areas and made it easy for the well-positioned opponent, who is one of the medal contenders in the final round, to do so.
As a result, the German team could no longer rise to a performance improvement and left the parkett as a clear loser.
DACH Advent Calendar Day 6: Family Traditions in the Christmas Season
As part of the Reddit Advent Calendar, we have celebrated St. Nicholas Day and used it as an opportunity to reflect on family traditions during the pre-Christmas season, Advent, St. Nicholas, Christmas Eve, and Christmas Day.
How was it at home back then?
Like your partner?
Do you want to pass on your traditions to your children?
What is best for the children?
The boot cleaning?
Baking cookies?
Decorations?
Will music be played?
Is Santa Claus, the Christ Child, or is the gift from Oma and Opa?
No matter how you do it, everyone gives it their all around Christmas to make it as nice as possible as a family.
Whether these are established traditions or even something different every year, tell us how it went or is going in your family!
Please send me any transaction numbers or anything else that might help
Confirmation of transfer... etc
I would like to give out a voucher code

Can they do that?
The title says that I work as a vaccination doctor in mobile vaccination teams, in which (so far only) the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine is mainly administered in nursing homes.
Since these are soon to be completed to a large extent, I will then go to vaccination centres for part of the work.
I am happy to answer questions without a time limit on the organisational and human aspects, as well as medical questions, as long as they do not relate to me personally (e.g. "I take medication X, is this compatible with the vaccination...").
In my area of responsibility, I am responsible for the vaccination, the indication (the person is entitled to a vaccination under the Corona Vaccination Ordinance and has no reasons against it), the medical documentation and, if necessary, the emergency care in case of allergic reactions (it has never happened to me).
The vaccination itself can be delegated to qualified personnel, e.g. medical staff.
In vaccination teams, we often do not have any, but "only" (for God's sake, no lack of appreciation!) pharmaceutical technicians for the preparation of vaccines, who, however, cannot carry out vaccinations (they are not allowed to?), so I carry out most of the vaccinations myself.
Heavy "Huidler" question: Amberger knows the answer
What is a "Huidlerer"?
With this dialect word, sent by an Amberger, the BR television show "We in Bavaria" has caused a lot of heated debate.
However, unlike many previous days, the term "Host mi?" did not escape the callers this time.
No, it wasn't "someone who was nervous."
And no one, "who has to do things quickly."
That was what the TV presenter heard, and it was completely wrong.
On which the man from Amberg communicated the solution and thus probably also caused astonishment among many Oberpfalzers.
"The Huidlerer", the audience learned, "is a rag used to wipe out the stove."
Antony Rowley, a dialect researcher from Bayerischer Fernsehen, has been interviewed by the Bavarian television for years as an expert. He confirmed this.
With the note that this is a typical Upper Palatinate term, derived in some way from the more familiar colloquial word "Houdern".
With which a learning gap was closed - perhaps also for many who have already been living in the Amberg area for a long time.
I haven't been able to buy books for two weeks.
After confirmation, there is always the following error message: oops - something went wrong - try again later.
I have restarted the #PRS_ORG# and connected it to the PC, synced and repaired it.
Nothing has helped.
Tire choice for a racing bike - really so safe?
Today, this morning, I was full of the desire to get to work because I wanted to train at least a little bit in preparation for my bicycle tour next week.
Said, done and I rode my racing bike, which I bought yesterday on eBay.
The first 40 km were also really nice - but then what lurks in every city centre (this time: thanks Krefeld!) happened.
Glass splinters on the track.
Zack, loud hissing and my rear tire wouldn't go the rest of the way.
Since I had no real opportunity to get a replacement coat and a replacement hose, I had to turn around and take the first train home in a half-bad mood.
It was also not so bad technically, maybe it's better if I practice the tire change before the bike tour.
But now I'm faced with a question, and I hope you can help me.
Since I have a relatively long journey over several days ahead of me, I would be extremely reluctant to get this problem more often.
Now it was really not bad, since the old tires from the previous owner (a very nice old man, who tore off 120 km until 2 pm on the day I came to pick up the bike!) and who had already described them as suboptimal, because he had ridden with them for many years on a roller.
But when I think that I have to change a tyre after driving 80-90kms, then I'm really in a bad mood :D
Now I was talking to an older man on the platform who asked me why I didn't have the Marathon Plus tyres; they're supposed to be non-flat.
Now the whole thing sounds very tempting.
But are they really so unbreakable?
I have little interest in now spending 40€ on a tyre only to be disappointed in the end.
I also wonder: I think I have 25x622 on my racing bike right now.
They do exist (apparently?) on the Marathon Plus tyres, but the majority are already wider.
Is this a problem?
Or would you advise me in general about other tyres for a racing bike?
The Schwalbe side seems to be my absolute! Laiewissen rather recommend the Durano DD?
Thank you in advance for your help and best wishes!
Car hits tree: driver killed
The 53-year-old was driving on the B57 between Rheinberg and Xanten with his car for an unknown reason against a central island and then ended up on the opposite carriageway, as the police reported.
There was a head-on collision with the vehicle of a 27-year-old.
The 53-year-old's car was then driven into a tree, trapping the man inside.
The 27-year-old and his 23-year-old passenger were seriously injured in the accident and taken to nearby hospitals.

After the release of our new high-end stereo B 100- 6 OHM, it was only a matter of time before our SOLO series would also get some new blood.
SOLO 15 is the new Sprössling and is visually reminiscent of the large prototypes with the B 200 - 6 OHM.
However, in this construction proposal, a suitably designed foot is included to raise the speaker to the correct listening position.
This has no effect on acoustics and can therefore be adjusted to suit the acoustics at home accordingly.
In principle, the SOLO 15 is very well suited for people for whom the maximum volume plays a rather subordinate role, but an exceptionally high sound level is to be achieved.
A 10 cm speaker is simply not capable of producing such large sound pressure levels almost unfiltered.
However, this does not mean that the SOLO 15 sounds weak.
In contrast, it is remarkably mature and impressive for its size.
The SOLO 15 was tuned to a slight sharp pitch.
This is common practice for wideband systems to optimise the rapidly increasing clustering at high frequencies.
The SOLO 15 is exactly aimed at the listening position and convinces with very clear and fine sound.
Slightly turned outwards, the high tones can be reduced, so that the sound image is made warmer.
Thanks to the point sound source, the individual components of a piece of music can be located in the optimal stereo triangle with razor-sharp precision.
The reference-suspect extremely low mechanical losses of the B 100 - 6 OHM provide for enemy dynamics similar to its own.
The SOLO 15 complements our SOLO series, but also expands it in terms of resolution and accuracy.
As with all our kits, it is advisable to think about the final appearance of the speaker at the beginning, so that corresponding changes to the construction can be planned.
If, for example, the housing is to be lined, the speaker must be adjusted accordingly, as the lining adds further material.
After all the boards have been cut (e.g. in the hardware store), a 8 mm hole should first be drilled in the floor board at the corresponding place, so that later the cable can be installed easily.
With the help of a top router, the loudspeaker opening in the front follows, so that the B 100 - 6 OHM can be fitted flush later.
The opening should be provided with a 45° chamfer to make the opening area of the loudspeaker chassis as large as possible on the inside.
The four fastening points of the B 100 - 6 OHM are interrupted in the phase as shown in the picture "Detail Phase".
Then you start with the actual construction of the box and place one of the two side walls on a flat surface in front of you.
The back wall, the lid, the front and the floor are now glued to these.
The three stiffenings should also be used and glued.
The reinforcements themselves can vary in thickness depending on the material used, e.g. if you want to use ready-made boards from the hardware store instead of making them yourself from 16 mm MDF.
In the next step, the second side is attached.
Then follow all the plates of the foot, that is, the two sides, as well as the front.
With a suitable hole saw or Forstner drill, the installation of the openings of the bass reflex tube, as well as the connection clamp on the back wall, is facilitated.
Afterwards, a round file is used to round off all the edges of the actual box.
The top of the footplate can also be rounded off.
After that, the foot plate is firmly glued to the foot of the housing and additionally screwed with long wood screws.
The marking and pre-drilling (2.5 mm drill) of the screw points of the loudspeaker chassis and the connection clamp follows.
After the housing has been cleaned of wood dust (suction/blowing out), the cable is laid.
The easiest way to do this is through the 35 mm bass reflex opening in the back wall.
The entire and uncut cable is pushed through the 8 mm hole in the foot piece by piece until it protrudes about 30 cm from the terminal opening.
In the upper part of the housing, the cable is led to the loudspeaker opening and left to hang loosely there as well.
The frequency selector is then prepared and used.
The construction plan of the frequency switch, as well as the corresponding connection plan, can be found in the following document: Installation instructions Weiche Solo 15.
If the frequency converter is installed and the connection terminal is screwed in, the sealing of the 8 mm cable opening inside the box, which is not yet completely closed, follows.
By using the 35mm bASSREFLEX opening and a little skill, you can drip hot glue onto the opening and seal it.
By opening the B 100 - 6 OHM and using a small lamp, the seal can be checked accordingly.
Now follows the treatment, according to the description.
Then the B 100 - 6 OHM is connected and screwed in with the corresponding screws.
The polarity plays an important role here, so that the plus lead (marked cable) must be soldered to the plus pole of the speaker (greater contact).
Finally, the bass reflex tube is cut to the specified length of 28 mm (total length of the tube) and inserted.
For damping, a mat of the damping material is cut into two parts and spread loosely in the housing.
The opening around the bass reflex channel should be kept clear.
Can I also cancel my order now and have it delivered only in the beginning of June?
> Hello to all,
> Finally, we can announce that we will be hosting OSCAST again this year!
"Unfortunately, for known reasons, we are unable to get more than four people into the studio, which has meant a higher planning effort and explains the short notice of the announcement.
BUT: There will be at least three people involved, so we'll be streaming the 2021 Oscars with at least seven beans and hopefully thousands of you watching!
> We do our best to avoid delays or other problems.
But hey, it's still a pandemic - we're going to do everything we can to make the Oscars as entertaining as possible.
It will start around 0:30.
Get your drinks cold, plan a good meal, and get ready for a long but very interesting night.
