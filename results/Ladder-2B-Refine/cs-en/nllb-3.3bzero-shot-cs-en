The Czech smolaer is on the verge of a big comeback.
Pavel Francouz was called up to the NHL
Czech hockey goalkeeper Pavel Francouz, who has been going through a difficult period in his career in recent months, is returning to the NHL.
The 33-year-old Pilsen native will be on the bench and could soon find himself on the pitch.
The former goalkeeper of Litvínov, Plzeň or Chelyabinsk was injured in the NHL preparation in October last year.
He has been a revolving door since midway through the game with Vegas, and has yet to appear on an NHL rink since.
The incident occurred as the experienced goalkeeper moved from one post to another.
"Pavel Francouz will be out for approximately three to four weeks with a lower-body injury," the Denver team announced in early October.
His return to the NHL lasted longer than two months.
On Sunday morning, U.S. time, he was called from the farm where he had caught four duels and showed his old form.
In the AHL, he took credit for 94.5 percent of the goals.
The former Plzeň hockey player wants to finally make his mark and prove that he belongs in the best league in the world.
In his senior year, he had hip issues and didn't play in a single game in the shortened pandemic season.
In the NHL, "Franc" has played 36 games, and his save percentage is 92.3%.
Charles puts Camille's veil on Christmas card, William and Kate pose in Jordan
Prince William and his wife Kate have chosen a family photograph taken during their trip to Jordan as their Christmas present this year.
Prince Charles also posted a photo of his wife, Camilla, helping him put on a hat at the races.
The BBC reported on its website that it had been informed of the incident.
They send their best wishes to their friends, colleagues and charities they work with.
The photograph was taken somewhere in the desert.
The Duchess of Cambridge is dressed in a long summer dress in khaki, and so is Princess Charlotte.
Prince William, the Duke of Cambridge, is wearing the same shorts and polo shirt as Princes George and Louis.
Who took the photo, William and Kate didn't say, and it's not even clear when it was taken.
Last year, the royal family posed for a Christmas card photo in front of a pile of logs at their country estate in Norfolk.
The image, which will be used as a Christmas wish, was also released by the heir to the throne, Prince Charles, and his wife Camilla.
Photographer Sam Hussein caught them in action at Ascot in June.
Charles, who has a cylinder on his head and a veil on his face, helps Camille put on her colour-coordinated veil.
According to efotbal.cz, Slavia promised Berbatov a million for the title, Tvrdík denied it.
Prague - Criminal investigators in the current corruption case allegedly worked with the fact that the accused former vice-president of the Czech Football Association Roman Berbr was promised a million crowns by the Prague Slavia for the league title in the 2018/19 season.
He informed efotbal.cz that he had access to a part of the police records.
The chairman of the board of the Vršovický club, Jaroslav Tvrdík, stated that the red and whites did not commit any corruption.
The server published a transcript of police wiretaps in which Slavia is mainly mentioned by its former sports director Jan Nezmar, who left the championship club last summer.
According to the report, the former influential functionary of the Red and Whites was in frequent contact with both Berber and the former sports director of the second league Vyšehrad Roman Rogoz, who is also among the accused in the case.
Police reportedly worked with information that Slavia Berbro promised Berbro a financial reward for winning the title.
In 2019, the SK Slavia Praha team won the first league title.
The police authority had knowledge that Roman (Berbr) would receive a million-dollar payment from SK Slavia Prague officials for winning the league, the server quoted from the document.
The next day, according to the police, Berbr met not only with Nezmar, but also with the chairman of the board of Slavia, Tvrdík.
According to the server, the police are still investigating the information.
The claimant denied any corrupt conduct.
Between 2015 and 2017, we actively sought to change the situation in Czech football and offered an alternative to its development.
We have never engaged in illegal conduct, we have not sought to influence the referees in contravention of the rules of fair play, and we have not provided anyone with any financial benefits in this regard," Tvrdík told Seznam Zprávy.
In the recordings, Nezmar does not discriminate against some of the former Slavia players of dark skin and also slanders his former boss, Tvrdík.
The case of alleged match-fixing was triggered last year in mid-October by police raids in several places, including the Prague headquarters of the FAČR.
The highest-ranking official in the affair is Berbr, who is no longer involved in any of the football functions.
In mid-January, just like the former sports director of Vyšehrad, Rogoz was released from custody.
Helicopters, tanks and bvp are cold war larping.
They will be new, but in essence worse (gunners must leave the armoured cabin and carry ammunition by hand without cover).
The cars - Toyota HiLux - are new and good
The armoured vehicles and various armoured vehicles - at a decent level, moreover, they managed to get rid of the Praga V3S even from the specialised units.
Aircraft: combat- serviceable but at the end of the lease, transport - too small with a short range, but modern.
Drones - few and only small types with no combat potential
Rockets - we have none (but we manufacture and export)
PVO: medium - undergraduate, obsolete; short-range - good, modern, relatively good number.
I have a story like that.
I'm right next to town.
There were nutria in the river and they were doing damage to the crops, so I was sitting there.
When I arrived, I saw that there was a fisherman on the other side of the river.
I didn't want to make a scene, so I just sat quietly and he didn't notice me.
I hoped he would leave before something happened, but of course, the fox came out a little later.
I let her come within 40 yards before I decided to shoot.
The poor fisherman almost fell over, he was waving his head all over the place, so I called him a fox.
When I left the property, he was gone.
In other words, a man can be a pruser even in a meadow.
On the other hand, it's not a war, it would have to be a combination of a lot of coincidences for something to happen, you'd probably be seen in the thermal camera that almost everyone has these days.
So, in plain sight, put your valuables in your sleeping bag and you should be fine.
Vojtech versus Hamáček.
The Ministry of Health has bought respirators at a much lower price than the Ministry of Health
The state responsible for the purchase and distribution of face masks, respirators and other protective equipment for the professions closest to the coronavirus has spent millions of crowns on their purchase in recent weeks.
iRozhlas compared the purchases of individual ministries and found that during a single day, the amounts for respirators varied by hundreds of crowns.
Why did prices move so dramatically?
Which agencies have been frugal?
And why did others buy the rail?
Lenka Kabrhel spoke with the editor of the iRozhlas server, Dominika Kubištová.
I respect the soldiers and the army (I am not affected by memories of the Czechoslovak Army, which older generations have gone through), but the Czech Republic cannot benefit from compulsory military service.
We don't even have a lot of the equipment that would be available to a trained person, we don't really have modern technology for our current professionals, and modern technology is getting more and more complex, so the skills of the back-up people are rapidly being lost in time.
Modern conventional conflicts, where anyone can deploy them, will happen very quickly, and there will be no time to retrain anyone.
And finally, reserve forces/territorial defence are of great importance to countries like Ukraine, where mass gerilla warfare is being conducted and it is a matter of necessity to eliminate the enemy.
The fight will only be possible in a conflict of such scope and intensity, where the guerrillas will be irrelevant, and we do not have the right geography.
We don't have individual skills.
That's not even the worst part.
The worst part is that half of them play like they have it.
Then you're in a situation where you're watching a guy who missed an empty net two minutes ago go into an attack by himself between two or even three Swiss and you're like, "What do you think is going to happen now?"
Of course, they will take him as an average tax payer.
The situation with this tackle is so bad that I'm genuinely surprised to see our forward outwit one of the other team's players.
The first swallows
The Covid pandemic is slowing, but experts are not expecting any major changes in the coming weeks.
Hospital admissions are predicted to continue to rise for some time, and the pandemic equation has, as we know, added a new unknown: the Omicron variant, which is very likely to spread faster than the current dominant Delta.
At the same time, it is not yet possible to say with absolute certainty whether it can cause a more serious course, how much it is helped by vaccination or post-infectious immunity acquired from a previous course of the disease.
But this week, the Covid equation also saw an unexpected phenomenon on the plus side: the possibility of treatment.
A new drug, molnupiravir, has arrived in the Czech Republic, which reduces the risk of severe disease and hospitalisation by a third and can be treated at home.
And soon it will be joined by Pfizer's paxlovid, which has reported a success rate of 85 percent so far.
The first deliveries of molnupiravir to the Czech Republic, however, beyond the hope of expanding the portfolio of tools useful in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic, also highlighted the question of how the Czech administration is prepared for the arrival of the drugs.
As noted, the first to reach domestic patients is molnupiravir from Merck.
The company ended up on the tape first because the drug had been developed long before the current pandemic broke out, with the aim of finding a suitable treatment for viral equine diseases in South America.
This research is often overlooked that people in the West (Germany, Sweden, etc.)
They are generally less open and less willing to share their views.
On the other hand, Eastern Europeans, and especially we Czechs, are used to talking about "how our beaks grew."
You do a survey where you ask people if they like Muslims.
Most Czechs would say no.
In the West, they tell you how much they love migration, how everyone should help them and how we Czechs are racist assholes.
And then they go and vote for parties like AfD.
They're afraid of cancel culture, saying this in public means job loss and media lynching.
Then it looks good in polls, west good, east bad.
But they will find out what people think.
Only in France, Le Pen and Zemmour, both with more than 20%, according to the poll.
We even know that the objects are three and completely identical in Czech.
Identical because of the rotation of the units, so the soldiers don't have to relearn where everything is, so all the objects are the same.
One is the Atom Museum in Brdy and the other two are abandoned.
The funny thing is that the USSR didn't want to have nuclear warheads on its own territory, either for safety reasons or because of the speed of deployment of the warheads due to its more westerly position.
In those underground shelters (there are two in each tree) only the warheads were stored, not the entire rocket as they say.
If the weapon was needed, a special unit would be called in to pick it up and mount it on some kind of carrier.
In addition, the rest of the trees are in a deplorable state.
In the second grade of elementary school, we had a classmate, Cigán, who was with us for four years.
He was pretty good, made some good jokes, often got a bit carried away, but he was our mascot.
He was talked to by everyone, he came around a lot, he wanted to explain things, he didn't miss much, he went to the gym with us, he didn't steal food, he didn't steal phones, he kept his clothes clean.
He went to school in the woods, did a lot of monkey business, but was all right, never got into trouble.
In the eighth or ninth grade, the siblings, the gypsies, entered the same class, different classes.
Soon afterwards, the teacher was beaten up, and the police were called in to deal with it, and they threatened and harassed other students.
I personally sell things from time to time (old things, things I don't need, etc.) and I've sold to the Gypsies many times, they always had money, they didn't try to pull me up on the price, the communication was quiet.
I even sold a car like this, a guy called a month later saying he'd already written it off.
I myself say that I am not a racist, it doesn't matter if someone is white, black, yellow, blue or any other, as long as they behave as they should in a decent society (works, functions, women don't beat, just normal behavior).
But if someone comes, he stretches out his hand, empties apartments and houses, has a mess around him, makes problems... then it doesn't matter what colour he is, but it will bother me.
I have no problem with African migrants as long as they get involved, start businesses, work, learn the language (not necessarily, at least English), and respect our culture.
If you believe in Allah, it doesn't matter to me as long as you respect my traditions and culture, I will respect yours.
Young woman died in car accident in Prachatice
"The young woman suffered serious multiple injuries and unfortunately died at the scene despite resuscitation efforts," South Bohemian paramedics spokeswoman Zuzana Fajtlová told Pravda.
The accident was probably caused by the driver who took the girl.
The 18-year-old driver of a Peugeot car was probably driving in the direction of the village of Žíchovec to the village of Bavorov and for unknown reasons turned into the opposite direction in a bend.
After the collision with the Skoda Octavia, the Peugeot ended up on the roof of the road, police spokeswoman Štěpánka Schwarzová described the accident.
The young driver of the Peugeot suffered very serious injuries in the accident.
He suffered multiple injuries and was trapped in the vehicle.
After being released, he was given acute pre-hospital care and was airlifted to a hospital in České Budějovice in a stable condition, rescue worker Fajtlová stated.
She added that the man in the second car suffered minor injuries to his chest and was taken to hospital.
New rules apply to parcels from countries outside the EU, customers often fail to provide details
Lukáš Neuheisl orders from abroad several times a month.
He mainly collects cards.
"Usually it's tens of dollars, say from ten dollars up, where it's still worth importing, especially from Japan, where the post is often free," the collector explains.
Since October, ordering small consignments has become slightly more expensive, and now he has to add VAT and submit data for customs clearance.
He received an e-mail saying that customs were expecting the package.
Then you just need to fill in the details of the consignor, and if the trader did not include VAT at the time of sale, the customs authority will deduct the VAT from the total amount for the consignment and the transport.
If the consignee does not arrange customs clearance himself, he must also add the carrier's remuneration to the total amount.
According to Lukas Neuheisl, however, the whole process is not complicated.
I click one or two check boxes, insert two attachments, and I'm done.
For me, it's usually a five-minute affair, says Neuheisl.
However, not all shipments are delivered smoothly.
Due to new customs regulations, the daily number of international letters received at the Prague post office dropped from 60,000 to 15,000.
In addition, according to Česká pošta, the problem is also that people do not respond to requests to provide the data needed to complete the customs procedure.
Currently, there are 30,000 parcels in international mail that we have to process.
If people filled in all the information that is required and filled it in on time, we would be about halfway there, says Matyáš Vitík, a spokesman for the Czech Post.
Inflation solution
See the headline, how would you propose a solution to the current inflation?
Currently, we are at 9.9% inflation, and it is expected to continue to rise.
What would you say the state should do to slow or offset this growth?
We see, for example, in Poland the reduction of VAT on food and PHM, is this the way for you?
What do you think is going to happen that's inevitable with where this is going?
Prices are rising faster than wages, and I think it's inevitable that people won't be able to afford basic things, like energy.
How much did you get added (who was the employee)?
This year, I've added 2% gross, which is a joke, but fortunately, I have a similar income from a business I run as an employee.
Could someone explain to me why convicted rapists are sent to jail for just six months?
I just can't get my head around how a court can sentence an animal to six months in jail just so it can do it all over again as soon as it gets out.
Six months is nothing compared to the trauma his/her victim will have for years to come, negatively affecting his/her sexual relationships and relationships in general.
And that's not to mention the fact that the victim of the rape may never recover from it.
Will this dissuade potential future rape victims from coming forward?
The man from the grave "burned" his girlfriend from Kostomlat
The man from the Graveyard inadvertently helped the officers to track down his wanted girlfriend from Kostomlat, who had been issued a warrant for her arrest.
He himself called her.
But he went ahead anyway.
First, he approached a passerby and concocted a story that he had been robbed.
Officers responded to the call and were surprised to learn that the alleged "robber" told them he made it all up to get officers to the scene.
In fact, he only wanted to ask how to report to the Czech Police.
Officers then checked the man's identity and discovered that the woman was on a national wanted list and a warrant had been issued for her arrest.
The case is being handled by the PČR.
An honest question for people here, do you consider our country to be Slavic?
Personally, I think that the Slavs are no longer ethnically or culturally, but I would like to hear your opinion.
Otherwise, of course, I agree with the meme - it's a pity that Churchill failed to secure the liberation of Prague USA :')
Of course, I do not deny that we have a Slavic language.
I don't know, it's a bit of a question whether a rational person can actually believe something without evidence just because it could potentially benefit them.
I would not personally consider such a case to be a true faith.
I can't agree with Pascal on this, but there are probably around 10,000 different religions in the world, if I'm not mistaken.
Which god or gods should one then choose?
I would say it's quite likely that at least one of the thousands of religions has a god who will punish you if you believe in a different god.
But even in the 10th verse, it says that there is no other god but Jehovah.
So wouldn't it be more rational to refrain from believing in any god than to risk picking the wrong one out of a thousand, and the one true god I just missed, to send me to hell or some such place?
Others: Voluntary training followed by being assigned to the reserves.
The Swiss model is similar.
X months of training (in different specializations, X months for one specialization) and under the supervision of professionals with practical experience.
If you do well, you can get a pro offer.
Something like this would suit all the components of the ACR.
It could be done in cooperation with the Defense University.
We can say this: The education sector and industry are constantly competing with each other, companies are hunting in schools, and there is a kind of merging, where the workforce migrates from educational institutions to employment.
Not just in adolescence, but this process is ongoing, we are constantly learning new things, moving from one field to another, etc.
A similar melding should work between the civilian and military sectors.
I see it as a way to build a relationship between the citizen and the military, an institution that guarantees that no Russian, German or Mongol invader will ever come here again.
It's funny how you think of NATO as something that's carved in stone, we have allies and they'll defend us if we get attacked.
Well, I'm sorry to disappoint you.
One election in the United States that turns their budget and NATO goes into a tailspin.
The Brits will trade us for Russian rubles, the Germans will trade us for Russian gas, and the Poles have already shown that all they need to do is turn their backs and take what they want.
The only thing that has worked as a guarantor of independence for a long time is an army armed to the teeth and a population that knows how to use the military technology of its time.
And today, any teenager can pilot a remote-controlled device, so what?
We don't need border fencing, it's a bit of a joke these days, but a cheeky teenager with a remote-controlled device can handle it.
How to avoid drowning in a box tsunami
You unwrap your gifts under the Christmas tree and suddenly you're home with boxes and stuffing?
This "waste" is again being used by e-shops, which lack packaging materials.
That's why we've created a map of shops that accept your used boxes.
And not just at Christmas.
All packaging materials are designed to withstand repeated handling.
That's why it's a shame to treat them like single-use items.
Anyone can bring cardboard boxes, plastic or paper fillings to the participating stores (the KAMsNIM.cz project map contains nearly 150 of them).
This will support small businesses, reduce the amount of waste created and also avoid the overfilled blue bins.
The shops themselves are welcoming the packaging, which is currently in short supply on the market, and also the saved money, as the carton board has increased in price by 50% in recent times.
In addition, this strengthens my brand in the eyes of environmentally conscious customers.
One such store is TIERRA VERDE, a producer of eco-cosmetics and eco-drugs.
Boxes and filling materials are delivered to us in Popůvek near Brno by individuals who collect them at home, but we also hear from companies with whom we have arranged regular deliveries of discarded cartons.
We will use all of this to pack our e-shop's deliveries.
Individually and collectively, we're creating a more sustainable world.
Our wish is to preserve the resources and beauty of nature for future generations, says Petra Lopušníková from Tierry.
However, the www.KAMsNIM.cz application does not only show collection points for packaging material.
It's a search engine if you need to get rid of anything (where to take sorted household waste, where to return expired medicines, tyres, worn-out electronics, batteries, light sources, bulky waste, etc.).
All the waste can end up in the right place, and the reusable items will find their second home.
The map of the project already contains more than 100,000 such places.
"Slowly, collection yards, re-use centres, textile containers, food banks, charity shops, SWAPs and other places that help to find a use for things that would otherwise become waste are being added," says Miroslav Kubásek, one of the app's authors from the association Ukliďme Česko.
I think it's a shame that in this day and age technology is so simple and idiot-proof that children who use a computer or a phone play games on it, but they don't learn the basic computer skills.
Recently there has been a problem (mainly in English articles) that university students don't understand the principle of folders on a computer.
Because, for example, Google Photos or Apple's photo app or even mobile phones in general just hide the underlying filesystem with folders and everything is shoved onto one screen in the app.
It's fine to use techniques from childhood, but it's more important that they learn something.
Let's rewrite history, seriously
Emmanuel Macron presented the priorities of the French presidency of the EU - starting in January - and it was a big deal.
Macron spoke for over an hour, during which he unveiled the logo of the presidency, called for the protection of Europeans – at work and on the street – and mentioned so many actions that they cannot be completed in six months.
But the French politicians like it and so do the voters.
Macron's supporters on the left and the right agree on one thing: Europe.
And in France, there will be new presidential elections in April.
The election calendar also affected priorities.
The French leader mentioned that historians should write "one history of Europe" and France is ready to provide the conditions for such a history to be written by historians.
Several commentators have already criticized Macron for pro-European propaganda and rewriting history.
In fact, they're trying to prevent history from being rewritten.
The far-right candidate for the French presidency, Éric Zemmour, is currently touring France with the claim that the Vichy regime, which collaborated with Hitler during World War II, was not so bad and has a lot of success with the French.
Let's take Macron's idea of a history textbook seriously and not look at what's happening in France.
Wouldn't that be necessary?
Students in European countries learn history as a story of us versus them and never as a story of the whole.
The Spaniards, the French, the Czechs learn who defeated whom in which battle.
But if they don't have a well-informed cantor, they won't know the broader context of the event.
The film of the year is Quo vadis, Aida?
The Czech "Mice" did not win.
The story, which returns to the 1995 Srebrenica massacre, also won awards for director Jasna Duričić and best actress Jasna Duričić.
At this year's Karlovy Vary festival, he held first place in the audience rankings.
The best actor in Berlin was Anthony Hopkins for the film Father.
I'm not very young, I'm not very healthy/fit and I'm not vaccinated.
It was kind of like "having the flu/being sick" for a couple of days I didn't really want to smoke...
Compared to the common flu, it was worse.
I don't have diarrhea with the flu.
(Only my personal experience. I'm not saying everyone is like this.)

Trains start running according to the new timetable, somewhere there is a change of operator
From Sunday, trains will start running according to the new timetable.
The biggest change is the change of operators on some routes, for example between Ústí nad Labem and Kolín, where instead of České dráhy, RegioJet started running.
For most lines, only the departure time and, in some cases, the route will be changed.
There will also be dozens of new trains on the tracks.
The transport companies started selling the tickets during the autumn.
The Czech Railways plan to run an average of 6,783 passenger trains per day in the new timetable, of which an average of 4,780 will be long-distance trains.
Trains will travel approximately 118 million kilometres during the new timetable.
The new timetable will also include routes to Germany, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Austria and Switzerland.
The company will introduce dozens of new trains as part of the new timetable.
The main novelty will be the InterJet trains, which will run on the Prague-Cheb lines.
The carrier will also introduce new trains in northern Moravia and western Bohemia.
The transport company will also increase fares from next year by an average of 3.2 percent.
Railways take inflation into account in their tariffs every year.
The biggest change in the RegioJet timetable is the introduction of the R23 Ústí nad Labem – Mělník – Nymburk – Kolín line.
The operator will replace České dráhy after success in the competition of the Ministry of Transport.
RegioJet will run 16 services per day, eight in each direction.
Other changes concern long-distance services between Prague and Brno, which will also stop at Havlíčkův Brod, Žďár nad Sázavou and Kolín stations from Sunday.
Leo Express kept its 16 connections, two return connections to Slovakia and also a weekend connection to Krakow.
According to the spokesman Emil Sedlářík, the carrier tried to maintain as similar as possible the running times of its long-distance trains, despite the planned shutdowns.
Without major changes, the operation of Arriva trains and other operators should continue.
The operator is also changing on some regional routes.
Passengers will see changes, for example, in Českolipsko, where instead of Czech Railways, Trilex trains of the German company Die Länderbahn will run on the line from Mladá Boleslav to Česká Lípa to Rumburk.
Passengers will also be able to use the same ticket for the second year in a row.
Just like the Czech Railways, their price will increase by 3.2 percent due to inflation.
I disagree.
Are we learning anything from the other side?
Everywhere we hear how much they had to fight for their rights, how they were oppressed and had to act, how they died.
I've never heard a lesson from the perspective of the slave party or the time, no one defends it, just condemns it.
No one tells you in school that blacks often sold other blacks into slavery and that they were often the worst slave traders.
No one teaches you in school that colonists often bought land from the Indians, and all you hear is how brutally we Europeans slaughtered them, while they slaughtered each other long ago.
I have also spent some time in the United States, in schools both in the north and in the south.
I haven't come across anyone deliberately covering up the facts, but I've heard it before and I think it's a problem, I don't deny it (for example, in Japan, WW2 atrocities are quite taboo).
My point was more that history is not black and white and that we tend to look at it from a modern perspective without understanding.
History doesn't care about feelings, it's just what it is and I think it's a fatal error to judge without looking at the time.
On the other hand, we should learn from this and never do it again.
By the way, speaking of the Southern states, yes, the Confederate flag and the famous slave owners are quite popular there, but on the other hand, they did have some good successes and I found it absurd to dismiss them.
And the North wasn't much better than people idealize it to be these days.
And a lot of people forget that not everyone in the South was a slaveholder, and a lot of things they didn't like.
I would not compare this to the Russians, they deliberately omit some facts, lie and manipulate, and there is no point of view on them (there was even a video on YouTube from a TV channel where someone was beaten up, who started talking about our legionnaires and 1968).
What I found ridiculous about US schools was the rise of Marxism and the idealization of communism, something their country had never experienced.
Overall, I found that at some universities, it was shocking that the students were so radicalized and the schools were so supportive of it.
And when I think that these people will one day be much older, it makes me a little bit sick that this could be the voice of the majority, because it's among the young and it's among the ruling elite.
I think feminism has already achieved what it set out to do, and it's not about the same thing anymore, it's radicalized.
Nowadays, feminists are those who have nothing to do with it and ignore the basic biological fact, as well as other groups such as LGBT, and this leads to radicalisation on both sides, where it often leads to resistance even to quite reasonable things.
The more radical someone is, the more they are heard.
In fact, I have never met anyone who has condemned me for colonialism or slavery.
I guess I met the wrong geography, but it was mutual :D
Not because I don't like it here, but because I think it's completely pointless.
I'm proud of something I couldn't do on my own?
In addition, I consider the concept of nationality as a whole to be superfluous from the point of view of any personal identity.
If there's anything that connects me to people, it's interests, worldviews and shared experiences, not where we were born.
I'm not a believer, but from what I know, I can tell you this: We have two Greek Catholic parishes, one Ukrainian and one Slovak.
The Slovak priest is a really nice guy, his sermons are more about theology than politics, but he always manages to throw in a bit about the coronavirus, that everyone is ashamed of.
Then, of course, there is the Czechoslovak Hussite Church.
Officially, they are Protestants, but in fact they are born from the Catholic modernism and are practically Catholics without a pope.
I know a lot of Catholics who go to services with the Hussites, because theologically it's very similar, but the members tend to be more liberal.
They have a beautiful and historically very valuable functionalist church on Botanická Street.
Otherwise, the church of St. Michael in the Dominican Square belongs to the Dominicans, and every Sunday at 3:00 p.m. they hold mass in Latin, as they did before Vatican II.
The Bethlehem star is in the Czech Republic, the scouts took it from Austria
Břeclav - the flame lit in Bethlehem, where according to Christian tradition, Jesus Christ was born, is in the Czech Republic.
The scouts did not go to Vienna this time due to the coronavirus pandemic, but picked him up from their Austrian colleagues at the border crossing Reintal - Břeclav in the morning.
He was also picked up at the border last year.
The Bethlehem Light is a beautiful Christmas tradition that we participate in every year, and I'm looking forward to it.
It is an honour for me to have been chosen, said Amálie Budíková, a scout, to the journalists present.
Last year, the handover took place at the Mikulov-Drasenhofen border crossing, directly on the border bridge, but this year at the Reintal-Břeclav border crossing in the car park.
But usually, the scouts take him to Vienna by train.
There is no change in the distribution of the fire in the Czech Republic.
The scouts traditionally set off with the Bethlehem light by train first to Brno, where they hand it over to the diocesan bishop Vojtěch Cikrle.
The subsequent distribution of the light will be taken care of by Scout couriers on Saturday, December 18, who will travel by selected express trains and passenger trains.
They will take over the light at the local scout stations or volunteers who will then spread the light throughout the Czech Republic, even where the tracks do not lead.
This year, the scouts must also follow the current measures against the spread of the coronavirus.
It's the same as last year.
We recommend both courier teams and local event organizers to wear masks, try to maintain distance, there should be as few as possible, do not sing colleagues, just behave in a way that is as safe as possible, said the spokesperson of the Bethlehem Light event, Zuzana Hrbková.
The tradition of the Bethlehem Light, which travels through Europe, was born in 1986 in Austria.
The aim is to spread the idea of peace, friendship and harmony at the same time as the flame.
The light of Bethlehem is a symbol of hope, a light that overcomes darkness.
In the Czech Republic, the spread of the disease has been taken care of by scouts and scouts for more than 30 years.
The action is backed by hundreds of volunteers, and the candles are also a symbol of compassion and human kindness.
All the latest news, including a list of places where people can go to light a candle, can be found on the website www.betlemskesvetlo.cz.
I don't have an economics degree, so I don't know the fundamentals of economics that confirm that subsidies are the cancer of the economy, but I don't think the subsidies as a whole would be a problem.
Infrastructure, ecology (e.g. water retention), health and education all use the money well, but I just don't understand why the money is spent on agriculture, industry and firms in general.
As mentioned - it produces an unnecessary product and damages the free market and "natural life of the company."
I work in a factory where there are a million "xy funded/co-funded by project xy" signs in the hallways, and such a company is just artificially kept alive.
This is not supporting a company that gives jobs to x people, this is holding back development when this company holds on and takes orders/employees from companies that could grow and be more productive after its demise
It's a total no-brainer, it's terrifying.
Even a person who was born in the age of the Internet sometimes gets caught up in a trick or a trap - especially advertising.
I think I'm immune to online advertising, but I'm sure I'm not the only one who has been affected - it's just so pervasive that you can't avoid it.
That is why I support the radical voices in the European Parliament who currently want to ban programmatic (= targeted) advertising...
It's all a scam, in the words of the classics - I'd ban the internet.
I feel that this virus has its roots in (but mainly in point 1):
1. "I won't believe anything that the majority believes and it makes sense, I'm not a sheep, but I'd rather believe something that's less likely, it doesn't make sense, but it's important that I have my own original opinion which I'll claim is critical thinking"
2. "I won't believe everything the media says"
3. "I don't trust politicians"
TV has fallen out of the Christmas movie trend, with 200 films premiering this year
Los Angeles - Cinemas, television networks and streaming platforms in the United States and other English-speaking countries have been caught up in the trend of Christmas movies, and this year they will present a record-breaking more than two hundred to their viewers in the premiere.
The operator of the movie database IMDb calculated it.
The Christmas family and romance film genre has been gaining popularity and viewership in recent years, so more and more of these films are being made.
This year, four times as many Christmas movies have been made as in 2011 and twice as many as five years ago.
The IMDb database, however, only includes those movies that have the word Christmas in their titles, so there will actually be more holiday films.
The movies people traditionally associate with Christmas have been around for a long time.
In the Czech Republic, fairy tales are associated with this period, and films such as Alone at Home, Love from Heaven or the classic Christmas story Life is Beautiful from 1946 are also popular worldwide.
The right Christmas movie boom, however, did not start until 2009, when the American cable television network Hallmark launched a special film series.
Her Christmas project, Countdown to Christmas, then included four films and was a huge success.
This year, the station started its viewers on Christmas on October 22 and will present a total of 42 Christmas films.
Lifetime's rival network, Lifetime, has 35 new Christmas-themed movies on its schedule this year, and popular streaming platforms such as Netflix are also contributing to the total.
"In this magical time of the story, it doesn't really matter, what's important is that there are a lot of Christmas trees in the background and it's snowing," said Brandon Gray, author of the book I'll Be Home for Christmas Movies.
"For the audience, it's a form of escape and a way to at least for two hours feel a little bit of calm in the midst of all the holiday madness and the insanity of the world we've been living in the last couple of years," Gray added.
According to him, for example, Hallmark uses the same recipe for its films, which is uniform but successful.
You have two people who fall in love, but then about half an hour before the end there's some misunderstanding, but it's resolved and they fall in love.
It's like this all the time, and as long as all the movies look the same and have the same vibe, people will watch one after another, Gray adds.
Mazepin tested positive for COVID-19 and will not take part in the final race of F1.
Only nineteen drivers will take part in the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix in Formula 1.
Nikita Mazepin tested positive for COVID-19 and will not race in the final race of the season.
Haas will only send one car to the track.
In the last race of the season, he was aiming for a better position from the 20th place he achieved in qualifying.
However, Russian Nikita Mazepin from the Haas team will not enter the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.
He had tested positive for COVID-19.
Only nineteen cars will start the race, with Mazepin's team-mate Mick Schumacher starting from the back of the grid, while Max Verstappen, who will face Lewis Hamilton in a head-to-head battle for the title, will start from first place.
Mazepin is according to Haas's statement relatively well and does not show any symptoms.
Nikita is physically fine as he was asymptomatic.
She is now in isolation and will follow the advice of public health officials, with safety being the ultimate priority for all involved," her representatives told formula1.com.
Haas will not and cannot send a replacement rider to the race.
A substitute would have to qualify or race in another part of the weekend.
The first athlete to not be affected by COVID-19.
Kimi Räikkönen, who is just about to start the season, tested positive for COVID-19 last year, and Sergio Pérez and Lewis Hamilton tested positive for COVID-19 last year.

From the point of view of the law, covid is listed as a contagious disease.
So it's in the same group as HIV, plague, yellow fever or typhus.
§ 152 Spreading of a contagious human disease
(1) A person who intentionally causes or increases the risk of the introduction or spread of a contagious disease in humans shall be punished by imprisonment for a term of six months to three years, a ban on activity or forfeiture of property.
(2) The offender will be punished with imprisonment for two to eight years.
c) breaches an important duty arising out of his employment, profession, position or function or imposed on him by law, or
d) causes serious harm to health.
(3) A person who commits an act referred to in paragraph 1 shall be liable to imprisonment for a term of three to ten years if, by that act, he causes serious injury to health to at least two persons or death.
(4) The offender will be sentenced to imprisonment for a term of five to twelve years if he causes the death of at least two people by an act referred to in paragraph 1.

Gold, silver and 150 diamonds: The price tag of the most expensive suit will blow you away!
It's kind of like a portable jewelry store, and the creator put in half a year of work and all his savings into it.
"I had a vision of what I wanted to create, but little experience, sweaters were never worn much at home," says Liban, who spent 3,000 hours on his project in six months.
The silk was bought in Italy, the 24-carat gold thread in France and the 2000 Swarovski crystals were supplied by the company.
The silver stars were then adorned with 150 diamonds.
"The foundation is wool and cotton, but silk gives it the softness," praises the creator of his work, which, however, he does not recommend washing.
And there's another twist.
"I'm completely broke, I have to sell my sweater as soon as possible," admits Lebanon.
If he succeeds, he will set a world record.
The previous most expensive sweater sold five years ago was for just 720,000 crowns.

Is the Omikron mutation spreading in southern Moravia?
Hygiene is investigating another case of a child from Adam's.
"We are currently investigating another case of this variant in another child from Adam's nursery.
There is no direct contact with previous cases from Adamov," said Ciupek.
Six cases have been reported in the county in the past week.
"We are still awaiting official confirmation of the variant in our six cases - it is being carried out by the National Influenza and Non-influenza Virus Reference Laboratory of the State Institute of Health in Prague," the director said.
She added that they were two nurses from the Brno University Hospital and two children of one of them, as well as two eleven-year-old students from Adamov Secondary School.
There is no connection between the cases in Brno and Adamov.
Three of them have mild symptoms, four are asymptomatic.
No one with suspected Omicron has travelled abroad
None of the individuals have left the country, nor have any of their families, nor have they been in contact with anyone who has been abroad.
There is no connection to the water polo championship for any of the above, Ciupek said.
The chief hygienist, Pavla Svrčinová, previously stated that an international water polo tournament, which was held in Brno a few weeks ago, is being investigated.
Players from South Africa and one Belgian player were also affected.
California is restricting the sale of guns.
He wants to act like Texas when it comes to abortion bans.
California Governor Gavin Newsom announced Saturday plans to ban the sale and manufacture of certain weapons in the nation's most populous state, using a legal mechanism Texas used in its controversial abortion heartbeat law.
People would then be entitled to compensation for suing anyone who manufactures or sells assault rifles or homemade weapons in California.
Newsom's announcement came in response to a Friday ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court that upheld Texas' abortion ban, even though it goes against a nearly 50-year-old precedent that established a right to abortion nationwide by roughly 24 months of pregnancy.
However, the court did not rule on the constitutionality of the entire law, but on a technical issue arising from the innovative design of the measure.
The injunction was therefore transferred to the public, which made it impossible for Texas Republicans to challenge it through the normal judicial process.
"I am outraged by yesterday's (Friday) Supreme Court decision that upheld Texas' ban on most abortions and largely supported the Texas maneuver to protect its law," California governor said.
"If states can now block federal courts from reviewing their laws, then California will use that power to protect lives," Newsom continued.
He allegedly instructed his subordinates to work with the state parliament and the justice minister to draft measures that would allow representatives of the public to enforce the ban on assault weapons and so-called ghost weapons.
They are called "ghost guns" because they don't have serial numbers and can be used to circumvent regulations.
Newsom wants to give "private citizens" the right to sue for at least $10,000 (over 220,000 CZK) in damages and legal fees from anyone who manufactures, distributes or sells assault weapons, "ghost gun" parts, or kits to make them in California.
"If the most effective way to keep these horrible weapons out of our streets is to create a threat of private lawsuits, then we should do it," the California governor said.
The AP notes that California has banned the manufacture and sale of certain military-style weapons for decades, but a federal judge blocked the ban as unconstitutional in June.
If the state were to actually reinstate the ban using the Texas model, it would confirm the words of liberal Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who in a dissenting opinion to Friday's majority ruling warned against expanding the legal mechanism to other states.
The Supreme Court, however, did not grant Texas' abortion ban complete immunity from judicial review and allowed abortion clinics to sue certain officials in the southern U.S. state.
Every emergency vaccine has a public trial phase, where the vaccine regimen is gradually worked out and the vaccines themselves are improved based on the results.
For example, Israel is already conducting a large-scale study on the effects of four doses.
And according to these studies, most patients experience a five-fold increase in antibodies, which has a long-term effect.
It will have its own vaccination schedule eventually, but it's just too early for that.
Another fact is that a new vaccine, based on inactivated virus, which according to the manufacturer's specifications promises to be up to 10 times more effective, should be on the market soon.

Poland threatened to stop payments to the EU budget
According to Ziobra, the European Commission would be acting in contravention of the law if it used its new powers to withhold payments to Poland over the rule of law dispute.
The Commission has postponed approval of Poland's plan to draw EUR 36 billion from the EU Recovery Fund to help economies hit by the COVID-19 pandemic.
And it is under pressure from the European Parliament to go further and use a mechanism to claw back EU subsidies from countries that flout the rule of law.
"Poland should respond to this EU diktat with a veto on all matters requiring unanimity," Ziobro, head of the small Solidarna Polska party, said, without whose votes the current government would have lost a narrow majority in the Sejm.
"Poland should also consider its obligations in the EU energy and climate policy, which leads to a drastic increase in energy prices," added Ziobro.
If the dispute continues, I will demand that Poland stop its contributions to the EU.
It would be justified given that the EU is illegally withholding funds from the common budget, which we also contribute to, the Polish minister added.
His party's approach to the EU is more radical than that of the ruling Law and Justice party.
According to the European Commission, the changes that the Polish judiciary has undergone under Ziobro's leadership threaten its independence and subordinate it to politicians.
According to Ziobro, Brussels is setting "impossible conditions because its goal is not a legal state, but a change of government in Poland."
Warsaw is facing a "political dictatorship carried out by intimidation and an attempt to overturn the democratic decision of several million Poles," Ziobro also said.
He said Poland should be a member of such an EU based on the partnership of sovereign states, not the government of the strongest and the Brussels bureaucracy that is not under democratic control.
He said his party would never accept such concessions from Brussels, which would limit Poland's sovereignty.
"We will never agree to the status of a colony for Poland," he said.
But to identify it... In Lidl, they have one type of cheese in four different places.
I didn't look for anything else, I've come across yogurt more than once, I just needed cheese, Parmigiano Reggiano, after ten minutes at the dairy shelves I gave up and asked.
They had it, it's true, in that narrow sector were all the selected, less common and special cheeses, but it was between the vegetables and the lactose-free zone...
If I'm avoiding, I don't even go to the market anymore, action or not, the gold shop on the square, they don't have such a selection, but they have everything I need and it has some order, so I'm done in ten minutes.
To take a break at Lidl.
And I don't care about that anymore.
I've watched for two years how they treat data like shit, and most of the anti-vaxxers are just a little bit more off the mark than most of the pro-vaxxers.
The rational discussion is taking place at the professional level, but the extreme views are getting into the public sphere.
They are constantly moving from one wall to another.
Binary thinking: Vaccines will save us, vaccines are useless.
To ban everything, to allow everything.
Colorful cakes instead of robust analyses.
Comparing apples to oranges.
That's the way this state is and that's the way we are.
But the data collection methodology is different in those two states, and no one is addressing that.
Fuj, so I'm relieved.
Sorry for the spill and have a nice day to you all.
As a child, they punished me with a pot.
It was never because of my grades, it was mostly because I repeatedly refused to listen and get angry (I read instead of going to bed, I washed myself with a washcloth, etc.).
At the same time, I have never been punished without warning, my mother always first threatened that if I did it again, I would get hit (sometimes even after another "reprimand", she would only bring the stove and put it down so that I could see it).
Only after I repeatedly refused to listen did I get a few blows to my buttocks (through my clothing).
Personally, I think physical discipline (in reasonable amounts and proportion) is beneficial because a child responds much more to physical discipline than to words.
I think the warning part is important because it gives the child a choice of whether or not to listen and get it or get hurt and not get it.
I just needed to be warned to start listening.
Defence of the system
When prominent Czech lawyer and constitutional judge Vojtěch Cepl in 1999 answered a journalist's question about what the Czech constitution means to him – whether it is a sacred document on which he swears and which he has been taught since childhood, or on the contrary, a contract that can be changed at any time – he clearly preferred the first option.
Once we agreed on democratic rules for our lives, which also define who we are as a state and its citizens, and change is better managed.
And imagine: some nations even have rules they like.
Just as Czechs love pork and cabbage dumplings, Vojtěch Cepl asked the question.
However, there is a growing opinion among lawyers that the Czech Republic's Constitution needs to be amended.
The year is tested by situations that its creators (to which Vojtěch Cepl belonged) could not have foreseen, such as the behavior of the directly elected president.
However, Cepl was right on one point.
What we know about these documents shows that political interference in their texts must be deliberate.
The institution must be understood and actively defended, only then can it be the key to overcoming most of the crises that companies face across history.
The constitution is, among other things, a kind of code of conduct for politicians, setting out the rules of the game.
We fear that power will be abused against minorities or individuals, so we are banning politicians.
At the same time, constitutional texts also allow politicians to exercise their power.
Covid doesn't choose, a few-month-old baby is fighting for its life at the FN in Brno
While it is known that the coronavirus is milder for children, there are also severe cases that hospitals are dealing with especially recently.
"We know that children are more vulnerable and affected than adults, we are talking about 2 to 5 percent compared to adults," said Petr Dominik, head of the Pediatric Anesthesiology and Resuscitation Clinic at the University Hospital Brno and the Faculty of Medicine of Masaryk University, to Novinky.
The course is much simpler, lighter, often symptom-free.
But there are children who are seriously ill with the coronavirus, which we have seen particularly in recent times," added Dominik.
According to the doctor, there are dozens of children who need mild supportive care.
It takes place at a pediatric infectious disease clinic.
Very seriously ill children with coronavirus are now being admitted to the ARU for the first time.
Children with post-covid syndromes have been in the ward continuously throughout the year, according to the doctor.
"Now we are seeing an increase in children with acute COVID-19, which means pneumonia that requires a stay in an intensive care unit," he said, adding that the disease affects not only adults but also adolescents and several-month-old babies.
Children are also being admitted to hospitals due to the coronavirus.
"We currently have a child aged several months and an adolescent in our care," the head said.
However, he is pleased that the Children's Hospital in Brno has not yet recorded any child deaths from the coronavirus.
According to available data, six children aged 0 to 14 died in the Czech Republic on 6 December.
According to Dominika, a psychologist is an integral part of the cooperation at the children's hospital, not just in the coronavirus ward.
It also draws attention to the fact that just like in adults, vaccination also reduces the course of the disease in children and at the same time reduces the incidence of post-covid syndrome.
"That is why we recommend the vaccination dose for children as well," the doctor added.
In the quiet zone, you can only walk along marked paths.
But the quiet zones are not that big.
They can be seen on the tourist map on maps.cz.
In general, in national parks outside the quiet zone, you can walk anywhere (but don't climb over the fence into the enclosure).
Skiing/biking in the woods outside marked trails is not allowed anywhere unless you have an exemption (but of course it's not really monitored outside of national parks).

China is building the impression of a well-managed epidemic and that the authoritarian regime is coping better with the crisis
Sinologist Jirouš: China is building the impression that it has mastered the epidemic and that the authoritarian regime is coping better with the crisis.
China has launched a medical and political offensive.
Beijing has been under fire for failing to contain the virus, which has turned into a global pandemic.
Now the country is reporting zero new cases.
Countries including the Czech Republic are competing for Chinese protective equipment, and Chinese doctors are helping to fight the coronavirus in many places, including the hard-hit Italy.
How do you feel about Beijing's willingness?
Is it friendly support or is the communist regime trying to improve its image in the world?
He runs into a friend and says, "Hey, do you want an elephant?"
I have it and it's great.
My wife is happy because she is mowing the lawn, the car is washed by the car wash, the kids play with him.
Well, that's just great.
If you want to buy an elephant for 5000,- I'll sell it to you.
Friend: That's it, I'm going to clap, it's going to be great...
After a while, they meet and the buyer complains: What did you sell for an elephant????
The lawn is flattened, everywhere there are giant holes, the car is crushed, the kids are scared, and the wife wants a divorce.
The guy who sold it says, "You talk bad about elephants, you can't sell an elephant like that."
World affairs are dominated by the great powers.
Although sovereign states are equal, it is the great powers that determine the course of international affairs.
Europe can only become a great power if it works on its integration.
It is currently functioning at the economic and political level (on certain issues), but military integration is still lacking.
Personally, I think Europe is heading towards federalisation.
It won't happen in 10, 15 or 20 years.
But maybe by the middle of the century, the mood will be different and it will work.
I thought of that and it's certainly possible.
I'm not an expert in Czech, so I may have made a mistake.
I just take the fact that an ellipse usually includes 2 different units on the same level.
I'll borrow an example from another comment, "Spanish oranges and mandarins," where it's clear that they're both from Spain, whereas "Spanish fruit and mandarins" is not clear that they're from Spain.
Also, I'm basing this on the fact that the phrase sounds like "all American forces," including their weapons, and I know that American facilities are run by Americans.
In other words, I expect that it is already included in the broad concept and there is no need to specify it for the American forces.
But again, maybe just a wordsmith:D
Either way, it's an unreasonable request

Vicki Holland from the UK tortured the monkey Milly
The distressing footage shows the terrified monkey cowering in a toilet bowl before its callous owner flushed it and spat on it.
Hollanda's monkey was also fed kebabs and hamburgers, regardless of its actual nutritional needs.
A Gwent Magistrates Court has now banned her from keeping animals for life, The Sun reports.
Monkey rehabilitation experts caring for Milly after her abuse have said they have never seen such a scared monkey before.
Milly has spent nearly two years rehabilitating with staff at Monkey World in Dorset and is now happily playing with another rescued monkey called Moon.
The mother of four admitted to two counts of causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal.
She was given a 12-week prison sentence suspended for a year at Newport Magistrates' Court.
Holland was also sentenced to 120 hours of unpaid work, a life-long ban on keeping animals and was ordered to pay CZK 12,000 in court costs.
The leader of the Small Monkeys team that rehabilitated the abused animal, Steph Sawyer, said: "Milly is fine, but the rehabilitation will continue."
Milly took a while to get used to people again.
She would crouch and hide from anyone she met and any loud sound or sudden movement would make her scream.
Opička refused to eat for a long time.
Even now, when she's settled and happy with the male, she can still be triggered by the sight of new people.
The psychological scars of the abuse will haunt her forever, says Sawyer.
The abuse of Millie came to light after police in Gwent found horrific footage on her phone following a raid at her home over drug allegations.
In the footage, Milly is heard swearing.
In the next video, Holland offers the monkey cocaine and says, "Do you want cocaine?"
That's how I lick my fingers.
In May, she and her partner, Russell Cox (43), admitted to possession of cocaine with intent to supply.
At her home, cocaine worth £1,600 (around 50,000 Czech crowns) was found hidden in Kinder eggs.
Cox was subsequently sentenced to 30 months in prison and Holland was given a suspended sentence of 20 months.
And what amazing concepts do you learn from the Palaeolithic three times in a row when you bravely skip over the entire 20th century?
Like, you're gonna take the same things from freshman year that you took from sixth grade?
And it kills the idea of biffing, where no one, with very few exceptions, cares if you can do it or understand it.
Just write the test for 1 and then no one cares.
Go and ask random people on the street if they can figure out the character of the roots of a quadratic equation and the coefficients.
They've all been there, and the vast majority won't even flinch and will tell you they're absolutely fine.
So what is the point of this bitch learning?
I'm a big fan of general knowledge and the fact is that people don't want it and don't need it.
And at that point, it's pointless and you'll never get it into them.
It's partly learned for the many people who will need it.
But like, the note that you don't need to stand in front of the machine for all this stuff, I mean, I was really serious... ...because you don't need it.
Plus, we're slowly getting to the point where not knowing is a hallmark of punk.
(We may also be paying for our communist past and the fact that we have a lot of barbarians working on those machines) But the price of having those barbarians working on those machines is just too high.
If journalists could count, covid probably never would have reached these dimensions.

There has been a rift between Kadri and Andreou since the beginning of the experiment.
The main problem was that Kadri lived and worked in Switzerland and his idea was that Andrea would move out, at least until she returned to the Czech Republic permanently.
But she adamantly refused.
And as you can see, their relationship did not end in love, but rather grew into mutual disrespect and hatred.
It was a premeditated attack on you! Kadri retorted in response to Andreino's accusations of lying, gambling and debt.
Kadri's alleged honesty was no longer liked by his ex-wife and his younger sister Linda.
She decided to publicly defend her brother.
I don't normally talk about things like this, and we've never really talked about it as a family.
I don't want to cause any regret.
But when I see someone trying to publicly hurt and smear the name of someone I love so much, it just breaks my heart.
I'm sorry I have to do this in this way, but I would like to publicly thank my brother Kadri for turning himself into a character and helping our family when we needed it most despite his young age.
I'm more upset when I read such false information, which is probably taken out of context.
I would like everyone to know Kadri as I do, our loved ones and family stand in faith in response to Andrey's words.
I am really grateful to him for everything!
Of course people will believe what is written, but the most important thing is that we, his family, love him above all and know the facts and know how it really was, she added.
The drunken thief climbed up the facade to the fifth floor.
You won't believe why.
Chao began his robbery spree at a parking lot in a residential area, where he tried to break into several cars.
According to available information, he eventually stole from one vehicle the equivalent of just over 330 crowns.
After that, he had no choice but to climb up to the fifth floor and enter the apartment through an open window.
He stole two bananas.
One of the security cameras then caught him walking away from the scene of the crime, eating a banana.
When the owner of the apartment woke up in the morning, he discovered that the bananas were not where they were and called the police.
She was then detained by Cchaa.
The man admitted to drinking alcohol on the day of the crime.
And since he needed the money, he decided to rob.
The whole thing is still under investigation.
The drunk climbed up the facade to the fifth floor, where he stole two bananas.
The pandemic law is time-limited and is tied to the pandemic emergency.
If it is repealed, the law will no longer be in effect.
The law, however, limits the scope of business
That's not enough for you?
The right to assemble will be restricted, but not abolished.
More than 60 percent of voters turned out for Saturday's elections in four municipalities
The new councils were elected in the villages of Komňa in Uherskohradišťsk, Lužice in Mostecko, Nová Ves in Liberec and Rovná in Pelhřimov.
The number of councillors in these towns has fallen below the number stipulated by law or the elected councils have broken up.
A total of 99 candidates were vying for the 28 seats on Saturday.
The average age of the newly elected representatives is 46.7 years.
The oldest is 69, the youngest 33.
The processing of the results of Saturday's elections symbolically closes a rather difficult but successful year for us.
There were four new or repeated elections to municipal councils and, above all, very closely watched elections to the Chamber of Deputies, said vice-president of the ČSÚ Eva Krumpová.
She recalled that due to the COVID-19 epidemic, the elections were more demanding in terms of equipment and personnel security.
In Komni in the Uherskohradišť region, the Association of Independent Candidates won Saturday's election with 27.76 percent of the vote and two seats in the seven-member council.
STAN candidate received 24.84 percent of the votes, which also means two seats.
Two seats in the council were also won by Citizens for Komňu, with 18.52 percent of the vote.
The current mayor of the municipality, Jana Křižková, who is a member of the Association of Private Practitioners, also got into the council for them.
The Komňané achieved one seat in the municipal council – independent candidates.
Turnout was 75.48 percent of eligible voters.
The association Pro Rovna won in the village of Rovná in Pelhřimov.
It received 50.50 percent of the vote, which means four of the seven seats.
Two representatives from the Association of Independent Candidates 1 and one from the Association of Independent Candidates 2 also entered the municipal council.
Turnout was 93.62 percent.
The Lužičtí a Svinčice Association, led by Mayor Jindřich John, won the repeated elections in Lužice on Mostecko once again.
It received 56.73 percent of the vote and, like in 2018, has four seats in the seven-member council.
The second place went to the candidate of the People's Town, who received 43.27 percent of the vote and will thus have three representatives on the council.
Turnout was 76.7 percent.
The election in Nové Město na Moravě in Liberec was won by the independent candidates Naděje pro Novou Ves ahead of the ANO movement.
The Independent Candidates' Alliance received 59.88 percent of the vote and won four seats on the seven-member town council.
ANO received 40.12 percent of the vote and strengthened its position in the 2018 general election, gaining one more seat and having three.
Turnout was 42.9 percent.
The State Election Commission will discuss the results of the election on Monday.
They will then be published in the Collection of Laws.
What do you think is the bigger problem?
A dead civilian or a dead foreign politician?
I think all the things people are writing to you are pretty good.
You're just playing a fool so you have someone to "fight" with.
If not, then it's sad.
I'm not saying that Christians are degenerates, or anything like that.
I even like a lot of church buildings from an aesthetic point of view (which was the point, after all, to look good).
And I don't really care who believes what.
On the other hand, I find it bothersome how much power the church had in the Middle Ages, how much money it made, how it suppressed science, and so on.
Not to mention all the wars she's started, like the Thirty-Year War
Tl;dr: Believe in the spaghetti monster, but the state and the church have nothing to do with each other
The man fell headfirst from 12 metres.
The impact on the concrete survived.
The unbelievable fall survived a man in Ostrava on Sunday night, when rescuers from the regional Emergency Medical Service were called in.
County emergency dispatchers took an hour-long call at 12:01 a.m. Saturday with initial information about a man falling from a height.
Two ZZS crews - medical and paramedic - were immediately dispatched to the scene.
Paramedics arrived at the scene and found the 28-year-old man had fallen from a window at around 12 metres and hit his head on concrete!
Coal was mined in Vítkovice.
But not in the way it should have, and firefighters went to work.
When the rescue teams arrived, the man was unconscious with multiple injuries and in life-threatening condition.
The intervening doctor intubated his respiratory tract, provided artificial lung ventilation, and the ambulance transported him to further care at the Ostrava trauma center, said Lukáš Humpl, a spokesman for the ZZS MS region.
I'm more worried about the public's and authorities' inadequate responses than the coronavirus
The spread of the coronavirus in the Czech Republic is a challenge for politicians and officials, but the front line of the fight against infection is primarily doctors and medical staff.
How serious is the situation from their perspective?
We're talking to military doctor David Rezac.

Legendary Nunes falls after seven years, Oliveira retains belt
MMA had a great night of fights with some interesting results.
Things were happening at UFC 269.
The outsider Julianna Peña was able to defeat the legendary Amanda Nunes, who had not found a challenger in seven years.
Charles Oliveira did not hesitate in the lightweight division, displaying a great submission against Dustin Poirier and retaining his belt.
Kai Kara-France also won, knocking out Cody Garbrandt with a technical knockout in the first round.
He also defeated Sean O'Malley.
A surprise that no one expected.
It was a women's bantamweight match between the legendary Amanda Nunes and Julianna Peña.
The American entered the bout as an imaginary "wimp," as Nunes had not lost in seven years and was grinding her teeth for another victory.
The beginning of the duel was also in the spirit of paper assumptions.
Nunes started the fight very aggressively and even gave her opponent a push kick that sent her to the ground.
But Peña did not allow herself to be pushed into making another mistake and unsuccessfully attempted to attack herself with a baton.
The second round was thrilling and very exciting for MMA fans.
Both women were on the receiving end of a barrage of excellent punches and hard hooks.
Penny also got Nunes on the ground, where she started strangling her.
She had to give up and retreat.
The American woman has given everyone a huge shock by becoming the new champion.
The highlight of the night was the lightweight title fight between Charles Oliveira and Dustin Poirier.
At first, however, it was Poirier who was doing better, but the cards started to turn against him.
In the second, Oliveira tried to be more active, trying to hit his opponent with his hand.
It didn't work out for him, but afterwards he put a lot of pressure on his opponent, got him on his back and hit him with a series of blows.
That's how he won the second round.
In the third round, Oliveira showed a rear naked choke, which Poirier resisted for a while, but then had to break free.
The Brazilian defended his title, while Poirier lost after two years.
In the next fight, Sean O'Malley achieved a supreme triumph by nailing Raulian Paiv in the first round with a hard right back.
He then received a series of precise strikes and recorded his fifteenth victory.
Kara-France then dealt with Cody Garbrandt.
In the spring, Nunes celebrated another victory with her little daughter, who is now seven years old, but lost for the seventh time.
The hip, or the hip?
At first glance, it's not complicated at all.
Most Czech nouns express only one grammatical gender, so it is not difficult to determine whether they are masculine, feminine or neuter.
There is also a fairly large group of nouns for which the gender is not fixed.
Such significant names vary between the two genders.
When they are plural, they take on the double-ended form and in some cases remain in that form.
For example, the words svízel and kyčel are masculine and feminine, in the first they are inflected according to the pattern stroj, in the second according to the pattern píseň.
For another group of nouns, there are different forms already in the first singular number, for example: řádek/řádka, kedluben/kedlubna or brambor/brambora (in the sense of food).
Both forms are standard, have the same meaning, and are therefore freely interchangeable.
Some expressions may vary regionally, for example "okurka" in Bohemia and "okurek" in Moravia, in this case the Moravian variant is ungrammatical, as are other Czech-Moravian pairs of words: "příkop" and "příkopa", "kobliha" and "koblih", etc.
Some words that have entered the Czech language from other languages were originally unpronounceable, but they are gradually acquiring Czech endings.
A typical example is the word "image," which is masculine and feminine, or the word "buffet," which has remained in the middle gender ungendered, but in the masculine has endings following the pattern of "ed."
Turkey has opened the way for migrants to Europe.
What is the situation on the Greek border?
Tension is growing at the Greek-Turkish border as the number of migrants trying to reach Europe grows.
Thousands of people started to cross the southern border of the Schengen area after Ankara stopped blocking them.
European politicians are pledging support for Greece, and the Czech government is also preparing humanitarian aid.
What drives refugees to take such a dangerous journey?
And what is the situation on the ground?
We haven't seen blue skies for three months and we're suffocating, says a Sydney journalist
The bushfires, which have been ravaging the country for four months, have killed nearly 30 people and hundreds of millions of animals, and destroyed millions of hectares of land.
How are the authorities and the residents coping with the aftermath?
Could the Morrison government have done more to avoid the drastic impacts critics say it has caused?
And what will the country have to do to prepare for the future in relation to climate change?
Lenka Kabrhel spoke to Sydney journalist Ika Detrich.
False accusations have always been rare.
That's why it's always written about everywhere.
People are uncomfortable with what sexual violence looks like in our society and how prevalent it is, so they try to cover it up.
I don't personally know anyone who has been falsely accused.
I know a lot of people who have been raped and I've seen how their neighbors or the police often treat them.
Victims should always be believed.
The trend has been that victims are finally opening up about their trauma.
But it's still something that a lot of people keep to themselves.
Yes, there are those who falsely accuse others.
It's disgusting and it's pandering to all the victims of sexual assault, but by spreading the idea that "a lot of the accusations are false" and that it's a "trend" you're only helping the perpetrators.
The Czech Republic is flooded with unfinished houses, families have no money to finish
Building material prices have risen more than 30 percent in recent weeks and months.
A number of people have found themselves in a precarious situation.
She doesn't have the funds to finish the homes that have been built and the banks are refusing to increase her mortgage.
In addition to the cost of materials, the cost of construction work is also increasing.
As a result, people don't have enough money to finish the already built family homes.
In many cases, banks refuse to increase the amount of a mortgage, which creates an extremely unpleasant situation.
At best, people are moving into vacant and unfinished homes.
In the worst case, the houses are uninhabitable and families are forced to sell them because they cannot afford to pay their mortgages and rent," says BHS economist Štěpán Křeček.
We're building two to three family homes a year, and 50 percent of the time we've done it.
As a construction company, it's difficult because we have to stick to certain things in the contract even though the materials have gone up in price.
So we are working for free," said the owner of the construction company Zdeněk Slivoň.
Many people will have financial problems.
If they were counting on the cost of building the house to be five million, now it's going to be seven.
I think some will wait," Slivoň added.
The most expensive items were copper, iron and the plumbing and heating equipment.
But construction firms are also struggling with a shortage of workers.
There are shortages of construction graduates in the Czech Republic, and the influx of foreign workers is being hampered by the pandemic.
The situation regarding the issuance of building permits is currently more favourable.
"Building authorities issued 7,675 building permits in October, which is almost 10 percent more than a year ago," Křeček explained.
We're doing well and we'll do even better.
But the real vision is missing, says the ČRO commentator – myRozhlas
In addition to traditional celebrations, politicians have traditionally used the new year to deliver speeches.
This year, in addition to the Prime Minister and the President of ANO Andrej Babiš, the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies also addressed the nation.
What have we learned?
Like in my case, I have my own topic, I chose it myself, I'm following up on my bachelor's, I'm always working on it for the whole year, and then in a week or two I write the written part.
The State Department is cool with it, unless you're a total moron and something is left in your head, then the committee won't be too interested in the theory.
I learned to be a statesman for a week, and when I was at the end, the commission always tried to lead me to some logical conclusion, which I got right away, and I was right.
Otherwise, there are people who pay someone to do the semester project for them (we've done it many times, it's really beneficial, it teaches a lot) and then they just learn the project and they're done.
I think it's great that at the end of the course there's a test that covers the knowledge gained from the project, not just the defense.
But don't email or call the embassy, and don't send any packages.
You'll be just as bad as they are.
Those people at the embassy have nothing to do with it.
And if they were against Russia, they would have risked a lot, so maybe they have to play with them, because otherwise something could happen to them.
But you can also put a similar statue of Putin next to a statue of Winnie the Pooh.
Třebas would then put it so that it hits Xi Jinping's backside or something.
I agree, even though Insta is throwing artists under the bus.
Once you post stories every day and at least once a day a new picture, your reach will drop to absolute minimum.
Plus, they keep changing what's more important, likes, comments, or saves.
I've been really pissed off lately, so maybe I'll have to go back to TikTok, where a lot of my peers are having success and they're barely allowed to do it.
Ultimately, I would be happy if something more user-friendly came along that didn't suck all the creativity and energy out of artists.
The statement of the Party of Workers in Donbass
The Union - yes, the breakup - no, they express their opinion on the picture against the breakup of the USSR.
Thirty years since the illegal break-up of the USSR.
On December 8, 1991, the greatest geopolitical catastrophe in the history of mankind took place.
On December 8, 1991, Boris Yeltsin, Leonid Kravchuk and Stanislav Shushkevich, without any legal authority and in violation of the results of the referendum of March 17, 1991, with an open smile, signed an agreement that "the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics as a subject of international law and as a geopolitical reality ceases to exist."
One stroke of a pen "erased" a huge country with almost three hundred million people.
Tens of millions of ethnic Russian citizens found themselves abroad after the collapse of the Soviet Union.
Since the early 1990s, Russia's population has fallen by ten to eleven million.
Even without the loss of the population of the former Soviet republics, we have already lost more people than in the two world wars combined!
Earlier, the same people who destroyed what had been built in the Belyozhsky Forest in one sitting in the 1970s, betrayed the socialist camp (created at the cost of millions of lives in World War II and the Great Patriotic War).
They deliberately deindustrialized, slowed down agriculture, severed ties with the world's biggest power with 14 republics that had previously been economically linked through a single mechanism.
If we look deeper, we see the impoverishment of the population, the breakdown of the economy, science, the military, the growth of crime, inter-ethnic conflicts, the war in Chechnya, all the conflicts in the post-Soviet space, the series of orange revolutions, the expansion of NATO to the east, the war and the breakup of Yugoslavia, the Arab Spring, the war in Syria - all this is the result of geopolitical capitulation, the surrender of the socialist camp first, and then the Soviet Union.
There is such a concept in political science as the "vacuum of power."
Everything that was seized and surrendered in a hurry was quickly filled and occupied by NATO countries that accepted our geopolitical capitulation.
And the world is still reeling, mainly due to events of the late 1980s and early 1990s.
The price of a product sold in a large supermarket may not directly correspond to its quality or value.
It's Monday and we have some meat at the supermarket that costs 189 CZK/kg.
I'll buy it and put it in the fridge and make it for dinner on Thursday.
In an alternative reality, where I don't buy meat on Monday, the chain will reduce the price to 99 CZK/kg on Tuesday - explain to me the mechanism by which this meat will become a burden on my digestive system?
Or I'll wait until Thursday and the meat will be 1 day before the sell-by date reduced to 69 CZK/kg - how would this meat differ from the one I bought on Monday for 120 CZK/kg and left in my fridge for 3 days?
I will answer myself - nothing.
Those people who say that if something is cheap, it must be bad, defected or of poor quality are incredibly retarded, to tell you the truth ;-)
I recently went to Hlavas in Brno and the ladies were handing out some leaflets, which I always take with me to help the volunteers, they can't get rid of it...
No, the pamphlet was full of common sense and conservative views on the workings of the world, but nothing about God, and I was confused, but I knew it was going to be some kind of propaganda.
After reading it, I found out who was publishing it and it turned out to be Scientology.
No, because he was a good matroš, full of all sorts of useless tips, like I should wash and not be a pussy.
It's a waste of paper to cut down the forests for this.
I've had something similar with an ex-girlfriend.
Psychological manipulation and emotional blackmail will force you to do what that person wants because you love them and you don't realize how messed up the situation is.
She threatened to hurt me a few times because I went out with a guy she didn't like.
Or when I wanted to leave her apartment earlier, she started crying and begged me not to go.
Then she started physically blocking the door.
For a year it was a great relationship, but then another six months went by and she started to get on my nerves.
Then I ended the relationship with her because I told her that I was breaking up with her and she lied to me but I can talk about it next week to calm her down so she doesn't go crazy.
That kind of person sucks the joy, the emotion, and the overall happiness out of you.
It's better to keep a distance
When insurance companies are frantically buying up test clouds and chasing positives who wouldn't even know about the deadly disease if it weren't for the test.
The only thing we're accomplishing is complicating things for companies, carriers and others because their employees in the random number generator have been grounded for five days.
In the West, they have given up on the charade and admitted that there is no point in trying to deal with a disease that is weaker than the famous flu.
Unfortunately Válek is new and has a lot of growing up to do and a lot of ego stroking to do by making up bullsh*t.
I look back and I see the old good guy coming back.
After years of quiet and suppression of this unethical business, MLM recruiting is back in the spotlight.
I was one of the recruits, I tried it (I was 20, a freshman in college), the initial promises of product training and business skills quickly turned into "you don't have to care, just get people."
I was genuinely interested in the products I was offering because I wanted to help people, but the training was more about how to scare and amuse people.
When the first checks came in, people quickly realized that if they wanted to make money, they had to sell a few products a month.
Investment life insurance and mortgages were the only sources of income, and so one felt like a local salesman.
But what can I say, it was a valuable experience, one learned not to jump on every speck and to check information thoroughly.
I wouldn't put all of them in one bag.
People in this business are successful and even beneficial to people, but they certainly won't be bragging about expensive consumer goods or "fat" accounts.
In the corporate world where I work, I haven't seen much of this.
HR is quiet, managers are minding their own business, and they don't stick their noses in our business.
So the regular evaluation does happen, in the form that it happens here it's quite good (set some goals for next year, next year we'll see what worked and what didn't) - it's more of a self-evaluation than someone evaluating you by some numbers, and so on.
Corporate events are also optional.
But we are also a bit unique within our company - we have departments that are more "corporate".
Sometimes it feels like we're a quasi-startup squatting in the offices of a big corporation.
But it doesn't really bother us until the results are in.
The Czech woman missing in Britain has died.
Her body was found in London.
Nearly a decade later, British police are still searching for a 32-year-old Czech woman who went missing in late November.
On Sunday, December 12, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Jakub Kulhánek, announced on social media that a woman from Uherskohradiště had been found dead.
British police today confirmed to our office in London that they have sadly found the body of the Czech citizen who went missing.
The cause of death is being investigated.
We will not be releasing any further information about the case.
Kulhánek wrote on Twitter that he was deeply saddened.
The young woman was last seen on November 28 on a bus on her way home from work, before she was due to pick up money from an ATM.
Her disappearance was reported by co-workers five days later.
After that, the London police started looking for her, and Interpol listed her as a missing person worldwide.
She was also listed in the Czech Missing Persons database.
The police have already detained one man in connection with this.
What role he played and what he's suspected of, but she didn't name.
In four municipalities, new councils were elected at the end of the year
On Saturday, 11 December, new councils were elected in the towns of Komňa in the Uherskohradišťsk region, Lužice in the Mosteck region, Nová Ves in the Liberec region and Rovná in the Pelhřimov region.
The number of councillors in these towns has fallen below the number stipulated by law or the elected councils have broken up.
In the new elections, 99 valid candidates competed for 28 seats.
Turnout was 62.41%.
The highest turnout was recorded in the village of Rovná, where 93.62% of eligible voters voted.
A total of 8 women and 20 men were elected.
The average age of the elected representatives is 46.7 years.
The oldest is 69, the youngest 33.
A total of 13 candidate lists were registered for the new elections in the four municipalities.
36 women and 63 men applied for the 28 council seats.
The average age of the candidates was 46.6 years.
The youngest candidate was 22, the oldest 72.
The processing of the results of Saturday's elections symbolically closes a rather difficult but successful year for us.
Four new or repeated elections to municipal councils took place, as well as very closely watched elections to the Chamber of Deputies.
We had to work in more demanding epidemic conditions, which placed greater demands on equipment and personnel security, said Eva Krumpová, 1st Vice-President of the Czech Statistical Office.
The last precinct was processed on Sunday, December 12 at 3:49 a.m.
On Monday, the State Election Commission will discuss the results of the vote and once approved, they will be published in the Collection of Laws.
This is the biggest problem I have with the whole pandemic.
It took me a while to get used to the fact that we have a very dangerous contagious disease, but it went without any major problems.
It's a problem I've struggled with for a long time, trying to deal with the idiocy of a large part of the population at all levels.
I'm most looking forward to getting vaccinated (tomorrow!) because of that I'll finally be less dependent on other people not being assholes.
He would be stripped of the presidency and the ability to retake it.
However, the chances of that actually happening are pretty slim.
Moreover, I am not sure if it would qualify as a treasonable act.
Velezrada is such an act by which the President of the Republic endangers the sovereignty, territorial integrity, or the democratic character of the state.
It must have been something more serious.
How the pandemic has affected intimacy: The number of people aged 35 and under who are having sex all year is growing
More and more young adults in the U.S. are living their lives without sex.
They are mainly people of faith, the Daily Mail website says.
The survey showed that from 2008 to 2021, the percentage of people aged 35 and under who gave up sex rose from eight to 21 percent.
Women aged 18 to 35 who said they had not had sex in the past year are more than ever.
Other factors contributing to the decline in the number of sexually active individuals include the IFS survey.
One of them could be the economic impact of the coronavirus and the higher unemployment rate.
But the presence of media, social networks and video games that make sex less and less of a priority for young people may also have contributed.
"Since 2010, the proportion of men and women aged 18 to 35 who say they did not have sex in the previous year has been rising rapidly," said IFS researcher Lyman Stone.
For people in marriage, sexual activity is more common, with only 5% saying they had not had sex in the past year.
Among the single people, it was 29 percent. Stone added that marriage under the age of 35 is only a small percentage.
The decline in sexual activity is also due to the fear of premarital sex and religious affiliation.
While men are more likely to be sexually active, the percentage of married and cohabiting men under 35 is falling.
Young people's attitudes to pre-marital sex are divided, with about 30% saying it's wrong, while about 70% think it's okay.
"It's true that in this age group, there's a minority of singles, but their behavior is moving that trend," Stone said of the 30 percent.
For most of those who have a moral problem with premarital sex, the reason is religious.
Since 2008, the rate of abstinence among single people under 35 who attend religious gatherings more than once a month has increased from 20 percent to almost 60 percent.
The trend has risen from 10 percent to 20 percent among the "less religious," Stone said.
Other factors contributing to the decline in sexual activity include less social interaction and more social drinking during the pandemic.
The study also showed that the likelihood of sex is lower for people who are unemployed or have lower incomes.
Another reason may be the proliferation of digital media, which seems to reduce the need for sex.
People are spending more time online, which is "replacing" this need.
This trend has been particularly pronounced during the lockdown in the time of the coronavirus pandemic.
The whole mandate is about whether society should force a portion of the population to behave in a way that they don't want, but which could save their lives.
It's a pretty difficult question, and the one I'm most interested in is the question of social conscience.
That is, for example, the question of whether if we don't do it and they die, then it will be our fault.
My argument is that we could certainly have done better for the 80-year-old man who didn't really know what was going on, we didn't explain it to him well enough, he heard some misinformation, and as a result, he didn't get vaccinated and ended up catching it and died.
On the other hand, I don't think we can blame the death of a staunch anti-vaccinationist who, alongside the SPD and the KSČ, has been shouting about bullying and a totalitarian state.
From the statistics I mentioned, it's pretty clear that most of the unvaccinated pensioners are probably in the second group, so they'll have to take care of themselves.
The Czech Republic without snow.
How does a mild winter help in the fight against drought?
This winter so far in the Czech Republic has brought one of the smallest snowfalls in recent times.
Ski resort operators will not be able to do without technical snow, the weather complicates even the preparation of the Jizerské padesátka cross-country skiing race.
Is it a trend or an exception?
And what will a lack of snow mean for the fight against drought in the Czech Republic?
I have one story, but it's not about a breadwinner.
One time in middle school, our teacher took us all over town to the boatyard so we could ride the boats down the river.
On our way there, we walked down a fairly wide street, and we couldn't see anyone in the middle - Hare Krishna sect followers.
Of course, they hit us.
I was lucky to escape, but with one of my friends we got into a fight.
When she left, we asked her and her teacher what she told them.
"They asked me if I wanted to save my soul.
I told them I didn't have a soul," she said.
Everyone, including the teacher, laughed all the way to the shipyard.
We are so out of touch.
Nothing much is happening, but the system is breaking down, says Orozovič
Olaf Scholz, the new German chancellor, arrived in Warsaw on Sunday after previous visits to Paris and Brussels, where he was greeted with military honors by Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki.
"We are opening a new chapter in our relations," Morawiecki said at a joint press conference after the meeting.
Scholz stressed that Europe must show together that it will not accept the violation of Ukraine's territorial integrity.
The crisis caused by the disturbing movements of Russian troops near the Ukrainian border should be resolved with the help of diplomatic efforts, including within the "Normandy Group", which brings together France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine.
Morawiecki said the chancellor had been informed about the situation at the Polish border with Belarus, where its leader Alexander Lukashenko has artificially created a migration crisis and uses people as live targets and weapons, as hundreds of attempts to cross the border are recorded every night.
He has been negotiating with the Chancellor about further sanctions so that the Lukashenko regime and its patrons in the Kremlin finally understand that we are determined to defend the eastern border of the EU.
According to the DPA agency, Scholz assured that Warsaw is benefiting from German support in the dispute with Belarus, and condemned the inhumane treatment of Lukashenko's regime towards refugees.
The drunk Polish nun caused the accident, she tried to cover it up
The car returned to the scene of the accident after a while, but the driver was another nun who was trying to take the blame.
When the police told her that she could lose her driving license for failing to give way and failing to stop at the scene of an accident, she came out with the truth, TVN24 reported.
She admitted that another nun ran into the vehicle and asked for help.
Then the police came for Sister Celestine.
She was breathalyzed and found to have over two percent alcohol in her system, whereupon her driver's license was immediately revoked.
She was also informed that she would confess to her actions in court.
Hugo is doing what he can.
Juraj Šajmovič, however, did not overlook his film.
Czech creators of family comedies looked at American stories about dog lovers.
But they forgot one important thing: the rules of the film industry.
After the hilarious film F. Brabce's Gump - the dog who taught people how to live, another film is now taking care of the audience's emotions in cinemas.
The screenplay co-author and director Juraj Šajmovič Jr. continues the story of his previous film Here I Am from 2012.
The talking badger Hugo returns to the stage with some familiar faces around him.
Julie and Ivan, the owners of the Šumava pension that is closing down, so they start to invite dog owners, Julie's father and his partner, and especially her daughter Veronika.
She is no longer a little girl, but a young woman experiencing her first love.
The director and his partner Beatriz Šajmovičová (who is also the film's producer) struggled with the storytelling in the previous film, but at least the children and the dog were entertained.
This time, the creative duo wrote a weaker script that evokes a mix of fear and feelings of dread.
Let's sum it up.
Although a scientist, Julie is overcome by the desire for a child, and if the right "constellation" comes, she copulates with her forest engineer Ivan, wherever the coordinates just happen to be – on the car's hood or the church tower (of course, during the ongoing excursion with a local guide), the retired colonel Mojmír shoots his own daughter (Julie), who falls into a coma, after which the family is taken to the hospital so that the miraculous healing process can take place in the heart of the Šumava forest.
Nothing against the cleansing power of nature and the power of animal lovers.
Their owners know why they have them.
But the viewer is shocked by the amount of content, filled with unrealistic situations and figures, that is required for this message.
A pair of staff thieves, a dog show judge, a charlatan from Šumava, police officers on the hunt for "drugs," and a discussion of herbs with bone-meal fertilizing power - and the baked family at the boarding house, of course, get drunk on it.
When the heroine wakes up from a coma and sits down at the family table with a cigar and a glass of her father's whisky as a recovered vegetarian, you can't help but laugh.
The creators also explain to the viewer that "this sometimes happens after a coma."
The team of Šajmovič lacks basic dramaturgical knowledge of working with the text, the ability to build up the main situations, the sense for the characters and the point and the direction.
The acting is uneven, the editing is disjointed and the overall impression is muddled.
While Lukáš Vaculík, Jitka Ježková and Nela Boudová try to keep their parties afloat, they have little to play for.
The only flaw of the film remains the poetic footage of the Šumava nature by cameraman Vladimír Holomka and the pair of lynx.
It's not enough to sketch out a few characters, a shoddy plot and dog-like vulgarities, let alone the more vulgar slang the characters use.
The argument is not that she has been a member of the Badger Breeders' Club - as in the case of the producer.
With good intentions to promote nature and man's friendship with the dog, there must also be knowledge of the craft if one is to tell a believable story.
In this case, it didn't work out.
There's a little too much eroticism and a minimum of respect for the genre for a good family film.
Even as an advertisement for canasta therapy, this amateurish piece wouldn't pass.
Yes, respect, because they have to listen to nonstop name-calling from people like you.
There is a difference between offering and coercing, here you see how you do it, but that's only because you've never tried it.
The decision is always up to the customer, if they don't want it, the answer will always be no.
If you listened to kids like that, you might change your mind.
It's a job like any other, in this case a gig for profit.
The Middle East is experiencing unusually dry months.
Winter is the only time of the year when it rains.
"Almost complete absence of rainfall in November, as we have recorded at some stations, is unusual," the Israel Meteorological Service confirms.
For example, Kfar Giladi, a village in northern Israel, reports only six percent of its long-term rainfall in November.
The two days of rain this week were therefore more of an exception.
It's good for us.
It hasn't rained for a long time.
It is also the right Christmas star, said the resident of Nazareth Wasim Ashkar.
Rainfall in Israel occurs almost exclusively in the winter months, is sudden and irregular.
The forests are dependent on the winter rains.
Without them, they dry out and are prone to fires.
It's not just about forests, but also about water and irrigation for farmers.
Israel's largest freshwater source, the Sea of Galilee, has been filled to the brim this spring thanks to three consecutive rainy winters.
Since then, the level has been falling.
Water managers have been warning of the drought for a long time.
"It is expected that, depending on global warming and climate change, rainfall will decrease," said Uri Schor, a spokesman for the Israeli Water Authority, in 2018.
Israel can help with technologies such as desalination or wastewater recycling.
The poorer countries, such as Lebanon, Syria and Jordan, are worse off.
In the streets of the Jordanian capital, Amman, the cisterns are filling up.
Water mains and private wells are drying up.
"This year, orders have increased by 70 to 80 percent compared to the previous two years," tanker driver Imád Sulejman reported in September.
Clashes broke out between farmers and security forces in Isfahan, Iran.
The reason for the protests was the drought.
The local river was completely dry.
The region has had the driest November in many years.
Israel is preparing a military strike against Iran
Israel's defense minister said the Vienna talks had not produced "any progress" and that he had informed Washington of plans to attack Iran's nuclear facilities.
Defense Minister Benny Gantz said Saturday that he ordered the Israeli military to prepare for a military strike against Iran, according to Jonathan Lis.
Gantz, who lives in the United States, is trying to persuade Americans to step up their pressure on Iran, but he has also been briefing Washington on military preparations.
During a press conference in Florida, Gantz said that the Vienna talks had "made no progress" and that the world powers "understand that Iran is playing with them."
About three years ago, this happened to me as well.
I liked her a little bit and grilled her during the interview to find out what she really wanted from me.
In the end, I discovered that my suspicions about the pyramid were justified.
Because I really don't like these undercovers, I asked her a few questions and then thanked her and left.
Feel free to call me a crook, but a pyramid is a pyramid and financial advisors are financial advisors.
Skiers headed into the mountains for the weekend, with plenty of snow and good weather
Mountain resorts in the Czech Republic have seen their first major surge in interest in skiing this weekend.
After a heavy snowfall at the end of the working week, there is no longer any need for snow chains, and some ski resorts have started to open.
The organiser was not deterred by the requirement to show a Covid certificate for the tractors.
While skiers are complaining about the lack of interest from customers, some ski equipment rental companies are reporting lower demand for their services than before the epidemic.
Thousands of people flocked to running tracks and ski slopes over the weekend in Liberec region.
The skiers were treated to sunshine and excellent snow conditions.
"We are satisfied that the opening weekend really started from the Friday evening skiing, when we had the first skier on the hill," said the director of the Ještěd Sports Complex Jakub Hanuš.
Hundreds of people also headed to Jeseníky for the first skiing weekend of the new season.
For example, the Ski Aréna Karlov or the center in Branná in Šumperk were opened.
The weekend attendance was very good, with an estimated 400 people attending on Saturday and today.
The conditions are poor.
Today the sun shone, it was minus three degrees, so it was perfect, praised the representative of the ski resort in Branná Rostislav Procházka.
Ski resort operators can only sell lift passes to people who are vaccinated or who have recovered from a COVID-19 infection.
People are ready to do this, and they are showing the necessary documents, said René Hroneš from the Špindlerův Mlýn sketch centre.
"We only recorded one incident," he added.
Some ski rental and equipment shops are reporting lower than normal demand.
The interest in renting skis is fortunately high.
It's not like in previous years, but there are still enough customers, said Alexandra Bokišová from the Skiopava store in Opava.
More pressure is expected during the ski season.
Also, the CEO of the Kralupy company Snowbear, David Šinták, feels that due to covid, there is not as much interest in renting ski equipment as before.
Before the pandemic, we were already almost on a loan.
Compared to the pre-pandemic period, we are about 50 percent, said Šinták to ČTK.
People, according to him, got lazy with the pandemic and learned to sit at home.
On the other hand, there is a big demand for rentals at Novako's campus in Božji Dar.
They started renting skis a week ago, and now you have to book them in advance.
"We're starting to rent bikes this weekend, but people have already been calling ahead, so we're expecting a lot of interest, just like last year," said Pavlína Nováková, the venue's operator.
Interest in the ski school is comparable to the pre-epidemic period, according to her.
If we want the successful and wealthy to stay here, they need to be able to live a good life here like they do abroad.
Socialist health care is not the place to go if you want to see a dentist or a specialist.
Smart and savvy people who don't have any assets leave the country.
The owner of the company does not just go abroad.
But I totally agree with the rest of it.
If these people do not live well in the Czech Republic and if these people do not have a vision of a reasonable future in the Czech Republic, then they will not live in the Czech Republic.
The emigration from Hungary started when Orbán won one day, ruled for a year and suddenly the annual emigration rose by a few thousand.
It is naive to think that the Czech Republic cannot find itself in such a position on a daily basis.
The other issue is the elections.
If it's bad there, then some traditional V4 lunatic could win it too.
The young and educated will leave, leaving behind his supporters and the people whose property can't fit on the plane.
Awful photo!
Langmajer in blood because of a beer bet?
While autumn was in full swing in the Czech Republic, the film crew, led by Jiří Langmajer (55), was enjoying the tropical weather in Thailand!
The actor posted a bloody photo of his face on social media.
Is it a real injury or is it just for the shoot?
The London police are still looking for the missing Czech woman.
She was last seen on her way home.
"Petrina's disappearance is not at all like her behaviour and we are starting to get very concerned about her," said Lucy O'Connor, a police officer in the Lambeth area where Srncova worked, in a video posted on Saturday.
"Her family in the Czech Republic are also very worried about her and simply want to know where she is," she continued.
The Czech woman was reported missing around 7:45 p.m. on Sunday, November 28, and was last seen heading home to the Camberwell area.
She was reportedly last seen on a bus about half an hour later.
She was reported missing on December 3 by one of her co-workers.
Srncová, according to British media, worked as a "nurse's assistant" at the Evelina London Children's Hospital, which is part of the Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital Trust.
"We are extremely concerned for our colleague Petra, who is missing," a group of medical facilities tweeted.
"We would urge anyone with any information to contact police," the statement continued.
The public has also been urged to come forward to help with the investigation by MP Harriet Harman, who raised the case at a press conference on Saturday.
"She's been missing for several days, she's only 32 years old, she's from the Czech Republic, her parents are obviously devastated," the Labour politician said, holding up a photograph of the woman distributed by the London police.
"I feel like we all have a really big responsibility to try and find her because she was out of her home country, away from her family, and working here for our health care," Harman said.
Police have previously arrested one man in connection with the incident, who remains in custody.
However, the BBC news website says police have not released any information about his identity or what he is suspected of.
Russia is not capable of occupying Ukraine, and certainly not with 30 BTG (about 5 divisions).
I don't underestimate Ukraine either.
It's not "a huge number," but about 8 percent of the Russian army.
Notice that Ukraine keeps saying that the threat of invasion is exaggerated and that our entry is full of teeth.
I quoted above.
I don't know what he thinks Russia wants to do.
War is a sacred game and Russia has Italy's GDP.
Comparisons to the situation in 1938 are off in so many ways that I don't even know where to start.
I can compare this to the First Punic War and the "annexation" of Sicily:D
I can imagine that after Ukraine announced that it would not abide by the Minsk agreements, Russia annexed those ridiculous republics.
That's all there is to it, and that's what the "concentration" at the border would correspond to.
That is, pacta sunt servanda...
New traffic regulations come into effect in Prague from Sunday, affecting mainly suburban connections
Passengers in Prague's integrated transport (PID) are waiting for several changes, which mainly concern suburban connections.
New routes have been created, some have changed their routes, and others have disappeared.
Mladoboleslavsko is now being integrated into the integrated system.
In the capital, express trains from České Budějovice stop at the Zahradní Město station from Sunday.
The suburban trains S7 will run from Beroun to Český Brod via Prague main station.
The new Prague-Zahradní Město station will be served by the R17 express train from České Budějovice and Benešov.
PID will be expanded to other areas.
In addition, buses go as far as Světlá nad Sázavou, Blatna u Jesenice, Staré Splavy and Turnov.
Buses will be added to the Mladoboleslav region, including lines extending to Liberec and Hradec Králové.
77 lines will be cancelled, 37 new ones will be introduced and the operation of 12 existing ones will be improved.
From Zličín in Prague, a new bus line 405 will depart, which will go all the way to Žatec.
There is also a new direct connection between Prague and Kralovice near Rakovník, which replaces the cancelled line S53.
They will be increased in the morning rush hour and on weekends the new express line number 404 will leave from Prague to Rakovník.
The lines 400 and 410 running to Liberec are now included in the PID system.
They leave from Střížkov metro station, not from Nádraží Holešovice.
Line 400 runs through Mělník, Dubá and Česká Lípa to Nové Bor and selected connections continue to Rumburk or Cvikov.
The additional line 410 runs through Mělník and Dubá to Doksy, Mimona and Jablonné in Podještědí.
On the contrary, the operation of dozens of local tracks in Central Bohemia has been cancelled or restricted, for example, to Mochov, Dobříš or Rožmitál pod Třemšínem.
All trains leaving Prague at 02:30 have been cancelled.
Due to the modernization of the railway, long-term restrictions are still in place on the lines Prague – Beroun, Prague – Lysá nad Labem and in the vicinity of Kolín.
Changes are also in store for passengers at other locations.
Buses replace some of the cancelled railway lines or extend the line 420 from Dobříš with a connection to Prague, where PID tickets can be used up to Milevsko.
The routes of lines 540 to 543 in Nymburk have changed, and the routes of some buses on the border of Central Bohemia and the Hořovicka region in the Plzeň region have been altered.
Healthy lunch/snacks from the supermarket
Hi, I work a classic 9-5 with a 30-minute break and my only option to get food is to go next door to Billy or a bit further down to Lidl.
Since I don't have any movement, I don't have the strength to exercise after work, so I have to eat as healthy as possible and diet.
Unfortunately, I never know what to buy and in a hurry, I buy a pizza bagel and a yogurt and an apple.
Question: What healthy, non-heat-treated foods would you recommend I buy at the supermarket?
Not everyone is waiting for a foot of snow like you are, unfortunately.
And it's not the trees you have to see.
Only the tip of the tree can hide under the snow.
If damaged, the tree may be more susceptible to fungal diseases.
I'm not saying that's the only reason we're not allowed to go off-road, but it's one of them.
Dara's confession about her relationship with Nedved: I didn't expect this at all
The Czech show business pond has been living for nothing but the revelation of the relationship between Dara Rolins and Pavel Nedved since Friday.
They've been together since the summer, and the famous footballer even got divorced because of the singer.
Dara has now sent a lengthy message to her fans explaining why she kept her love a secret for six months.
"I can say that there is no one in the Czech Republic or Slovakia who would not know that Dara has caught a bear, sorry, Nedved," Dara Rolins, who is in love with the most successful Czech footballer, jokes.
However, he allegedly dumped her, not the other way around.
Three days are the focus of attention, and although they're used to the public eye, they don't enjoy it.
And it is here.
What we didn't want, but knew would happen, continues the singer.
I just don't know who's worse off.
If you don't care about it and it comes out of the can on them, or us, whose lives are being dissected in minute detail.
As if someone wanted to hear your opinion on whether you and your husband or girlfriend are a good match, or you insisted that everyone knew the details of your ex-partners and were familiar with the list of your mistakes and blunders.
That's what you want, that's what you want, that's what you want, that's what you want, that's what you want, that's what you want, that's what you want, that's what you want, that's what you want, that's what you want, that's what you want, that's what you want, that's what you want, that's what you want, that's what you want, that's what you want, that's what you want, that's what you want, that's what you want.
The pair reunited in Italy, where Rollins was traveling to prepare for her new fashion collection.
Nedvěd has also been vice president of the Juventus football club for a long time.
They only came out with the truth now because they were waiting for Nedved's divorce to be finalized.
Ivan and his wife Ivana have been separated for three years, but not legally for three weeks.
To those who are celebrating with us and wishing us well, thank you.
We are just people, we have families, children, past and dreams.
We're not perfect, but I think we both have our hearts in the right place.
That's why I love my new man and just as he stands by me, so do I. In good times and bad, Rolins concluded.
Hey, everyone else has probably said all the important things, but I'll confirm that the dorms are great to start with, my classmates mostly met and made friends during the first semester or two and then found flats together, which I think is the best option, because you know who you're going to be living with.
Apartments are usually listed for a long time in advance, so you probably won't find anything right now, but it's worth checking out the listings just to see what's out there.
Otherwise, be sure to avoid not only Cejl, but also the surroundings (streets like Vranovská, Francouzská, etc., that's a pretty bad address), and some parts of Žižkov are a bit of a ghetto.
On the other hand, Veveří is very student-friendly, Kralovo pole and in that direction it's great, but it's also close to most of VUT's faculties (I don't know where you're going exactly).
I have never looked for a rental, but I am a native of Brno, so I can help you with Brno as such, if you need any more information :)
But that's exactly the kind of "normal" thinking I'm talking about.
Because of what a few doctors decided to do somewhere in Poland, it's actually quite okay that the state doesn't sufficiently fund some schools.
Either let them learn what they want and pay for it themselves, or let them drive on the state's roads and pay for them.
We can't allow a private actor to control education just because he adds a few crowns to the full state contribution and thereby allows children to learn whatever they want.
Such a statement loses some of its weight when it is written by a person who, two days earlier, said this about a petition for a boycott of the totalitarian state:
So voting against whether or not someone should have an abortion is the same as voting against whether or not a statue should stand in the square?
I would consult with the person who hired you directly about this.
Otherwise, I've already experienced that (and even long-time professionals) either throw it away or write something like xxx *** or ... (by convention) and in the note that it's unreadable.
The truth is, in this case, it's quite readable, so I wouldn't really recommend it.
Personally, I would probably deal with it in some kind of note depending on what program you're using.
If you want to be a good and diligent student, you can look up some dictionaries and find the nearest one.
But since it looks like you're drawing from a book, I'd guess that the author or printer simply created their own mark that matches what's physically on the coin.
PS: It's not a coincidence that it's called the OdryNská říše (kingdom) rather than the OdryNská?
PSS: Someone has already torn this place apart.
Check out the comment with ΦΙΛH
Politicians don't know what the "theme" of our presidency will be.
That's a lot worse than having interpreters with them.
The idea that they would approve something because no one understood the text is laughable.
All important approved documents are scrutinised word for word, and even a basic knowledge of English isn't enough, it's a lawyer's job.
Hundreds of translators and interpreters work in the EU institutions, and English is more suited to politicians for informal contacts, forging unusual relationships.
And with the English, it's quite interesting, after the UK's departure from the EU.
I don't understand the hatred for Cejl.
I've been working there for three years now and I'm very happy.
How many times do I leave work at 10 p.m. and never have a problem?
That it's a ghetto can only be said by someone who hasn't stepped foot in it in their life.
Yes, most of the Roma population of Brno lives there, but they do nothing but block the sidewalk and park where they don't belong:D It's definitely not that I'd be afraid to go out on the street there at night.
So if you're looking for relatively inexpensive housing with good access to the centre, I'd go for it.
There are now newly renovated or newly built apartments.
Felix Slováček (78) without Dada and his girlfriend Gelemová as a stake in the ground!
Who will he spend Christmas with?
Most people lit their first Advent candle on Sunday, but Felix Slováček didn't.
I don't have an advent wreath, so there was nothing to light.
I've seen a wreath, and I'm sure Lucie has one too, said the saxophonist, who confirmed Patras' words that he visits her often.
She visits, but does not live in their Vinohrady home, where Dada was left alone after his departure.
The Slovak still doesn't know where he will be on Christmas Eve.
Recently, we met with Anička, Felix and both grandchildren.
VIDEO: Felix Slováček and Lucie Gelemová: TOGETHER AGAIN!
Felix Slováček and Lucie Gelemová: TOGETHER AGAIN!
But we still talked, so Christmas didn't happen.
I really don't know where I'll be.
I buy gifts all the time, and I'm sure I'll get something for Dad and Lucia, maybe a perfume.
I'm a gentleman," added Felix, who himself attended the christening of a music video at the Richman club.
I'm here alone, but I don't feel alone.
I always find someone to have fun with, says the Slovák, who was happy to meet the wife of Ludek Sobota, Adriana, or the singer Kamila Nývltová.
And he was very clear about that.
And we are Iceland, so we can afford not to have soldiers and weapons?
I doubt anyone will come to our defence and our location is so strategically important that an aggressor would have to be a complete idiot not to occupy the territory.
And I don't understand why that would be a bad argument, so can you explain that to me?
I don't know of any other component that could be deployed to hospitals in a crisis.
There are few police officers and they can't afford to do it, firefighters can't afford to do it, and there's nowhere else in the country that has such a high percentage of medically trained people at this level.
And the fact that our army is capable of defending Ostrava is a slap in the face for previous governments, not the army, which has been asking for new toys for a long time.
Record drought in the Czech Republic.
Agricultural subsidies need to be changed, the journalist says, because the countryside is not just a food factory.
The Czech Republic is going through the worst drought in years.
Scientists say water levels have dropped in mountainous and sub-alpine areas, and smaller amounts of rainfall have been recorded in places where water shortages have not previously been an issue.
The drought in large parts of central Europe is caused by climate change.
But the impact is also heightened by the way we manage the land.
What can we do to prepare for the drought?
And how can we help nature in times of trouble?
Yeah, that's it, I can barely keep my skates on the ice, I don't know what hockey is, and the tactics (which I tried in the Franchise Hockey Manager) are a total mess.
And whether you're the "Russian Bear" hockey team or the "Chinese Llama" hockey team, losing by two goals when you don't have to win the game at all costs is different than when it's tied.
But as I listen to the Czech commentators, who are so critical, they notice everything, whether it's men's or women's hockey, it's all strange, but it's like that with all sports, UEFA and "Italian actors" or motorsport F1, WRC, etc.
The controversy is everywhere.
And I think if it was the other way around, it would be like it's always been, and that the Czech Republic and Russia have lost more often than they've won, then it would be a classic "they lost" vs "we won".
Coronavirus: Russia surpasses 10 million cases
On Saturday, 11 December, the Czech Republic recorded 9,080 daily cases.
5766 people have been hospitalized.
A total of 34,451 people died in the Czech Republic, and another 74.
The number of confirmed cases in the Czech Republic in the last 14 days is 1967 per 100,000, and 871 per 100,000 in the last week.
The number of cases in Russia exceeded 10 million on Sunday.
In the last 24 hours, 29,929 new cases have been registered.
It is the lowest daily count since October 13.
The total number of registered cases of disease in Russia is 10,016,896.
The daily death toll is 1,132, the lowest since the end of October.
Britain is facing an "inevitable" wave of infections caused by Omicron, said Dr Susan Hopkins, chief medical adviser to the UK Health Security Agency, on television on Sunday.
New quarantine measures will be required.
People infected with Omicron are already being admitted to hospital in Britain, and Hopkins expects the number to rise.
So far, no one has died from omicron, but hospitalizations are about 14 days after infection and deaths are about three weeks after infection.
Labour leader Keir Starmer said on Sunday that Boris Johnson may have broken the law by hosting a Christmas quiz in Downing Street last December, when lockdown was in place and Christmas parties were banned.
One minister in Johnson's government defended the quiz as "virtually" taking place on a computer.
But they were attended by groups of staff gathered around computers in Downing Street.
In Britain, pressure is mounting to remove Johnson from the premiership.
Last December, when a strict lockdown was imposed in London and Christmas parties were banned, Johnson's ministers held numerous parties despite the lockdown.
The British public and media are furious that Johnson and his government have made a mockery of them:
Paul Brand, ITV's commercial editor for Britain: Two years ago today, Boris Johnson won an overwhelming majority in the general election.
This morning, the Conservative Party is talking about removing him from the post of Prime Minister.
Remarkable how quickly things have developed.
Do you want to turn around and save your skin?
Hungarians are set to go to the polls in the spring, which could see Viktor Orban's 12-year rule come to an end.
They will be elections of global significance.
How fair can they be?
They won't be fair.
They probably won't be free either, because they weren't last time either.
His Fidesz party controls the media, changes the boundaries of electoral districts to benefit from it, and does other small or large tricks.
The last one sounds like everyone can vote wherever they want in practice.
This will allow Fidesz to transport voters from the contested districts to those where the outcome is uncertain and the opposition could win.
So I'll just reiterate that they're not going to be fair at all.
Do you think it will be as nefarious as it was in 2014 and 2018?
After all, the situation is very different.
It used to be that it wasn't whether Fidesz would win, but how much and whether it would have a constitutional majority.
Now there is a real chance that more votes and seats will be won by the united opposition.
This is a big surprise for Viktor Orbán and his party.
Will they play harder to keep power?
Yes, we have some indications that they are ready to go beyond what they have done in the past.
Recently, a recording of the speaker of the parliament and one of the leaders of Fidesz, László Kövér, leaked to the independent media, where he explains to the heads of the secret services that the opposition is a threat to national security.
Those are the hints of a new approach you're talking about?
Yes, that's one of the new features.
It all starts with language.
I've been beaten up a lot, the last time was at 14, my mother's parents don't have much patience, I don't either, my dad has for a long time, but then he explodes extremely (only in relation to me).
I was also very temperamental and I would get really angry, to the point where I would lie on the floor in convulsions and they would take me into the shower twice to calm me down.
Sometimes they would lecture me, sometimes it was more like they didn't know anymore.
I definitely have a tendency to solve things with violence, as a child I was quite violent, now I hit at least something to get out and as a younger I may have slapped my parents over the hand (so as not to get too much over the mouth), so never anything extreme, but I always have this urge.
I'm not able to pinpoint to what extent that is my volatility, but I'm sure my upbringing had a lot to do with it.
I'm afraid I'll lose my patience with my kids and deal with it the same way.
I think hitting children is just wrong and that my parents shouldn't have done it, especially not at a time when it was no longer "educational," but out of frustration, on the other hand, every parent does something wrong with their kids, so I don't blame them.
I don't care, I don't understand why the OP should feel ashamed.
Laws should be clear and unambiguous.
I would call those who make laws of such quality.
Otherwise, I'd be interested to know if you're worried about power outages.
Can you really count on people wanting and buying the product and you having a mortgage to pay for it?
The world of Kočner.
Where will Slovakia move the trial of the killers of journalist Kuciak?
The main trial in the case of the murder of Ján Kuciak and Martina Kušnírová begins in Slovakia.
The death of the investigative reporter and his partner changed Slovakia.
It mobilised civil society, but also exposed the practices of the accused businessman Marián Kočner and his connections to the top of Slovak politics and justice.
How important will the trial be for Slovakia?
This is something journalists can really get behind.
How is it possible that this petition received far more media attention than the petition by the deans of all the medical schools that came out the next day, two days later?
Well, they got sick and the company got away with it.

Another government ends and the law on the involvement of municipalities in the selection of a storage site nowhere
Minister Karel Havlíček's proposal needs to be fundamentally revised
The government of Prime Minister Andrej Babiš is coming to an end, and the law that was supposed to ensure respect for the interests of municipalities and their citizens in selecting and permitting deep-sea storage of high-level radioactive waste is still not in place.
The government's legislative council has suspended consideration of a proposal submitted to the government by the Ministry of Industry and Trade after years of delays.
However, its content is in serious conflict not only with the affected municipalities, which are part of the Platform Against Deep Storage, but also with the Association of Municipalities and Towns of the Czech Republic.
The municipalities expect to see a more significant strengthening of their options in deciding on the repository, which has been promised to the mayors since 2011, when the first work on this legislation began and which is required by the Czech Atomic Act and the European directive.
We expect the new government to revise the proposal in line with its coalition agreement in cooperation with the municipalities.
The proposal by Minister Karel Havlíček, which is available on the Platform, is criticised by municipalities in particular: The proposed level of involvement of municipalities and the public in the decision-making process on the selection of a site for the repository is insufficient and cannot guarantee respect for the interests of municipalities and their citizens.
It can only be truly effective if the municipalities or the public can influence whether the process will continue in a particular location.
This can be achieved by requiring the Land Registry to obtain the consent of the affected municipalities before starting a specific procedure.
The draft proposal almost completely omits public involvement and makes the citizens of the municipalities practically mere statistics in the permitting process.
The proposal lacks the system setting up compensation for municipalities for the whole process of finding and selecting a site for a repository, its authorisation and operation.
Municipal officials have little choice in defending the interests of their citizens in the search for a storage site, according to today's legal standards.
Only in certain permits can comments or appeals be made, but the decision is made by the authority or the minister in whose interest the permit is to be issued.
Any appeal does not have the effect of suspending the execution of exploration or construction works.
The co-decision of local authorities, which the Platform is calling for, is a principle that is commonly used in many democratic countries and certainly in those that have already made progress in setting up repositories, such as Sweden and Finland.
The drafting of the law is another failure of the state administration, which hires external law firms to draft legislation.
In this case, it is a contract with the law firm HAVEL & PARTNERS s.r.o., which SÚRAO has entered into following contracts with lawyer Jan Zemánek.
The total sum for these works is estimated to be around CZK 4 million, according to the register of contracts.
Antonín Seknička, the deputy mayor of the village of Hrádek and the spokesman for the Platform against Deep Landfill, said: "After the ministers of industry, who only deferred to their successors the alignment of the position of municipalities vis-à-vis state authorities in the search for a deep landfill of highly radioactive waste, we expect a more significant change from the new government.
We are also offering a helping hand.
We also thank the Association of Municipalities and Cities for their support, which sees the issue of the lack of rights of municipalities for such a fundamental building in the same way as the directly affected municipalities in selected locations.
The Deep Storage Platform brings together 51 members (35 municipalities and towns and 16 associations) to push for a change in the state's approach to the management of spent nuclear fuel and other radioactive waste, which will not be limited to deep storage.
The platform further advocates that the decision on the selection of a site for possible storage be subject to the prior consent of the affected municipalities.
John Goodman, 69, was forced to shed pounds of fear: He lost 90 pounds.
While he had not needed to change his lifestyle for many years, he was eventually scared by the doctors.
They told him if he didn't lose weight, he would die.
And that's what happened.
Goodman has gradually lost 90 kilograms, which is half his original weight of 180 kilograms, reports The Sun.
He showcased his new character at the premiere of the animated series The Freak Brothers in Los Angeles.
The Roseanne cast member is a completely different person!
John liked to joke that his friends and family begged him to lose weight because his big body was causing furniture to break.
"I've swallowed everything," the actor said in a 2018 interview with AARP.
This time I wanted to do it slowly.
To move, to exercise.
I'm getting to an age where I can't afford to sit still, said ABC's Goodman, whose transformation is amazing.
It also depends on what kind of boss and what you want to use the word "boss" for.
If it's a text on a platform that expects readers from a gaming environment, I wouldn't translate it.
If it was a formal text or perhaps a university text, I'd be looking for a way to describe or explain the boss.
There are more kinds of bosses.
For example, a game like Dark Souls has several bosses, yes, and so the "boss" is something like a lord/ruler of a given level, and then there's the final boss...
Many games have hidden bosses (super bosses, hidden bosses) that are not necessary to defeat in order to complete the game or level, but are often stronger than the standard boss.
Then there are games like Half-Life, where the bosses are there, but the player doesn't fight them directly (Tentacle, Gargantua), and can they even be called bosses?
And then there are the mini-bosses.
It is impossible to translate the boss in a single word, neither Czech nor other languages solve this problem (it is interesting that only Catalan, which translates the boss as the final opponent, solves this problem).
It's basically a story or game-generally significant, computer-controlled, adversary stronger than all the previous ones and guarding completion of some level or task.
The world is searching for a lost Peter from London.
The Czech police also got involved.
The British police have been searching for missing Petře Srncová since December 3.
The Czech police are also involved in the search.
The 32-year-old woman from Uherskohradišťsko has been missing since December 7.
He is also helping the British police through Interpol.
Ms. Srncová's colleagues last saw her on November 28.
British police have been looking for her since December 3.
Interpol issued a so-called yellow notice for her.
Peter is being sought by the whole world.
"The Czech police cooperate closely with the British police," confirmed police spokeswoman Kateřina Rendlová.
"We share information on the case," she added.
The announcement of the search for Peter has already appeared on the police website.
He said she was 168 centimetres tall, was skinny and had brown eyes and long, straight hair of the same colour.
She should be from Uherskohradišťsko.
Petra worked as a nurse in one of London's hospitals.
Her friends and colleagues are worried about her disappearance, as such disappearances are very unusual
Harriet Harman, the Labour MP for Camberwell and Peckham, has also joined the hunt for Peter.
She was involved in putting up posters with Petra's face on them.
"We are very concerned about her," she said at a press conference on Saturday.
In connection with the disappearance, British police have already detained one suspect.
However, it is not clear who he is and what he has in common with Petra.
Christmas Eve in the Czech Republic is terrorized by Agent Tesla.
While data in October showed a slight decline in attack campaigns, the past month has seen a marked uptick in attacks as the end of the year approaches.
We recorded a major campaign in connection with Agent Tesla on November 18.
The attacks are aimed at the Czech Republic.
The attackers' strategy remains the same.
The infected attachment in the email will catch the user's attention with a name that refers to payments and financial transactions.
Last month, the dangerous attachment had the word "invoice" in its name, but this time it was marked as "Copy of correction of invoice for 11.2021...exe," said Martin Jirkal from ESET.
Spyware contains functions that scan Internet browsers and other programs, such as Microsoft Outlook email clients, Mozilla Thunderbird or Yandex.
The malicious code actively looks for stored login credentials and then sends them to the attackers.
The last strong campaign took place in the Czech Republic at the end of August and the beginning of September, and with the approaching holidays and the end of the year, the activity of the attackers increases again.
In November, the Formbook spyware remained active.
Unlike Agent Tesla, the attackers in this case are not specifically targeting the Czech Republic, and security specialists in November detected a campaign with a global reach.
Compared to October, FormBook fell slightly in November, but it still accounted for almost a fifth of all detections.
The attacks continued throughout the month with increased activity on the 3rd, 10th and 15th of November.
The Formbook most commonly contained an attachment with the .exe extension, named REQUEST FOR SPECIFICATION.
However, the receipt's name continues to appear.
The Czech annex can then be much more dangerous for the Czech user.
Security analysts have noted a significant drop in activity for the Fareit program, which accounted for 1.6 percent of attacks and has not mounted a major offensive campaign in the Czech Republic in recent months.

The Prague march was bigger than the media reports.
Based on the footage of the parade and my experience as a protester, I'm not afraid of an estimate of 10,000 people.
People in the procession filled the waterfront and the bridge and the opposite waterfront road.
That means a lot of people.
The march of some four thousand demonstrators is spontaneously joined by an unprecedented number of bystanders.
I say that something new is being born here, writes Radek Mokrý.
Persistent discontent of several large groups or strata of the population has led to the emergence of a common language.
Only the anti-vaxxers, the anti-Russians and so on would have been able to fill such a crowd and pay for it.
The Chcípl pes movement is gaining popularity, and reminds me of Million Moments for Democracy.
Sometimes I get the impression that they rent the same stage and the same equipment.
It is hard to say what movement would be able to pay for this discontent, not only the money, but also the fact that the three-dose vaccine from Pfizer becomes a four-dose vaccine.
It won't be a left-wing or centrist movement, that's for sure.
A three-dose vaccine will almost certainly become a multi-dose vaccine, because it's clear that we'll have to get revaccinated every six months.
I'm very glad that the vaccines saved us.
A brilliant feat of scientific ingenuity, which humanity is rightly proud of.
End of the tail, Bulgaria has a new prime minister calling for change
Bulgarian President Rumen Radev has appointed the new government of Kiril Petkov from the anti-corruption movement Continue the Change, which won the November elections.
He has managed to put together a broad coalition that should take office in a few days.
The political crisis in the country has been ongoing since April, when the previous government lost the elections under the weight of anti-corruption protests.
However, the winning parties that pledged to fight corruption and abuse of power were unable to reach an agreement, so two more early elections followed.

The "secretly" recorded footage is a global hit.
Concerns grew in Britain over the weekend over the fate of the 32-year-old Czech woman who has been missing for several days in London.
Petra Srncová was last seen two weeks ago driving home from work in the south of the British capital.
In addition to the police, her current employer or the MP for the London borough where she lived is also appealing for information.
"Petrina's disappearance is not at all like her behaviour and we are becoming increasingly concerned about her," said Lucy O'Connor, a police officer in the Lambeth area where Srncova worked, in a video posted on Saturday.
"Her family in the Czech Republic are also very worried about her and simply want to know where she is," she continued.
The Czech woman was reported missing from her Camberwell home around 7:45 p.m. on Sunday, November 28.
She was reportedly last seen on a bus about half an hour later.
She was reported missing on December 3 by one of her co-workers.
Srncová, according to British media, worked as a "nurse's assistant" at the Evelina London Children's Hospital, which is part of the Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital Trust.
"We are extremely concerned for our colleague Petra, who is missing," a group of medical facilities tweeted.
"We would urge anyone with any information to contact police," the statement continued.
An anonymous person has accused the amateur children's room painter Zdeňka Dvořáková Kocourková (also a county pirate councillor) of violating copyright.
However, the court ruled that Krtečka's paintings in the Šumperk rooms do not violate the law.
In Ústí nad Labem, a hole in the road in the form of a canal without a cover lasted for a month.
It was life or death.
The magistrate referred the complaints to the ŘSD, which owns the road, and because it did not respond, the hole continued to grow.
In the end, the authorities clarified the responsibilities and ownership, and after a month, the RSD "intensively dealt with the situation."
