In my opinion, the literature program was shaped by women of Balzac's age based on their interests.
We preferred Danilevsky and Volkonsky from Russian literature of the 19th century.
They wrote fiction, of course, from the point of view of those very women of Balzac's age.
And the psychology and torment of the heroines of Tolstoy and Turgenev are not so interesting for teenagers.
Teenagers are rarely interested in the psychology of the characters.
Thank you very much, it was very interesting.
Perhaps the roses were plush to represent a certain variety?
There are roses of this color and with this structure of the petal, which is reminiscent of velvet, as a rule, in dark red and burgundy tones.
And the light-colored roses look different, the petals have a satin or silk sheen.

The mattress Promtex Micropacket Prestige 105x195.
The “Micro-package Prestige” model: comfort and natural composition.
The mattress has different firmness on the sides: the medium-firm surface is made of latex coconut fiber and natural latex, and the moderately soft surface is made of natural latex.
The spring block with 1000 springs per square meter quickly adapts to the body of the sleeper, warning of the appearance of the "wave" or "gamma" effect.
Among the advantages of the model is the breathability of the material.
Latex, perforated for breathability, is naturally ventilated just like coconut shells.
This maintains a healthy microclimate in the sleeping area.
The mattress also comes with an extended warranty.
The official warranty period is 5 years, but the actual life of the mattress is longer.
Dust and dirt protection is provided by a removable Jacquard cover supplied with the kit.
Get an orthopedic pillow to go with your mattress - it's recommended for keeping the spine in an optimal position during sleep.
The filler determines the purpose of the sides – coconut serves as an anatomical support for the back, latex relaxes the muscles.

The computer teacher can't help either, he didn't learn this at school, the school plays Windows games.
So there's no support.
I remember the banquets and the guests at my parents' house with horror.
The guests are on the doorstep, and the chef is grilling the meatballs, while the mother is scrubbing the floor.
Lord, he's already sitting at the table without strength.
And then, after that, you have to wash the dishes, clean the house.
A week before the holiday, you're hauling groceries, two days cleaning, one day cleaning up after.
What about the guests?
They are fine, and they always have a cake with them.
Since then, I don't like parties or guests.
Even for my family, I set the table on the bare minimum.
And I make the little treats for them, I bake them all the time just for the fun of it.
Germany: Fourth coronavirus vaccine is inevitable
A fourth vaccine will be required in the summer or fall of 2022.
According to the expert, the current vaccination in Germany will not be the final one, but will continue with renewed vigour.
Despite an active vaccination campaign in Germany, two or three doses of the coronavirus vaccine are probably not enough to provide full protection.
The head of the Association of General Practitioners, Ulrich Weigelt, is convinced of this.
This was reported by Die Welt on Saturday, 11 December.
"We expect that the fourth vaccination will be needed in the summer, at the latest in autumn," the expert believes.
In addition, Weigelt hopes that the fourth coronavirus vaccine can be given "in combination with the flu vaccine".
This will help achieve the best results.
In addition, the strengthened vaccination may help in the fight against the spread of the new coronavirus strain "Omicron".
And the new variant is particularly dangerous.
Omicron is three times more likely to reinfect you than Delta or Beta strains.
This is evidenced by the preliminary study conducted in South Africa.
Based on this, BioNTech/Pfizer plan to provide an adapted vaccine for Omikron by March 2022.
The companies stressed that two doses of the vaccine do not provide sufficient protection against infection with the new Omicron coronavirus variant.
BioNTech and Pfizer's study found that the vaccine's effectiveness was significantly lower with two doses: "neutralising potential is reduced more than 25-fold".
"This indicates that two doses of BNT162b2 do not provide sufficient protection against infection with the omicron strain," BioNTech and Pfizer stressed.
Therefore, a third dose is required.
Experts are calling for a faster pace of vaccinations in the country.
For example, the president of the German Society of Infectious Diseases, Bernd Salzberger, advocates shortening the interval between the second and third vaccinations.
Moreover, Salzberger believes that accelerated vaccination will have an impact on the spread of both the delta variant and the omicron variant of the coronavirus.
“Israel’s experience is very convincing in this regard”, the expert stressed.
Voeller Pontoon21, Bet-A Vib, 54 Silent, 54 mm, 8.5 g.
The Bet-A-Vib series is a special branch of the Bet-A family from Pontoon21®.
It (as well as the Kalikana Vib series) differs from many other vibs in that it was originally designed with underwater fishing in mind, not just for baiting.
These baits have a greater specific gravity than similar-sized counterparts, which, without a doubt, has a positive impact on the nuances of using these interesting lures.
Another recognizable feature is the upper fin made of durable and elastic plastic, which creates additional vibration tones when the vertical and horizontal wires are used.
As a "winter vibe" when fishing for Bet-A-Vib, it demonstrates a fairly aggressive playstyle.
Often the most eye-catching is the simple monotonous animation, i.e. the up-and-down movement of the flipper with almost no pauses.
When planning, the deviation from the vertical axis is not very great, which is convenient when fishing in a limited space, cluttered with underwater vegetation, snags and other obstacles, for which it is possible to get a hold.
In addition, a small deviation is relevant when catching winter cod and largemouth bass, and especially in the middle of winter, when a point and aggressive presentation is required.
Reaching the extreme point of the trajectory, Bet-A-Vib instantly turns around and returns to its original vertical.
Bet-A-Vib is also successfully used for winter trout fishing.
To please her whims, you can choose between two modifications: with a noise capsule (NS – NanoSound) or without it (SL – Silent).
It was also noted that the Bet-A-Vib can irritate a passive fish, which does not even react to a live fish.
The Bet-A-Vib lure demonstrates range and accuracy.
This wobbler is understandable and not capricious, it fits well with the cord and braided cords even of large diameters.
For catching pike, bream, roach or perch, in addition to the uniform, the "step" is also useful, sometimes with "churning" on the bottom.
If you're fishing in tight places, you can swap the front triple for a double, which will reduce the chances of snagging.
Among its class, Bet-A-Vib is one of the most reliable and, as a result, one of the most easily caught.
It can be used with equal success on relatively shallow and fairly deep areas.
All models are equipped with Owner ST-36 hooks.

Libya says it has 7,000 Russian mercenaries
More than 7,000 mercenaries from a private military company (PMC) Wagner are stationed in Libya.
This was stated by the Chairman of the Supreme Council of the Republic, Khaled al-Mishri, on Sunday, December 12.
"Currently, there are more than 7,000 Wagner mercenaries in Libya.
They also have planes.
They are also digging trenches in Sirte and Kufra.
They have 30 jet fighters at the airbases of Ghardaia (also used as a civilian airport in Sirte), Anadolu Agency quotes him as saying.
Khaled al-Mishri also pointed out that Russian mercenaries "are trying to take over" the central part of Libya, stretching from Chad to the Mediterranean Sea, after "bringing their man to power" in the Central African Republic.
Maintain presence
According to the publication's source, Moscow was looking for a country to maintain its presence in North Africa and "located in Libya".
"Wagner" has been in Libya since 2019, using an airbase and port in Sirte, and an airbase in Jufra, according to the agency's report.
Russian authorities officially deny that the Wagner Group is supported by the Kremlin.
Where else could there be mercenaries?
According to the agency, Wagner is reportedly active in nine African countries - the Central African Republic, Libya, Sudan, Mozambique, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Madagascar, Zimbabwe and Angola.
The company provides military training for local forces, personal security for leaders, and protection of energy facilities.
In exchange for these services, Wagner's subsidiaries receive certain privileges and licenses to use mineral and natural resources, as well as to supply weapons, technologies and military services to these countries," the article says.
According to the media, the "Wagnerites" allegedly fought in the Donbas, Syria, Mozambique, Sudan and CAR.
This group is not listed in law enforcement agencies or the register of juristic persons, and its fighters are not listed in the personnel roster.
The company is under U.S. sanctions.
Earlier, the EU's 27 ambassadors approved restrictions against Wagner.
The Council of the European Union is expected to approve this decision on 13 December.
The situation in Libya
The Supreme Council of Libya de facto is the second chamber of parliament with advisory functions, writes TASS.
The body has repeatedly called for the single day of voting for the election of deputies of the parliament and the head of state to be postponed from 24 December at least until February 2022.
"Less than two weeks remain until the elections, and the chances of them being held on time are rapidly diminishing," the material notes.
Against this backdrop, the High Election Commission of Libya has postponed the announcement of the final list of candidates indefinitely, Sky News Arabia reports.
Foreign policy through the eyes of Russians
38% of Russians see more successes in the country's foreign policy than failures, 29% believe that failures predominate.
"Success examples - "we defended and restored peace in Syria", "the Nord Stream 2 decision", "the whole world was scared that the heavy weapons", "we got Crimea back".
The main failures are "conflict with Ukraine", "conflict with the West", "isolation from the world", the Public Opinion Foundation study says.
Dubai government has completely abandoned paper-based record-keeping - all government services are now digital only
Dubai government has announced a complete shift from paper-based filing to digital technology.
All public services to the population will also be provided exclusively in electronic form.
This was reported by the Emirati news agency WAM.
"Today marks the beginning of a new era of digitalisation of all aspects of Dubai's life - we have completed the transition to a completely paperless government," said the emirate's heir apparent, chairman of Dubai's executive council, Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, in a statement on Saturday.
Now, internal and external document circulation in all Dubai government entities will be carried out only in digital form through special information platforms.
The innovation has affected all sectors without exception: healthcare, housing, the police, municipal authorities, courts and so on. Many commercial structures have also joined the government's initiative.
The transition to an electronic government and the digitization of document circulation began in Dubai in 2018.
In that time, the authorities estimated, 336 million sheets of paper have been saved, amounting to 14 million hours of human labour and $353.8 million in cash equivalents.
Earlier, Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin stated that electronic services save citizens 2 days a year.
Dana, well, about the dates of birth and how old the child is, this is already a joke, about the class and the group in the kindergarten too.

My mother, her two brothers and grandfather and grandmother lived on the 3rd floor, which was without bars.
They first knocked on the door, then on the window, then decided not to be ceremonious and broke the window and got in, but grandpa had a baseball bat, which they got.
They knew there was someone in the house.
Turkey car production and exports fall below 2020 levels
Turkey's car production and exports fell sharply in November as the lira depreciated.
As a result, the industry's performance for the first 11 months of the year was worse than last year, Bloomberg reports, citing data from the Turkish Automobile Manufacturers Association.
According to the association, 115,000 cars were produced in Turkey in November, which is 20% less than a year earlier.
About 759,000 cars were exported, which is more than 25% less than last year.
And if, according to the results of the first 10 months of this year, the Turkish automotive sector demonstrated positive dynamics compared to last year, then according to the results of the 11 months of 2021, the production of cars was already 0.3% lower than the previous year's figure.
The reason for the fall was the sharp depreciation of the Turkish lira, which in November fell by 29% against the dollar.
This has led to a decline in economic activity across all sectors.
More than 500 SMEs received a deferral on credit payments in 2021
First Deputy Prime Minister Alihan Smailov has spoken about the situation with the provision of benefits for small and medium-sized businesses, reports the correspondent of MIA "Kazinform".
"According to the information of the Agency of the Republic of Kazakhstan on regulation and development of the financial market, in the current year, in accordance with the instruction of the Head of State of April 1, 2021, the order of the Chairman of the Agency of April 9, 2021 No. 127 "On approval of the Procedure for granting deferment of payments on loans of small and medium-sized businesses" was adopted," Alihan Smailov wrote in his response to the deputy's request.
He recalled that the procedure for granting a deferral of payments on loans stipulated that banks and organizations engaged in microfinance activities would be granted a deferral of payments on loans issued before April 1, 2021 to SMEs, including sole proprietorships, in the period from April 1 to June 30, 2021.
The deferment period was from 30 to 90 days, at the discretion of the SME.
The borrower's statement could have specified a different payment deferral period.
During the deferral period, the claims-filing work, the notice of the need to repay the overdue debt, as well as the collection of commissions and other payments by the creditor were suspended," the deputy prime minister noted.
In 2021, second-tier banks received requests to postpone payments on loans from 603 SME borrowers, of which 553 SME borrowers received a postponement in the amount of 9.7 billion tenge.
131 subjects of the MFO submitted applications for deferral, of which 95 were granted deferral for a total of 105.8 million tenge," concluded A. Smailov.
Pulmonologist Puryasev suggested that people with weak immunity can easily carry the "Okmiron" strain
The doctor suggested that people with weakened immune systems may be able to tolerate it better than those with a strong immune response
Pulmonologist Sergei Puryashev explained why the coronavirus strain “Okmiron” could be dangerous.
The cause lies in the conditions of the virus's emergence.
Scientists believe that the "ocmyron" originated in the body of an HIV-infected or immunocompromised person.
So, when he mutated, he didn't encounter any resistance from the immune system.
This makes him more aggressive.
Because of the lack of an immune response, it became very fast.
Apparently, he has these spike proteins, spines, maybe more than is necessary, their antibodies were not cut during the mutations, pulmonologist Sergei Puryashev comments.
The doctor suggested that people with a weakened immune system may be able to tolerate "okmiron" more easily than those with a strong immune response.
Turns out, a strong immune response to anything, any infection, is not always a good thing.
In such cases, the body can kill itself.
This is what happens with pneumococcal infections, when young people in their 30s die and old people in their 60s die from sneezing.
The immune response of the young man is insane, it is completely inappropriate: where you could only threaten with a finger, he beats like a cannon on sparrows, concluded Sergey Puryasev.
The doctor also reminded that the coronavirus has dangerous side effects and the most unpleasant of them is pneumonia.
Pneumonia can be bacterial or viral.
If the first is treated very successfully and quickly, in the second case it is often possible to buy only the symptoms - hope for the body.
The first sign of developing pneumonia will be the onset of body intoxication - this is a fever, weakness, malaise.
Then respiratory symptoms follow: difficulty breathing, a sore throat, and a cough.
Pain on one side or the other, as well as abdominal pain, can also be signs of a developing problem.
Meanwhile, in Russia, by the end of the year, it may be possible to start vaccinating the younger generation, aged 12 to 18.
A virologist, head of the genome engineering laboratory at MIPT, Pavel Volchkov, noted that this category is very actively affected by COVID-19.
The more contacts a teenager has, the more likely they are to go to school.
This is the most socially active layer, as well as kindergarten students, said Pavel Volchkov, a virologist and head of the genomic engineering laboratory at the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology (MIPT).

Immunologists have proposed a hypothesis as to why people with obesity are becoming victims of COVID-19
The authors studied the adipose tissue left over from bariatric surgery and found that fat cells, known as adipocytes, can be infected with the coronavirus.
Immune cells located in adipose tissue, macrophages, were also infected, and showed a strong inflammatory response.
Scientists also examined the adipose tissue of patients who died from COVID-19 and found coronavirus particles in the fat surrounding various organs.
It is known that HIV and influenza viruses can hide in adipose tissue, using it as a reservoir in an attempt to evade the immune system's response.
SARS-CoV-2 may be able to do this as well.
The biologist explained the causes of dementia
Candidate of Biological Sciences Semen Golosheikin named the causes of dementia and told about the ways of its prevention in an interview with the radio station Sputnik.
According to the World Health Organization, this disease affects more than 55 million people.
The syndrome manifests itself in a gradual loss of cognitive functions - over time, a person finds it difficult to navigate even in familiar surroundings.
Goloshekin noted that the most common causes of dementia are neurodegenerative disorders, head injuries, some infections, metabolic disorders, and a lack of certain vitamins.
Certain factors increase the risk of developing the disease.
This includes hypertension, diabetes, high cholesterol, obesity, depression, and alcoholism.
At the behavioural level, factors such as social isolation and lack of active cognitive engagement may play a role," he said.
Bad habits, such as smoking, excessive drinking, sleep disorders and a sedentary lifestyle, also play a role in the development of dementia.
Among the first signs of the expert was forgetfulness, an inability to concentrate and a decline in abstract thinking.
"There is a debate that hearing loss can be an early sign of Alzheimer's disease, or a risk factor for it," the biologist added.
To prevent the development of the disease, the World Health Organization recommends maintaining the necessary level of physical activity, training cognitive skills and abilities that require the involvement of memory and logic.
Previously, the professor of the Department of Neurology, Neurosurgery and Medical Genetics of the Federal State Educational Institution of Higher Education of the RANEPA named after
N.I. Pirogov, head of the department of cognitive disorders of the Federal Center for Brain and Neurotechnologies Anna Bogolepova spoke about the causes of memory problems.
Egypt returns nearly 30,000 illegally smuggled artifacts
In the last 10 years, the government of Cairo has managed to return about 30,000 artifacts to their homeland, which were illegally smuggled out of the country.
This was reported on Saturday, 11 December, on the Al-Hayat TV channel by the chief inspector of the department of returned antiquities of the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities of Egypt, Shaaban Abdel Gawad.
Since 2011, the Egyptian state has managed to recover 29,300 artefacts.
This year alone, the Museum of the Bible in Washington, D.C., has found 5,300 artifacts of ancient Egyptian civilization," he said.
Abdel Gaouad clarified that all the artifacts smuggled in have been registered in the archives.
The department is currently working to get them back to Egypt.
In particular, experts "track auctions worldwide and online sales" through foreign and Egyptian sites, as well as social networks.
The chief inspector said that the cultural treasures are restored when they are returned, and then they are put on display in museums.
One of the returned artifacts was a 20,000-year-old human skeleton discovered in Belgium, which is now part of the National Museum of Egyptian Civilization in Cairo.
In 2020, Egyptian authorities turned to Interpol to help track down a bust of Pharaoh Tutankhamun that was sold at an auction in London.
Christie's auction house held an auction on July 4, at which a bust over 3,000 years old was sold for $5.97 million (about 680 million rubles).
This caused discontent in Egypt.
The Egyptian side also claims that the artwork was illegally removed from the Karnak temple in Luxor in the 1970s.
The head of Tutankhamun, depicted as the sun god Amun, has been kept in a private collection and has not been put up for auction since 1985.
How the relic ended up in Europe is unknown.
Egypt has been actively seeking the repatriation of ancient artefacts illegally removed from the country at different times in recent years.
According to the authorities, 95% of the illegal antiquities are the result of black-market excavations.
"The Crimean Tatars are not taken into account" - and this is correct, because the Crimean Tatars (232,000) are an independent people (close to the Turks).
If you want to add, only 42 thousand people - so many Tatars (Kazakhs) live in the Crimea (see census).
The Crimean Tatars are a separate people, and the name of this people consists of two words!
They are united only by the Turkic language group.
FT: Credit Suisse wants access to staff's personal mobile devices
Credit Suisse requires its employees to provide the bank with access to their personal mobile devices, according to the Financial Times.
The problem is that in Europe and the US, Swiss banks do not provide their employees with corporate communications devices, instead offering a discount on the purchase of a mobile phone or smartphone from a partner telecom operator.
Under current rules, a bank can monitor information on corporate devices issued to its employees, as they are used to handle business matters with colleagues or clients.
The bank has the right to check mobile devices in extreme cases - for example, if an employee used it to conduct a meeting with a client that was not approved by Credit Suisse.
Now, however, after many staff have switched to remote working, the bank wants to extend this rule to all devices used to deal with work issues.
According to the newspaper, the bank's management has set a deadline by which employees can become familiar with the new rule.
Credit Suisse has not commented on the new request officially.

Part 4
The last year of Sergei Yesenin's life - 1925 - was fruitful in terms of creativity, but a heavy burden for the poet and his "ego."
He has long since parted with any literary associations, he is on his own, but he is known, in demand, sometimes strongly criticized by critics, even angrily, but the reading public is ready to carry him in their arms.
More than 60 poems were written in a year, many of which are masterpieces, the Persian motifs cycle was completed, the poem Anna Snegina was written, 8 books were published, and the collection Rus' Sovetskaya was published.
And the main success was at the end of June 25th, when the State Publishing House signed a contract with Yesenin for the publication of his works in three volumes.
No one of Sergei Alexandrovich's contemporary poets has been so honored, he is the first!
In addition, it promised very good money - according to the contract, the remuneration was 1000 rubles per month for 20 months (for example, the director of the plant received 300 rubles per month, the engineer - 200).
The funds were needed more than ever.
Yesenin married the granddaughter of Leo Tolstoy, Sofia Tolstoy, and had to arrange the family life, take care of sisters Katya and Sasha, and his mother.
It seemed that life was getting back on track, there was something to be happy about, but for him everything was coloured predominantly in dark tones, as if the nightmare from the poem "The Black Man" (written in November 1925 and published after the death of Yezenin) had come to life:
My friend, my friend,
I'm very, very sick.
I don't know where this pain came from.
Either the wind is whistling
Over an empty and deserted field,
That is, as in September,
Alcohol poisons the brain.
Many of his acquaintances noted that Yezenin had done badly, looked bad, and was clearly ill.
More and more, there are seizures and nervous breakdowns.
And the reason, perhaps, is not only alcoholism...
However, if such a diagnosis - alcoholism - was given to Sergei Alexandrovich, no reliable documents remain.
For example, in May 1923, when Yesenin was treated by his fourth wife, American Isadora Duncan, in a clinic in Paris, by Professor Peter Gannushkin (Yesenin would see him again two years later, in Moscow).
But there is plenty of evidence of the poet's drunkenness, scandals on this subject, arrests in the police - scattered over dozens of memoirs.
From the beginning of the 20s, the poet's terrible romance with the green snake developed rapidly.
In the summer of 1923, Yesenin briefly settled with his friend, the imazhinist Ivan Starzhev.
Surprisingly, despite his very good income, Yesenin never had his own accommodation in Moscow or St. Petersburg, he found himself in rented apartments, in hotels or with acquaintances.
The senior recalls:
"He only came to sleep, and most of the time in a drunken, deranged state.
One day, returning at four in the morning, Yesenin fell on the staircase...
Falling, he scratched his face and wheezed.
When he regained consciousness, he began to cough incessantly, spraying blood all over the sheets..."
And Yesenin himself, after a trip around Europe and the United States (in the States then there was a dry law, but Duncan brought with her a decent amount of alcohol), admitted:
"I saw nothing there except cabbages and streets...
I've already forgotten people at this point...
And he drank, of course...
And I drank because I was homesick."

Protex-Orient Duet Latex Econom 100x195
Promtex-Orient Duet Latex Econom – modern interpretation of the budget model in the premium-class line.
The base of the mattress is a block of independent double springs Duet.
A softer spring is inserted into the larger spring.
This allows the mattress to be evenly distributed.
On both sides of the mattress, a filler - artificial latex - was added.
It's an analogue of natural latex, but it's denser and more expensive.
The flexibility and elasticity of this material increases the comfort of the mattress.
The artificial latex is hypoallergenic, it doesn't absorb moisture or dust.
The mattress is suitable for a couple with a big weight difference (from 30 kilograms).
There is no wave effect, where the light partner rolls to the side of the heavy one, because of the "smart" springs.
A pleasant, soft-touch cover made of practical jacquard Sense is perforated with a layer of synthetic rubber.
Natural fabrics do not accumulate static electricity.
It may be possible to manufacture this mattress in a rolled-up (vacuum roll) version.
My son is almost 16 now and he's long since stopped wanting to beat people up.
All of his energy is focused on choosing what he's going to do for a living.
He's far more responsible than I was at his age or my husband, who had his fair share of run-ins with the law up until the wedding.
The father cares for his young daughter.
And he loved with a strange love, as Lermontov wrote.
Why did the girl cry during the exam, when she hadn't failed it?
Why he didn't tell his daughter it wasn't a school.
She'll have a tail.
What's the big deal?
I'll make it up to you.
Millions of students know this.
What is the point of this?
The Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes that Belarus uses migrants as "weapons" against the EU
The Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs considers that Belarus uses migrants as "weapons"
Deputy Foreign Minister of Poland Pavel Yablochinskiy expressed the opinion that the President of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko used refugees as "weapons" against the European Union and intends to return to such an "operation" next year.
The corresponding statement was made by the Deputy Foreign Minister in an interview with the Australian Financial Review newspaper.
According to Yablonsky, the sanctions against Belarus have temporarily "stopped Lukashenko," but he "is actively looking for new ways."
The Polish official also believes that now illegal migrants will be used as weapons "in many parts of the world."
As kp.ru reported earlier, the European Union has introduced the fifth package of sanctions against Belarus.
It affected 17 individuals and 11 organizations.
In Europe, they have stated their readiness to expand the restrictive measures against the republic, "if the situation in the country does not improve."
In response, Minsk introduced a food embargo on a wide range of goods from countries that previously decided to impose sanctions against Belarus.

"Not in a straw hat": when a velvet jacket turns a man into a laughing stock
In 2021, velvet blazers dominated the secular events.
Perhaps the first to announce his new fashion decision was Daniel Craig.
He was already at the premiere of the film "No Time to Die" in a velvet malachite jacket and a traditional "Bond" butterfly.
His example was followed by Prince William, who first wore a green velvet jacket that did not match the royal dress code to the Earthshot Prize award ceremony, and then chose a more classic option for the Royal Variety event in support of the Royal Variety Charity.
A couple of weeks ago, the trend caught up with Lionel Messi.
The footballer came to take the seventh "Golden Ball" in a velvet Dolce & Gabbana jacket.
By the way, his sons were dressed in the same.
AliExpress has already noted a growing demand for velvet men's jackets in Russia.
According to the service's analysts, their sales have increased by 1.4 times.
The most popular are warm velvet jackets with a lining and a tapered silhouette, the main colors are dark beige, burgundy, dark blue and, of course, black.
The average price of such models is from 3 to 6 thousand rubles. Men prefer to buy only jackets - they choose velvet suits less often.
They can be bought not only from online retailers.
Budget options are available at H&M, Mango, Next and Zara.
In the luxury segment, velvet jackets are represented in almost all brands - and Brioni, Paul Smith, Etro and Saint Laurent.
The most desired is the model of the Gucci brand, in which the brand ambassador Jared Leto appeared at one of the premieres of the film “House of Gucci”.
When choosing expensive branded jackets, you can be sure that the velvet is made of silk.
The special weaving technique produces a dense fabric with a fluffy outer texture and a smooth inner side.
More budget-friendly options are made from cotton or polyamide, but they last less.
Fashion expert Lamoda, Ilya Vakhoshkin, warns that in the case of the velvet jacket, the main thing is not its model or style, but appropriateness.
"Velvet requires evening light, so this jacket is ideal if you're going to a party or a formal event, explains Vakhoshkin. "It's also suitable for those occasions where the dress code is "Black Tie" or "Creative Black Tie".
Another important criterion is the status of the buyer.
“The man in a velvet jacket should first of all acquire a proper, well-to-do social circle, the authors of the Telegram channel about men’s fashion “Beautiful Brummell” believe. “The owners of velvet jackets, as a rule, belong to the caste of people who rarely buy tickets.
They are simply invited to attend themed parties, where the dress code is always specified.
Ilya Vakhoshkin suggests combining a velvet jacket with the same accessories: classic trousers with arrows, one-color shirts, silk ties, loafers with buttons, zippers.
Too simple and everyday things will look out of place.
Fashion experts at Brooks Brothers are convinced that it would be inappropriate for a junior employee to wear a velvet jacket to a corporate event, but if it's the "executive from among those who run the event, then yes, it's appropriate."
If a lower-ranking employee's goal is to move up the company's complex hierarchy or win financial bonuses, it's best not to wear a velvet jacket.
Management will definitely assess this with the phrase “not by Senke’s hat”, the editors of the Telegram channel about men’s fashion believe.
Very ambiguous feelings about the voice.
It's an unnatural sound, so forcefully drawn.
And it has nothing to do with the cute face of the young girl.
To be honest, I don't understand the admiration of those around me.
But from the bottom of my heart, I wish you all the best in life!
It's all about the money - alternative energy is well lobbied, which means it is paid for.
Billions of dollars.
Are they sad?
No, electricity prices have gone up.
Traditional energy is also out of the picture - both gas and oil and coal have been bought cheaper than they are sold.
Fuel is in high demand.
The penny drops.
And who was in the gap?
As usual, a regular customer.
Are the problems of the Indians affecting the sheriff?
Therefore, it is not correct to consider Western politicians as idiots who have "slept through" the energy crisis.
They did their job.
For a good price.
I didn't see one good-looking person in the pictures in the article.
Just average for the average passenger.
Maybe if such characters are so confident in their beauty that they're willing to show it to the whole train, they're probably not going to get away with it.
But only because of their mental disorder and ignorance, and not because of their appearance.

A slave who is unaware of his slavery and living in a silent, unconscious and speechless life of slavery is simply a slave.
Rab, who has a runny nose when he self-satisfiedly describes the pleasures of life as a slave and praises a kind and good master, is a tramp."
Immunologist says booster after 4-5 months will protect against omicron strain
Revaccination four to five months later may protect against the new coronavirus strain "Omicron".
Immunologist Nikolai Kryuchkov said that the vaccination after six months, taking into account the emergence of a new strain, is “a very long period”
"With the previous strains, such a period was normal, but now it is best to carry out the procedure after five months, and for people with chronic diseases - after four," the expert said, urging parallel with the vaccination campaign to carry out revaccination.
Kruchkov also noted that early revaccination provides a good titer of neutralizing antibodies.
"If a person has received two vaccinations and a booster, or if he has recovered and been vaccinated, or if he has been vaccinated and recovered, then he has received 'hybrid immunity'," the expert explained.
The G7 has warned Russia of 'massive consequences' if it invades Ukraine
The G7 countries (the United Kingdom, Germany, Italy, Canada, the United States, France and Japan) issued a statement following the meeting of foreign ministers in Liverpool.
It emphasizes that "Russian military aggression" against Ukraine "will have huge consequences and will cost Moscow dearly," but specific measures are not described in the document.
"We, the Foreign Ministers of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States of America and the High Representative of the European Union, are united in our condemnation of Russia's military build-up and aggressive rhetoric towards Ukraine," the statement said.
The ministers then call on Russia to "de-escalate, use diplomatic channels and comply with its international obligations on transparency of military activities," as President Biden said during a video call with Russian President Putin on December 7.
"We reaffirm our support for France and Germany's efforts in the Normandy format to achieve full implementation of the Minsk agreements to resolve the conflict in eastern Ukraine," the foreign ministers of the "Big Seven" also said.
Any use of force to change the borders is strictly prohibited by international law.
Russia should not doubt that further military aggression against Ukraine will have huge consequences and a serious price to pay in return," they warn.
We reaffirm our unwavering commitment to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, as well as the right of any sovereign state to determine its own future.
We welcome the restrained position of Ukraine.
We will intensify our cooperation on our common and comprehensive response," the statement added.
Earlier in the day, British Foreign Secretary Elizabeth Truss said that Russia would face "serious consequences" if it invaded Ukraine.
According to her, this meeting showed the "united voice of the "Big Seven"", which accounts for 50% of the world's GDP, and which very clearly stated that an invasion of Ukraine would have huge consequences for Russia.
Pfizer vaccine found to be 32 times less effective against omicron strain
The effectiveness of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine against the omicron strain of the coronavirus is 32 times lower than that of other strains of the disease.
The conclusion was reached by scientists from the University of Hong Kong and the Chinese University of Hong Kong, South China Morning Post (SCMP) reports.
The vaccine was deemed less effective based on a study of antiviral activity in people who received two doses of the COVID-19 vaccine.
"We see that most people have a high level of antiviral activity against the original Sars-CoV-2 strain, but this ability has been significantly reduced against the omicron variant," Professor Malik Peiris said.
At the same time, scientists emphasized that vaccination remains the most reliable way to protect against the severe course of the disease in the event of a coronavirus infection.
Earlier, scientists from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine predicted the development of a coronavirus pandemic taking into account the influence of the omicron strain.
The authors of the study concluded that the omicron strain could cause a new wave of circulation of the virus and an increase in mortality if additional measures are not taken.
Ukraine’s Defense Ministry accuses Germany of blocking NATO weapons supplies to Kiev
Ukraine's Defense Minister Alexey Reznikov accused the former German Chancellor Angela Merkel's government of blocking the purchase of lethal weapons by Kiev within NATO.
In an interview with the Financial Times on December 12, Reznikov recalled that in the previous month, Germany vetoed the purchase of anti-sniper systems and assault rifles for the destruction of drones by Ukraine.
At the same time, it is noted that later, Berlin softened its position on assault rifles, recognizing them as lethal weapons.
According to the defense minister, Kiev intends to acquire the aforementioned weapons within the framework of bilateral agreements with allies.
In particular, this refers to the United States, the United Kingdom, Lithuania and France.
Meanwhile, the FT notes that the position of the new German government under Chancellor Olaf Scholz on allowing arms shipments to Ukraine remains unclear.
Earlier on Sunday, the Ukrainian ambassador to Germany, Andriy Melnyk, expressed the opinion that Kiev should not expect Berlin to supply weapons to Chancellor Scholz.
According to him, the previous German leadership explained its refusal to provide weapons by the risk of military escalation of the conflict in Donbass, despite the "occupation of Russia" of part of the Ukrainian territory.
The same "illogical" position, the diplomat is sure, Germany will maintain under the new chancellor.
In August, Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky said that Kiev expects assistance from Berlin in equipping the navy.
In Ukraine, they expect that Germany "will be a partner of Ukraine in the technical sense," the president added.
It was also noted that in the spring of this year, the co-chair of the Green Party of Germany, Robert Habeck, visited the republic, where he spoke in favor of the sale of defensive weapons to Kiev.

Mercedes has lodged a protest against the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix result
The German Mercedes team, whose driver Lewis Hamilton finished second behind Red Bull's Max Verstappen at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, has filed a protest against the final result of the race, the Formula 1 press service reports.
Mercedes believes that the rules 48.12 and 48.8 of the Formula 1 were violated during the race.
In the first case, the German team challenges the judges' decision to return the round-track drivers to the same lap as the leaders.
According to the second, Ferstappen overtook Hamilton in the allowed "restart" zone.
We should add that the result of the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, according to which Verstappen overtook Hamilton by 2.256 seconds and won the Formula 1 world championship, is preliminary, since the protests of Mercedes are not known
G7 warns Russia of responsibility for invasion of Ukraine
G7 foreign ministers warned of "serious consequences" for Russia if it continued its military aggression against Ukraine, according to a joint statement.
The participants of the meeting also noted that they condemn the strengthening of the Russian armed forces on the borders of the country.
"Russia should have no doubt that further military aggression against Ukraine will have serious consequences and serious costs," the UK government's website said in a statement.
G7 ministers and the EU's chief diplomat said they were "united in their condemnation of Russia's military build-up and aggressive rhetoric towards Ukraine."
British Foreign Secretary Elizabeth Truss warned of "significant consequences" for Russia in the event of an invasion of Ukraine at a press conference in Liverpool.
We have made it clear that any invasion would have significant consequences...
The G7 wants Russia to abandon its aggression against Ukraine," she said (quoted by TASS).
Earlier, at the summit in Liverpool, G7 foreign ministers agreed that to resolve the crisis over the buildup of Russian troops on the border with Ukraine, the parties need to return to the negotiating table.
The talks were in the "Normandy format".
The North Atlantic Alliance also took part in the dialogue on Ukraine in the “Normandy format”.
Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said that by calling for Russia and Ukraine to return to the negotiating table, the G7 countries "signed up to their inability to take responsibility for their own mistakes".

Ways to return stolen money through online stores have been revealed
There are several ways to get your money back from online stores that have been stolen, and not become a victim of fraud in the future.
Experts in information security revealed their findings in an interview with RBC.
For example, to reduce the risk of large losses in the event of a data breach of a bank card, it is recommended to keep the main funds on the card or bank account that are not used for online shopping.
Some of the savings can be put into a savings account and withdrawn as needed.
Experts also recommend setting up a separate card for online purchases.
If the money was stolen while shopping at a store that doesn't use 3D Secure, you can initiate a chargeback.
"In accordance with the rules established by payment systems, for unauthorized transactions carried out without the use of 3D Secure, the responsibility lies with the participant in the payment chain who does not use the service," a representative of Promsvyazbank clarified.
An expert from the international payment provider Ecommpay, Arthur Zaremba, stressed that the buyer has the right to file a complaint with the bank to dispute the fraudulent transaction no later than 120 days after the purchase.
In addition, if the perpetrator used the card on online resources that did not require two-factor authentication, the transaction can be disputed and the money returned.
It is noted that in some cases, online stores themselves return the money to the customer if the order has not yet been shipped.
On November 19, Public Chamber member Ekaterina Mizulina reported that in 2021 alone, 11,000 requests were received for various cases of fraud: from the sale of fake documents to the theft of personal data.
According to her, an effective solution in the current circumstances could be the creation of a single window for complaints against online fraudsters.
Scholz arrives in Poland to discuss Nord Stream 2 and EU legislation
Newly-elected German Chancellor Olaf Scholz arrived in Warsaw for talks on the migrant crisis at the border with Belarus, the independence of the judiciary in Poland, the buildup of Russian troops near Ukraine and the situation with the Russian Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline.
While Scholz stated his desire to preserve good relations between Germany and Poland for many years, the leaders of the two countries expressed clear expectations of each other.
Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said he would urge Scholz to oppose Nord Stream 2, a pipeline that is supposed to deliver Russian gas to Germany bypassing Ukraine.
According to Morawiecki, Russia can use the gas pipeline against Europe as a means of political pressure.
Germany, in turn, supported Poland's efforts to stem the flow of migrants trying to enter the country from Belarus.
Berlin said it would help Warsaw and Brussels to resolve this crisis.
However, the Polish judicial system remains one of the reasons for disagreement.
The European Court of Justice has fined Poland, finding that the judicial reforms carried out by the right-wing Law and Justice party violate EU law.
Poland refused to pay the fine and its highest court ruled that national law takes precedence over EU rules.
The new German government, sworn in on Wednesday, despite demands from Poland and the United States, has made no public commitment to stop the Nord Stream 2 pipeline in the event of a Russian invasion of Ukraine.
U.S. officials have told congressional members they have reached an understanding with Germany to halt the pipeline if Russia invades Ukraine, a senior U.S. congressional official said Tuesday.
German officials have not confirmed the reports, but Scholz warned on Wednesday of the consequences if Russia violates Ukraine's border, and the G7 representatives confirmed this position on Sunday.
Dmitri, look more closely.
The view from the window is the same, the size of the window hasn't changed.

In fact, those who are not familiar with the initial planning are doubtful.
But I know these apartments very well and I can see how they've been reconfigured.
May they be well.
It always surprises me when they write about the means to clean the sink, the toilet, the skirting boards, the taps.
You wash them once a year at Passover, what do you do, you have to wash them.
Just don't let it get dirty.
Minzifry wants to give writers residencies
The state will transfer to the future Fund for the Support of Russian Writers federal property left in inheritance from the Union of Writers of the USSR and the Literary Fund of the USSR.
Residencies for writers will be created on its basis, the Ministry of Digital Transformation reported to the “Parliamentary Gazette”, which will become the founder of the foundation.

The draft law stipulates that the Foundation is to be created in order to promote literary activity by creating the necessary conditions for the creative work of writers.
“The creation of conditions for creative activity is understood to mean the creation of writer’s residences in different regions of Russia on the basis of the transferred property, in which the conditions for creativity would be comfortable,” the Ministry of Digital Development, Communications, and Mass Media explained to us.

Doctors warn of risks of long-term use of blood thinners after COVID-19 and before vaccination
Doctors Irina Yartseva and Sergey Tokarev warned of the dangers of uncontrolled use of blood thinners after contracting the coronavirus infection COVID-19 and before vaccination against the coronavirus.
A physician-therapist, immunologist, Irina Yartseva, said that self-prevention of the possible formation of blood clots after COVID-19 can provoke a stroke.
Yarzeva explained that anti-coagulants are not for everyone, only if the patient has been hospitalized, has been in a hospital, and has complications.
The doctor prescribes anti-coagulants (blood-thinning drugs that prevent excessive formation of clots) according to indications.
She said that now there is a nightmare - everyone is drinking anti-coagulants for a long time and getting complications in the form of hemorrhagic strokes (bleeding in the brain).
The chief prophylactologist of the UrOFO, the scientific director of the Society of Specialists in Preventive Medicine, Doctor of Medical Sciences, Sergei Tokarev, in an interview with URA.RU, told that Russians now often use anticoagulants without a prescription and before the vaccination against the coronavirus infection.
According to Dr. Tokarev, citizens trust dubious advice on the Internet and begin to self-medicate.
There are citizens who, a week before vaccination, start taking anti-coagulants of their own accord.
And during the preliminary examination before vaccination, doctors notice blood oozing.
He stressed that it is extremely dangerous to take any medication without ascertaining the cause of any symptoms.

The plumber who found the money in the church wall will be paid $20,000
The plumber who found the money in a church wall in the U.S. state of Texas will be paid a reward.
The information was released in a press release by Crime Stoppers of Houston.
The incident took place at a large evangelical church in Lakewood, where pastor Joel Osteen promises prosperity and success to the faithful.
In November 2021, plumber Justin Cowley was repairing one of the church's toilets and found thousands of bags of cash and checks under the insulation.
He gave the find to the church and, according to him, never received a thank you from Austin.
"I wanted to hear him say, "You know, Justin, you did the right thing.
We understand what you did and what you could have done," KPRC-TV quoted him as saying.
Apparently, the find is related to a robbery that took place at Lakewood Church seven years ago.
At the time, about $200,000 in cash and $400,000 in checks were missing from the church's safe.
The money was insured, so the church did not suffer any losses.
However, a reward of $25,000 was offered for information about the perpetrators.
Justin Coyle couldn't claim the sum as the award had already expired.
Despite this, the non-profit Crime Stoppers of Houston, which had previously offered a $5,000 reward and later received another $20,000 in donations from Lakewood Church, decided to reward the plumber's honesty.
He will receive $20,000.
Earlier, it was reported that police questioned pastor Joel Osteen about money found in the church's wall.
Tanya, her words, her actions - that's what defines her as a real person.

This is reported by CNN Brasil.
Citizens who have contraindications to vaccination are no longer required to present a vaccination certificate.
Also included in the list of exceptions are those arriving from countries where it has been proven that there is no vaccine.
"The situation is even more serious if we consider that Brazil is a popular tourist destination for New Year's, pre-carnival and carnival parties, as well as other events, which means an increase in tourist traffic," Barroso noted.
Earlier, Brazilian authorities required unvaccinated coronavirus patients to observe a five-day quarantine.
The full protection scheme against COVID-19 has been revealed
A virologist, doctor of medical sciences, Honored Scientist of the Russian Federation Anatoly Altstein in an interview with Ura.ru revealed the scheme of complete protection from the coronavirus infection.
He said this could be achieved by the administration of an injection and the use of a nasal vaccine.
When given intravenously, large amounts of immunoglobulin A are formed. This does not occur when the vaccine is injected.
Immunoglobulins A protect the mucous membrane, so the virus cannot enter the body.
And inside, after vaccination, we produce the most immunoglobulins G (antibodies).
And if you get both vaccines, you will get a lot of antibodies A and G. But there is no decision on double vaccination," the doctor explained.
The head of the UrO prophylactologist, Doctor of Medical Sciences Sergei Tokarev, in turn, stated that the main advantage of using nasal vaccination in combination with an injection is the ability to stop being a carrier of COVID-19.
He added that this would help because then the body's defenses would presumably be at their maximum.
Earlier, the Minister of Health of Nizhny Novgorod Region David Melik-Guseynov stated that the new wave of the COVID-19 pandemic would lead to the spread of the new coronavirus infection among children.
According to him, such a picture is observed in other countries where the next wave of the pandemic arrived earlier.
Irina, hmm...
I talked to a mare (she died a long time ago) like this - if you're willing to give up the warmth of your home, the feeding trough, the caresses, the love and the games, then go ahead.
But the pesel was trained and generally smart.
I chose my society and went home.
The video shows a method that works 90% of the time.
It was not taken from the ceiling, believe me.
I've stopped many owners from running after their dogs, even though they said, "There are 200,000 running away," and I've taken them by the hand and led them the other way.
In the end, "200 thousand" chose the owner, not the dog that ran away somewhere.
Mass protests against vaccination continue in Europe
More than forty thousand demonstrators took to the streets in the Austrian capital, Vienna.
They expressed dissatisfaction with the restrictions and the authorities' plans to make vaccination against COVID-19 compulsory.
From February next year, non-vaccinated people will have to pay a fine of 3,600 euros.
The Spanish, angered by the government's health policy, held a peaceful march in Madrid.
Some held placards with the message "This is a fake pandemic", "I won't get vaccinated".
A major protest against the sanitary passports took place in Barcelona, the capital of Catalonia.
In the autonomous community, a Covid certificate is mandatory for access to bars, restaurants, gyms, nursing homes and nightclubs.
The decision to introduce sanitary passports was taken in the wake of an increase in the number of coronavirus cases.
More than a thousand protesters in Luxembourg protested against the tightening of restrictions and QR codes.
The action started peacefully, but then turned into clashes with the police.
A group of protesters began throwing stones at police.
In response, law enforcement officers used water cannons.
Nikolay S. even in Wikipedia there is no consensus on this matter.
Kashevarova-Rudneva is also listed as “the first Russian doctor, doctor of medicine”, probably because she started studying earlier.
Let's just not argue, I think they both deserve that title.
Only one of them agrees with Zakharova: the Americans brought nothing but death and plunder to any country where they appeared.

WHO has detected 'Omicron' in more than 60 countries
The World Health Organization (WHO) said the new strain of coronavirus, called Omicron, has been detected in 63 countries.
Several experts have already said that the spread of the new strain could have catastrophic consequences.
The rate of spread of the strain was reported by the WHO.
As of 9 December, the strain has been detected in 63 countries, in all six WHO regions.
This is despite the fact that it has only been actively spreading since the end of November.
The WHO also expressed concern about the rapid spread of the new variant of the coronavirus.
WHO experts expressed concern that the new strain, according to preliminary data, may surpass the spread of the "delta" strain, the Indian variant of the coronavirus, which is currently leading in all countries without exception.
Earlier, World Health Organization (WHO) Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that the Omicron strain can have a significant impact on the course of the coronavirus pandemic.
The same conclusion was reached in the United Kingdom as well.
Experts at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) believe that "Omicron" will displace "Delta" in the coming months.
And the number of cases in the UK alone will be around 1 million. This is despite the fact that officially, at the moment, there are a few hundred people in the UK with Omicron, and according to estimates, up to 10,000.
British experts predict tens of thousands of deaths from the Omicron strain, and more than 2,000 people will be admitted to hospital every day at its peak.
The British health service will not be able to cope with this.
The situation is complicated by the fact that according to the latest studies, the effectiveness of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine against the "Omicron" strain is 32 times lower than that of other types of disease.
How the Russian Sputnik V will react to the “omicron” remains unknown - this will become clear in the next few weeks.
The Gamaleya Center has only just begun testing the Russian vaccine on the Omicron strain.

Curious Belka, you're right, online communication is very different, it's easy and casual, and when you meet in person, there's nothing to say.

Israel's Prime Minister Bennett announced the start of vaccinations in schools
Israel's Ministry of Health will begin an emergency vaccination program on Sunday.
Since the morning of December 12, vaccination against coronavirus has been carried out in schools throughout Israel.

$135 billion went to apps - Hi-Tech
In 2021, app user spending grew by 25% globally, and downloads grew by 8%.
The most popular video services in the world turned out to be various video services.
The most popular video editor was CapCut, and the most money was spent on YouTube.
And the number of app downloads and user spending showed a significant increase over the period from January to November 2021.
The number of downloads increased by 8%, reaching 140 billion. The users' spending in apps has also increased by 25%, to a record $135 billion.
Such data was published by the analytical company App Annie, which published a report on the mobile app market in 2021.
In 2021, the global economy emerged from lockdown and began a post-pandemic recovery.
"Will this 'return to physical' growth of the app economy slow down? Absolutely not," the authors of the report say.
India was the leader in the number of app downloads, accounting for about 20% of all downloads.
The United States (9%) and Brazil (8%) follow.
Gadget users on iOS spent more than Android users: 65% of all app spending was on iOS.
Among the applications, CapCut, a video editor, took first place in terms of the number of downloads in 2021.
It is followed by two Indian apps - video service MX TakaTak and the online shopping app Meesho.
Telegram also ranks in the top 10 for the number of downloads.
In general, judging by the number of downloads, VPN services are popular among users (two of them are in the top 10 - VPN Master and NightOwl VPN) and services related to the creation and broadcasting of videos (in addition to CapCut and MX TakaTak, two more such services are in the top 10 - Moj and SnackVideo).
"Users spent the most on apps for live streaming and online streaming," the authors of the report noted.
YouTube is leading the pack, with TikTok, Disney+ and HBO Max video streaming services, and the Japanese manga subscription service Piccoma all in the top five.
Telegram, Instagram, Zoom and TikTok occupy the first places in the number of monthly active users, and the mobile version of Microsoft Office closes the top-5.
In Russia, the leader in the number of downloads per year was the shopping app AliExpress.
Following it is the service Zenly, which shows the location of friends, and the same CapCut.
Other apps in the top 10 include: online karaoke app StarMaker, online clothing retailer Shein, the Maps for Minecraft PE app, the online taxi booking service DiDi, the Pure Tuber YouTube client, the Dixie retail app, and the online scooter store Samokat.
People around the world have adapted to the pandemic through the shift to mobile life, which is one of the big takeaways.
The industries that have seen the greatest success have been those that have helped people connect both virtually and in person," App Annie's head of marketing research, Lexi Sido, commented on the report's findings.
The mobile games sector generated $90 billion in 2021, with the leaders in downloads being casual and hypercasual games, which have little or no storyline, and minimal video design.
The top three most popular games in the world are Count Masters, Project Makeover and Bridge Race.
DOP 2: Delete One Part, Going Balls and Phone Case DIY are the top games in Russia.
Previously, App Annie released its forecast for 2022.
Among the major trends for next year, the company's analysts named the growth of TikTok users to 1.5 billion, the popularity of Generation Z financial apps, such as the Robinhood investment app, and the further increase in the popularity of metaverse mobile games.

Russians warned about new scam
The perpetrators began to look for new tricks in the video messages.
Izvestia writes about this with reference to experts.
According to the director of products at Ivideon, Zaur Abutaliyev, the main danger associated with the spread of video communication tools is deepfakes.
In this case, the scammers create a fake video based on real recordings of the victim.
This allows the neural network to accurately reproduce the characteristics of a person's behavior.
Abutaliyev added that using deepfake, the attackers can call the victim's acquaintances via video call or create a video featuring a copy of the person to send out for blackmail.
"Such fakes can easily provoke bullying, as a skilled perpetrator can put people into embarrassing, dangerous or compromising pseudo-scenarios," the expert said.
Varonis lead systems engineer Alexander Vetkol in turn noted that psychologically, people are more likely to trust others when they see them.
He stressed that this could create specific risks in the event of video-based technologies.
David, I'll add.
In what I wrote above, I focused on the fact that I bought all of this in a small town where the local mentality didn't allow for a lot of makeup and short skirts, stockings and socks.
It's a small town, but the store had that item.
In big cities and in Muslim countries, women painted their faces and showed their legs.
This is how it is in Dushanbe, it is a big city, the capital of the republic.
There are a lot of trends, but there is no such makeup.
Five actions to help prevent diabetes
High blood sugar levels are one of the most common problems in the world.
However, some do not take it seriously and it is a mistake.
Diabetes can eventually lead to serious complications and even death.
Preventive measures play a major role in preventing the formation of diseases.
For example, doctors recommend changing the diet - reducing the amount of various drinks and switching to plain water has a positive effect on metabolism.
Sugary foods raise blood sugar levels to dangerous levels when eaten in excess.
Therefore, the first step on the path to a healthy lifestyle is to stop buying sweets and keep them at home.
The disease is not only affected by improper nutrition, but also by habits.
To reduce the risk of diabetes, it is necessary to move a lot.
Experts recommend following a low-carb diet.
Such a diet will not only help you lose weight, but will also protect you from sudden fluctuations in sugar levels.
To protect against diabetes, you need to eat a lot of fiber.
Dietary fiber fills the stomach and thus helps to create a feeling of fullness, the secretion of digestive juices, and the increased absorption of food.

Doctor Pavlova spoke about the “weekend migraine” of workaholics
Several factors can contribute to worsening symptoms over the weekend
The reason for the worsening of the patient’s condition after working days is often a “migraine of the weekend”, explained the well-known endocrinologist, candidate of medical sciences, senior researcher at the Faculty of Fundamental Medicine of Moscow State University, the scientific director of the System Medicine Clinic, Zuhra Pavlova in her Telegram channel.
She says that it is especially common for workaholics to experience headaches, fatigue, and weakness on weekends.
Doctor Pavlova noted that in addition to the accumulated fatigue of the past week, there are many objective reasons for the negative reaction of the body to changes in conditions.
On the weekend, our lives are completely changed.
"We sleep a lot, all day we lie on the couch, probably we eat more and drink less - the doctor argued. "Because of the lack of coffee, there is a small break.
Because of overeating and lack of water - heaviness and brokenness."
The late rise also plays a role.
For example, if you get up three hours later than usual, you will experience a reaction called jet lag.
It affects travelers who cross multiple time zones.
To determine which of the factors plays a decisive role in worsening one’s health, Pavlova recommended tracking what changes the most on weekends.

South African scientists say Pfizer vaccine against Omicron is low-efficacy
South Africa says Pfizer vaccine against Omicron is ineffective
South African scientists have conducted a study and reported low efficacy of the Pfizer vaccine against the omicron strain of the coronavirus.
According to estimates, it (the level of neutralization of "omicron") corresponds to (the level of) vaccine efficacy of 22.5% against symptomatic infection, which... casts doubt on the vaccine's ability to protect against infection, the text of the study published on the MedRxiv portal says.
At the same time, experts clarified that the drug can save from a severe course of the disease.
Earlier, the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine predicted that the omicron strain of coronavirus could cause a new wave of the pandemic in the UK with more frequent hospitalizations than a year ago.
How much hidden sugar is in common foods?
Sugar is not a good source of nutrients.
Excess of it in the diet can lead to type 2 diabetes, as well as cardiovascular and cancer diseases.
Consumers should be aware that a hidden sugar may be listed under an unfamiliar word in a product's ingredient list - an ingredient similar to sugar in terms of calories, composition and glycemic index.
The label may contain several dozen names, essentially referring to sugar.
Some of the most common and frequently encountered names are glucose and fructose.
Other sugars may include dextrose (sugar derived from corn), levulose (fruit sugar), molasses (blackstrap), agave nectar, and the like.
These are all simple carbohydrates, which belong to the monosaccharides and disaccharides, and they can be found not only in confectionery, but also in ketchup, doctor's sausage, bread, and so on.
As stated by Roskandal, the most effective way to reduce sugar consumption is to eat whole and unprocessed foods, as well as to pay attention to the labels and the many different names for sugar.
Different types of sugar have different tastes, but no matter what the ingredient is called in a product - syrup or nectar, processed or unprocessed, brown or white - it is still sugar.
It is not easy to count the exact amount of sugar, as it is necessary to take into account not only the amount of sugar indicated by the manufacturer on the packaging, but also the fact that vegetables, fruits and other things contain a certain amount of sugar.
As a result, the total amount of sugar may be significantly higher than indicated on the label.
German Chancellor Scholz: Gas will lose importance for Germany in 25 years
Germany's new Chancellor Olaf Scholz said that gas imports are losing importance for Germany as the country continues its transition to a decarbonized economy.
According to him, Germany plans to completely abandon gas, oil and coal by 2045, becoming a climate-neutral country.
"In 25 years, the world will be such that the question of transporting gas to Germany and Europe will play a different role," the chancellor said.
Scholz noted that Germany continues to be committed to transporting Russian natural gas and in the future, as the resource is currently of great importance for the energy transition.
He recalled that Germany and the United States made a statement in which Berlin's support for Ukraine's energy transformation was recorded.
Earlier, German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said that the certification process for the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline is ongoing.
According to the minister, during the coalition negotiations and the discussion of the coalition agreement, it was stated that European law in the field of energy should be applied to energy projects.
The diplomat also noted that the pipeline "does not meet the requirements" of the European Union.

Hackers break into Twitter account of Indian PM
Hackers have breached the Twitter account of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
The attackers managed to post a fake message.
It was reported that India allegedly recognized bitcoin as a legal payment method, and that the country had already purchased cryptocurrency.
Modi's office has asked him to ignore the new messages.
The Prime Minister's spokesman said Twitter reacted quickly, reinstating the account.
The Indian Prime Minister's page was hacked in 2020 and urged people to donate to the fund using cryptocurrency.
A referendum in New Caledonia saw a majority vote against independence
In New Caledonia, the third referendum, held on 12 December, ended with the same result as the previous two.
According to the first partial results announced on Sunday, December 12, at noon, the majority of New Caledonians voted in the referendum against the independence of their territory.
At the same time, the level of participation in this third vote was significantly lower than in the previous two.
According to preliminary results published by local authorities, 3.51% (2,755) voted in favour of New Caledonia's independence from France, while 96.49% (75,762) voted against.
Turnout was 43.90%, with more than 80,000 New Caledonians voting in the election.
As France-Presse comments on these interim results, "the outcome of these elections left no room for doubt" as independence supporters urged voters not to vote.
As initiators of the referendum, they opposed its holding on December 12, believing that the new outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic on the archipelago prevented a full-fledged and "honest" election campaign.
Thus, this abstention opened the way to the third victory of the supporters of French New Caledonia, after the referendums held in November 2018 and October 2020.
In 2018, 56.7% of residents voted against independence, in 2020 - 53.3%.
The separatists said they would not recognise the results of the latest vote and would challenge them at the United Nations.
As reported on Sunday, December 12, at the Elysée Palace, French President Emmanuel Macron is due to address the results of this referendum.
The issue of New Caledonia's independence has largely revived the presidential campaign in France in recent weeks.
Several presidential candidates have argued that the territory should remain in France, as it is "the last outpost of the European Union in the Pacific".
"New Caledonia must remain French," repeatedly reiterated Eric Zemmour.
The Republican candidate, Valerie Pecresse, who published a column in Le Figaro in late October urging the Caledonians to remain French, made a similar statement.
For his part, Emmanuel Macron announced in May 2018 that he would not take the position, "because it is not his responsibility."
However, the president added: "France would be less beautiful without New Caledonia."
Prime Minister Jean Castex, for his part, expressed "a strong desire for the Caledonian choice to be the French choice."

WSJ readers criticize Russia-U.S. relations piece
Readers of The Wall Street Journal have criticized an article by Professor Christopher Hartwell, in which he described his vision of relations between Russia and the United States.
The author expressed concern that the West is allegedly sacrificing Ukraine to Russia.
In his article, he convinces readers of the danger that comes from Moscow and made a number of derogatory remarks about Russian President Vladimir Putin.
At the end, Hartwell called on the West to "stand together as one front against Russia."
WSJ readers expressed their disagreement with the professor's position.
"There is a lot of false information in this article," one of the readers quoted RIA Novosti as saying.
"Europe is not ours to lose, and Ukraine is not our land.
The United States and NATO allies will never wage a nuclear war with Russia over Ukraine," another noted.

An earthquake of magnitude 5.2 occurred in the area of the Kuril Islands
An earthquake of magnitude 5.2 occurred near the Shikotan island.
It is noted that the epicenter of the earthquake was located 231.8 km northeast of the city of Severo-Kurilsk.
The focus was at a depth of 92.5 km.
Earlier, seismologists recorded an earthquake of magnitude 7.5 in Peru, in which ten people were injured.

Ukraine will start producing new generation of air-to-air missiles
The new Ukrainian-Turkish plant will start to create the ANKA-type reactive unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).
On December 11, an independent adviser to the head of the Ukrainian president’s office, Aleksey Arestovich, reported this.
That is, they are capable of acting against air targets, against other drones.
Even against piloted aircraft.
They will have Ukrainian engines and the rest of the Turkish avionics: the body and so on," Dialog.ua quotes him.
Commenting on the main features of the ANKA devices, Arestovich said that they are jet, not piston UAVs.
According to him, this new generation of drones after Bayraktar surpasses it in all respects.
The first batch of UAVs should be produced by the plant at the end of the next year, Arestovich concluded.
The ANKA aircraft was created by the Turkish Aerospace Agency in February 2014.
The development of the drone was carried out by the Turkish authorities in cooperation with a number of private companies since 2010.
The day before, the Ukrainian General Staff classified data on the use of Bayraktar drones and Javelin missile systems during military operations of the combined forces in Donbas.
On December 6, President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky reported that the construction of a plant for the manufacture of modern military unmanned aerial vehicles had begun in the country.
According to him, Ukraine intends to use drones.
On September 29, the Bayraktar Defense Company and the Ukrainian Defense Ministry signed an agreement to build a center in Kiev region, where personnel training, as well as tests and maintenance of Turkish Bayraktar UAVs will be conducted.
The press service of the office of the Ukrainian leader called the memorandum “a big real step forward”.
Two lions escaped from a container at the airport
Lions have escaped from Changi Airport in Singapore.
This was reported by The Straits Times.
The two predators managed to escape from a container with seven lions that had arrived on one of the planes.
The publication notes that it remains unknown from which country they were brought to Singapore, and where they were headed.
One of the escaped lions has made itself at home on the roof of a container.
They couldn't get away from him because of the protective netting that was set up nearby.
The confrontation ended after the arrival of staff from the Mandai Wildlife Group, which manages all of Singapore's zoos.
They have immobilized the lions with tranquilizer darts and plan to transport them to a quarantine facility.
Earlier it was reported that in the capital of Cambodia, Phnom Penh, a lion ran away from its owner and wandered the streets of the city.
On the same day, the animal voluntarily returned home, and no one was hurt.
Experts warn of cancer risk from B9 vitamin
Research suggests that an excess of vitamin B9, also known as folic acid, can lead to cancer.
The Daily Express has warned of this.
Experts say there is strong evidence that people who are not deficient in folic acid are less likely to develop certain types of cancer, particularly colorectal cancer.
However, exceeding the necessary dose in the opposite direction promotes the growth of cancer cells.
University of Alabama Birmingham professor of nutrition Beth Kitchin recommends monitoring the amount of folic acid consumed throughout the day.
The optimal dose is 400 micrograms per day.
Cancer risk increases only if you significantly deviate from this figure in either direction.
Kitchin recommends not taking B9 tablets without a doctor's recommendation, and to check the dosage and avoid milkshakes and other foods that contain folic acid.
Earlier, nutrition consultant Rachel Fine called folate a substance that slows aging.
Because it is, among other things, contained in avocado, Fine recommended that men over 50 eat this fruit more often.
In the UK, up to 75,000 people could die from the Omicron strain by April
British scientists have warned that up to 75,000 people could die in England in the next five months due to the spread of the omicron strain of coronavirus, unless restrictions are tightened in the winter.
The Guardian reported this with reference to a study by experts from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), TASS reports.
According to the most optimistic forecast of experts who are part of the Emergency Situation Advisory Group at the British Ministry of the Cabinet, by April 2022, the country will record at least 25,000 deaths from the omicron strain, and about 175,000 patients will be hospitalized.
At the peak of the outbreak, hospitals will be admitting more than 2,000 infected people every day.
"Serious measures to combat the coronavirus may be required to avoid the National Health Service being overwhelmed if the Omicron strain turns out to be more contagious than the Delta variant and existing vaccines cannot prevent infection," said mathematician Rosanna Barnard of the LSHTM.
Previously, the UK Health Security Agency said that if the rate of spread of the omicron strain remained at its current level, there would be around 1 million cases of infection by the end of the year.
By mid-December, the omicron strain could become dominant in the UK.
There are currently 1,898 cases of the Omicron strain of coronavirus in the UK, with 633 confirmed in the last 24 hours.
At the same time, on December 9, the head of the British Ministry of Health, Sajid Javid, stated that in reality, this figure could already reach 10,000 cases.
I was going to write a clever comment, but I got to this point:

Superyacht inquiries have grown by a quarter worldwide
Superyacht construction this year and orders for next year are breaking world records despite calls to cut carbon emissions and combat climate change.
The world fleet of yachts has 1200 units, which is 25% more than last year.
In the era of climate change mitigation, it is hard to imagine that the number of people willing and able to pay £50 million or more for a floating fortress will not dwindle, writes The Guardian.
However, there are more and more of them.
This year, 25% more ships were ordered than in the previous year.
Brokers say there has not been such a frenzy in the market for 20 years.
The first reason is that many who can afford a yacht are afraid of contracting the disease on land and prefer to stay away from the pandemic on their own vessel.
The second reason is also related to the coronavirus.
Previously, all these people would go to the office and meet with business partners face-to-face, but now the vast majority of them work remotely and conduct negotiations by phone.
Broker Will Christie told the paper that shipyards are taking orders for new yachts for 2025 and beyond.
This means that customers are willing to pay more if their yacht is ready at least a year or two earlier.
"People just want freedom, and the super-rich can afford it," he says.
In western society, many people criticize this behaviour of the rich and call it decadent.
The rich, say sociologists, don't want to understand that in the age of space travel, life on yachts or flying your own plane causes public irritation because the elite don't want to share the blame for climate change with the rest of humanity.
Economists are urging governments to act and are proposing new taxes and rules for the super-rich, even though they understand that with such mobility of money, it will be very difficult to implement.
However, the number of super yachts ordered is impressive, but so are their characteristics.
Of the 1,200 ships, 27 have a length of the stern above 100 meters.
The Norwegian billionaire Rekke is building the 183-meter yacht REV Ocean.
After launch, it will be the largest yacht in the world.
The yacht has a "lunar pool" and a submarine designed to study the ocean's depths.
On existing super-yachts, helicopter pads, open-air cinemas, and a platform for martial arts have become commonplace. Professor of economic anthropology at Indiana University in the United States, Richard Wilk says that compared to the total amount of greenhouse gas emissions, the carbon footprint of the super-rich is negligible.
But it has symbolic value, given that there are just over 2,000 billionaires in the world.
This is just another example of the overconsumption of a very small group of people.
Scientists found that the emissions footprint of the world's billionaires is thousands of times greater than that of the average person on the planet.
If one person produces an average of 5 tonnes of CO2 per year, then the planet's biggest polluter, Roman Abramovich, is responsible for 33.9 tonnes of greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere in 2018.
Two-thirds of the emissions were traced to his 162.5-metre yacht, the Eclipse.
Even if the owner is not on board, the crew continues to poison the planet.
The owner can call the captain and give the order to tow the yacht, for example, from the Mediterranean to the Caribbean.
The superyacht owners are not sympathetic to others when they, like Australia's richest woman Gina Rinehart, who owns mines on the continent, complain on YouTube that there is no place for their giant ships to dock.
It is also difficult to understand her call to build marinas for ships of 50 metres.
Dangerous weekly alcohol dose linked to bowel cancer
American scientists have determined how much alcohol a person drinks in a week increases their risk of developing cancer.
This is reported by the Daily Express.
Experts concluded that drinking four or more alcoholic drinks a week is linked to an increased risk of cancer.
In this case, the likelihood of developing the disease increases with the amount of alcohol consumed.
Moreover, men who drink moderately have a higher risk of bowel cancer than women.
The exact cause of this type of cancer is not known, but scientists note that certain factors lead to a harmful process in the body.

Dogs can understand words and phrases at the level of a two-year-old child
Many, or rather all dog lovers are convinced that these creatures are very smart.
But even they don't know how developed four-legged pets really are.
For many years, biologists have conducted various experiments to find out for sure how the animal's intelligence develops.
Although a dog's vocabulary is not as extensive as a human's, a new study has shown that a dog can respond to 89 words or phrases.
The researchers' work was published in the Sciencealert publication.
Dogs can't play chess or write poetry, they don't understand politics, economics or the arts, but they often manage to fool their owners.
Experts believe that some breeds are better at understanding human language, but the statistics are not yet accurate enough to draw firm conclusions.
For example, some breeds are traditionally considered canine geniuses - such as the Labrador.
Scientists have concluded that dogs are capable of logical thinking and that their ability to learn is comparable to that of a two-year-old child.

Ukraine is ready to trade with the United States and Russia
The United States and Russia will “trade” over Ukraine’s entry into NATO, said analyst Alexander Kochetkov in his article for the publication “Vremya Novostei”.
According to him, Washington and Moscow are planning to continue negotiations on the United States' guarantees that Ukraine will not join the North Atlantic Alliance, despite the words of the US leader Joe Biden about the right of countries "to join anywhere".
If you are offered something that is clearly unacceptable, for example, selling a close relative into sexual slavery, you will not bargain, but simply send the offeror away.
And with regard to Ukraine, a deal is expected," the analyst wrote.
Kochetkov added that Russia does not plan to attack Ukraine, but is seeking dialogue with Kiev.
"The training is conducted covertly, quickly and immediately moves on to offensive action, rather than waiting for the group to be detected and to deploy countermeasures," he noted.
China promotes the development of the railway transport industry
Cutting-edge Chinese technology attracted the attention of companies from the United States, Germany, France and other countries at the 2021 China International Rail Transport and Equipment Manufacturing Exhibition held in Zhuzhou City, Hunan Province, Central China.
The company's main technologies developed by CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co. Ltd. allow trains to automatically detect and diagnose technical faults, said Mr. Hou Zhaowen of the company.
High-speed trains running on the China-Laos Railway, which was put into operation earlier this month, are already equipped with these technologies, which will ensure increased reliability and operability of the rolling stock.
In the past six months, China has significantly increased its exports of railway vehicles, and many countries in Asia and Europe are witnessing the "Chinese speed".
In May this year, the first two-story high-speed electric trains developed in China by CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co., Ltd. rolled off the production line. They are intended for export to Europe.
With a maximum speed of 200 kilometres per hour, these trains will run on the Austrian, German, Hungarian and other European railways.
In November, the trial operation of the metro train developed by the aforementioned company for Turkey began.
The train will run along the metro line connecting the centre of Istanbul with the city's airport.
The metro line in this direction will open next year.
It will be the fastest metro line in Turkey with a speed of 120 kilometres per hour.
"China's railway equipment manufacturing industry is one of the industries with the highest level of innovation and the strongest international innovation competitiveness", said Feng Yajian, head of the trade and investment department of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade (CCPIT).
"This industry is the main competitive advantage of Chinese high-end equipment production in the world market," Feng Yajian said.
After more than 60 years of hard work, China has created a leading production system for railway equipment, with a full range of supporting facilities and large-scale production.
According to Feng Yajian, the country ranks first in the level of electrification of railways and in the operating mileage of high-speed and urban railways.
Biologist lists early signs of dementia
Candidate of Biological Sciences Semen Golosheikin in an interview with the radio station Sputnik listed the early signs of dementia.
He said that the signs of future dementia could include forgetfulness, as well as a whole range of mild cognitive impairments, such as the inability to concentrate, plan, and reduce the level of abstract thinking.
Hearing loss is currently being discussed as both an early sign of Alzheimer's disease and a risk factor for its development, a specialist said.
Golosheikin stressed that the causes of dementia can be neurodegenerative disorders, head injuries, some infections, metabolic disorders, and a lack of certain vitamins.
He added that Alzheimer's disease and atherosclerosis of the brain's blood vessels were the most common causes of this syndrome.
The biologist noted that to date, doctors do not know effective ways of treating dementia.
Therefore, it is necessary to start its prevention in time.
According to him, learning foreign languages and active communication will help reduce the risk of dementia.
WHO also recommends maintaining moderate physical activity, regularly training cognitive skills through games and hobbies that require intensive engagement of memory and logical thinking
"There are recommendations for the use of various BAs, but their effectiveness and usefulness are still being discussed in the scientific community," said Goloshchekin.
"The World Health Organization recommends maintaining a moderate level of physical activity, regular training of cognitive skills and abilities through games and hobbies that require intensive involvement of memory and logical thinking," said Goloshchekin.
Earlier, a dementia research charity in the UK said the disease is increasingly affecting people in their 40s.
Doctors have identified early symptoms of Alzheimer's disease.
The first warning sign can be a problem with vision, which makes it difficult for the patient to recognize objects.
Another sign of developing dementia, experts said, is aphasia, a condition in which a person cannot find the right words to express what he or she wants to say.
The neurologist demanded that Saakashvili be sent abroad for treatment
Former President of Georgia Mikheil Saakashvili needs psycho-neurological treatment and rehabilitation abroad, said neurologist Otar Toidze, who is part of the medical council set up by the Georgian ombudsman.
His neurological condition is the leading cause of his illness.
The stable problems are problems with movement, coordination, character variability," the specialist said, noting that this does not go beyond the norm and now the ex-president needs to be sent for special rehabilitation.
"This is what we call neurorehabilitation and psychoneurorehabilitation, which we did not find in Georgia," Toidezi said, demanding that Saakashvili be treated in a special facility, which does not exist in Georgia.
On December 7, Saakashvili began to sabotage the provision of medical care after the penitentiary service disciplined him.
The Georgian politician quickly managed to overturn the punishment and restore himself to his previous rights.

Protests against COVID passports took place in Spain
Protests against mandatory COVID-19 vaccination certificates took place in the Spanish cities of Barcelona and Valencia, Europa Press reports.
In the Catalan capital, the number of participants in the action was approximately 3,000.
In Barcelona, COVID passports have become mandatory for going to bars, restaurants, gyms, nursing homes and nightclubs.
Many of the protesters came to the rally without masks.
With slogans on their posters, they accused the state of totalitarianism and called on citizens to respect their choice.
In Valencia, vaccination passports will also be required to enter entertainment venues and restaurants with more than 50 seats.
Protesters in this city have declared a medical dictatorship, and vaccination has been called an experiment.
More than 5.2 million cases of coronavirus infection have been detected in Spain since the start of the pandemic, more than 88,000 patients have died.
Russia is also planning to introduce restrictions for the unvaccinated.
Government draft bills on a unified QR code system were submitted to the State Duma on November 12.
It is assumed that Russians will be able to visit places of mass events, cultural institutions, catering facilities and retail trade with the presentation of either a vaccination certificate or a certificate of a previous illness, or a vaccination certificate.
The same rules will apply to train and air travel.

A steep climb: how the Chinese are becoming alpine skiers
The Olympics should attract millions of people to the slopes and help create world-class resorts in the country
China hopes that the Olympics will not only attract 300 million citizens to participate in winter sports, which will help collect the 1 trillion yuan targeted by President Xi Jinping, but also promote the economic development of backward remote provinces.
The Taiwu ski resort, located near the site of the Winter Olympics, is becoming increasingly popular with Chinese people.
In addition to building infrastructure in the region, landscaping work is also being carried out: workers plant trees.
There are more than 700 ski resorts in the country, but only 20 of them are large enough to host international competitions.
In many regions of China where resorts are located, including Zhangjiakou, there are problems with snow.
The main goal in the long term is to provide comfortable and interesting holidays in Chinese resorts, so that all newcomers become regulars.
However, this is still a long way off.
Games adviser Justin Downs says the Chinese ski industry has changed beyond recognition since his last visit in 2007.
More and more Chinese are heading to the slopes in winter.
Fiona, a Beijing snowboarder, is one of them.
Despite the major changes, it will take many more years to create a ski culture here, says Downs.
Many resorts are located in agricultural and mining areas.
These regions still need to be actively developed and infrastructure for recreation needs to be created there.
70-year-old Gao Makong lives in Chungli, near the site of the Winter Olympics.
He notes that in recent years there has been a boom in winter sports tourism.
Two years ago, a high-speed railway was built from Beijing to Chongli, and now none of the local residents suffer from unemployment.
More and more shops are opening in the country that sell clothing and equipment for winter sports.
On the slopes, there are points of public catering with national cuisine dishes.
Now, Taiwan even has a COVID-19 testing station.
China is striving to create a thriving winter sports industry, its athletes to become leaders at major international competitions, and its resorts and equipment to reach world-class standards.
More than 500 million people in the world could face extreme poverty due to the pandemic, WHO says
More than 500 million people worldwide could be plunged into extreme poverty due to the coronavirus pandemic, which has stalled progress towards universal health coverage, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank (WB) said.
In the run-up to the International Day of Universal Health Coverage on 12 December, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank published two complementary reports.
They noted that the pandemic has caused disruptions in the provision of primary health care, excessive strain on health care systems.
In this regard, for the first time in 10 years, the coverage of the population with immunization decreased, the mortality from tuberculosis and malaria increased.
The WHO and the World Bank stressed that the pandemic has caused "the worst economic crisis since the 1930s, so people are finding it harder to pay for treatment".
This situation is pushing more than 500 million people into extreme poverty, because they have to pay for these services out of their own pockets.
In October, UN Secretary-General António Guterres said the coronavirus pandemic has pushed more than 100 million people into poverty, with more than four billion people virtually lacking social support.

Reuters: Taiwan minister suspended from White House 'Democracy Summit' call by request of White House
Taiwan's Minister of Digital Affairs Audrey Tang's speech at a panel discussion at the US-organized "Democracy Summit" was switched to a no-video mode, according to a recording of the summit on YouTube.
Reuters, citing sources, said the image was taken down at the request of the White House.
According to them, the reason was a map in which Taiwan was marked out in a different colour from the People's Republic of China, which considers the island to be its territory.
The map Ms Tan was showing was compiled by the South African civil society organisation CIVICUS and ranked countries according to their level of civil rights.
Taiwan was marked green as "free," while China, North Korea, Laos and Vietnam were marked red as "closed."
After the minister showed the map, the picture from her side was replaced with a screenshot with a note that the opinions of the participants "do not necessarily reflect the position of the US government."
China was not invited to the "Democracy Summit".
Reuters sources noted that the map shown by the Taiwanese minister could run counter to Washington's "One China" policy.
One of the agency's sources said the NSC had become angry after the map was shown, accusing the State Department of showing Taiwan as a separate country.
The Washington-organized "Democracy Summit" was held from December 9 to 10 with the participation of representatives of 110 countries and territories, as well as civil society and charitable organizations.
Russia was not invited to the summit.
During the “zero day” of the summit, the Nobel Peace Prize laureate, the editor-in-chief of Novaya Gazeta, Dmitry Muratov, called for the creation of an international fund through which money gained through corruption would be donated to charity.
Earlier today, Russian Deputy Secretary of the Security Council Yuri Avyaryanov stated that the summit was "anti-Russian and anti-Chinese."

New Shepard spacecraft with six tourists on board made suborbital flight
Blue Origin's New Shepard spacecraft with six tourists on board made a suborbital flight on Saturday, 11 December.
The journey, which was broadcast on the company's website, lasted for more than ten minutes, after which the capsule with the passengers descended to Earth, TASS reports.
The launch of the rocket was carried out from the cosmodrome in the vicinity of the American city of Van Horn (Texas).
The ship rose to an altitude of about 100 km, and the space tourists found themselves in a state of weightlessness.
The launch vehicle itself landed on the launch pad.
Blue Origin successfully conducted the first suborbital flight of the New Shepard spacecraft with passengers on board on July 20.

Don't lump them all together - there are bad people out there, and you may have a claim against them for a specific reason...
But what has this got to do with the number of children, age, pension fund and so on?
Write that they are "thieves who didn't return the money."
But how many and when they have children is none of your business until they get together and hang those kids on your neck.
But if that's out of the question, then what right do you have to condemn them?
Well, it's probably only in education...
The chosen (themselves) parents dictate their own rules, openly disregarding the existing ones.
And if this is to extend to other areas of life, such as the judicial system and so on?
For them, the laws are not written.
And if dad actually implements his parenting and education methods?
What a bad example for other people to follow.

China strengthens COVID-19 prevention and control in cities with land border crossings
The Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism of the State Council of the People's Republic of China has issued a circular requiring the strengthening of prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic in cities where land border checkpoints are located in order to further prevent the importation of the disease from abroad.
According to the circular, people leaving the mentioned cities must provide a negative nucleic acid test result for COVID-19 obtained within 48 hours before departure.
Those arriving in cities with land border crossings must take at least one COVID-19 nucleic acid test upon arrival.
The document states that these requirements will apply from the day that the relevant provincial-level administrative units define and publish the zones of the cities, until March 15, 2022.
In addition, it is noted that cities that have land border checkpoints and meet certain conditions may consider the possibility of creating buffer zones to prevent and control the COVID-19 epidemic within their jurisdiction.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported on the “sad conclusion” in relations between Russia and the United States
Deputy Foreign Minister of Russia Sergei Ryabkov in an interview with Izvestia assessed the prospects of relations between Moscow and Washington.
He noted that the long path of interaction has led to tragic conclusions, and the problems between the two countries did not start yesterday.
One-sided negative predictability is there, but in terms of some kind of prospects for improving relations, it's all completely unpredictable.
It's a sad conclusion to a long journey that we've been on with this administration, with Trump, and with Obama.
The problems started not yesterday," the diplomat said.
According to Ryabkov, the problems are related to the desire of the United States to impose approaches on Russia on a number of issues.
The deputy foreign minister added that he would not have risked making optimistic forecasts about the prospects for improving relations and would not have expected a change in Washington's position.
He explained that apart from areas such as strategic stability and cyber security, there has been no progress.
Russia, meanwhile, calls on the United States to take a responsible approach to international security issues and hopes that the signals will be heard and that Americans will listen to the arguments of common sense.
Earlier, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov stated at a meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken that Moscow was ready to resume dialogue with the United States.
Virologist warns of risks of COVID vaccine nasal spray outside hospital
People who have received the nasal COVID-19 vaccine may develop an allergic reaction and require medical assistance, so the first vaccination sites should not be set up in airports or shopping malls.
This was reported by TASS to a virologist, a corresponding member of the Russian Academy of Sciences, the head of the laboratory of bionanotechnology, microbiology and virology of the Novosibirsk State University, Sergei Netesov.
It's easier to set up nasal vaccine points in airports and shopping centres, but I would only do it in the first instance in medical facilities.
The fact is that the possibility of an allergic reaction to such a vaccine exists, it is small, but it is desirable that the person sits next to the doctor's office afterwards.
Doctors have special sets of anti-allergy drugs that work literally within minutes or two, which is sometimes very important," Netesov said.
According to the virologist, it will be possible to think about vaccination in shopping malls when the experience of using the drug is accumulated.
He also stressed that when using a nasal vaccine, it is important that it reaches the mucous membrane in the nasal cavity.
However, there is a possibility that the vaccine will not reach its destination if the person being vaccinated sneezes after the injection.

The true believers make up the church, say the lamas.

But no one should say of himself or of anyone else who believes as he does that they alone are true believers.
Because if they can say that they are true believers, then surely others can say the same.

In the UK, 1239 cases of the omicron coronavirus strain were recorded in one day - RT in Russian
In one day, 1,239 cases of infection with the new omicron strain of the coronavirus have been identified in the UK.
Sky News reports this.
In particular, 1,196 new cases of the Omicron strain were recorded in England, 38 people were infected with the new strain in Scotland and five in Northern Ireland.
The total number of people infected with the new strain of COVID-19 in the UK has reached 3,137.
Earlier, scientists at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine made a pessimistic forecast, according to which, by April, 75,000 people could die in England due to the outbreak of the coronavirus caused by the "Omicron" strain.
Peskov warned about the suffering of western countries that impose anti-Russian sanctions
The press secretary of the President of the Russian Federation, Dmitry Peskov, commented on the possible introduction of anti-Russian sanctions in the event of continued “aggressive actions” against Ukraine, including due to the alleged “invasion” of the country’s territory.
“It is impossible to impose restrictions on Russia and not feel the pain yourself”, the official representative of the Kremlin said on the air of the Rossiya 1 TV channel.
Peskov says this is "understood by everyone in the world."
Earlier it was reported that the United States is considering the possibility of introducing anti-Russian sanctions in the energy sector as an extreme measure.
In addition, Washington and the European Union are planning to introduce restrictions that will make it more difficult to convert rubles into dollars in relation to Russian banks and the Russian Direct Investment Fund.
At the same time, the head of Sberbank, Herman Gref, is convinced that this is impossible.

New Caledonia rejects idea of independence from France
According to the final results of the third independence referendum in New Caledonia, the overwhelming majority of participants refused to leave France.
This was reported by the French TV channel BFM.TV on December 12.
96.5% of voters voted against independence.
3.51% of the archipelago's inhabitants in the South Pacific Ocean supported independence from France.
The results of 2.99% of the ballots were annulled.
Turnout on the day was very low: about 55% of the archipelago's population turned out to vote.
According to experts, the low turnout is explained by calls by separatists to abandon participation in the referendum due to the coronavirus.
Paris has refused to move the referendum date.
In October 2020, the residents of New Caledonia voted against independence from France in a referendum.
A referendum on independence was already held in the region in 2018.
Most of the residents supported the archipelago being part of France.
New Caledonia is almost 20,000 kilometres from mainland France.
In 1853, France declared New Caledonia its possession.
About 270,000 people live on the archipelago, the territory has a special administrative-territorial status.
A 1998 agreement between Paris and the New Caledonia administration stipulates that the region can hold a referendum on its independence every two years.

WHO preliminary considers Omicron less dangerous than Delta
The World Health Organization (WHO) has preliminarily concluded that "Omicron" is less dangerous than the Delta strain of the coronavirus.
However, there are data on the reduced effectiveness of vaccines against the new COVID-19 variant.
As of December 9, Omicron has been registered in 63 countries.
"Preliminary data and a significantly altered antigen profile of the strain "omicron" suggest a reduced effectiveness of the vaccine against infection and transmission of the variant.
Preliminary findings from South Africa suggest that it (the "severity of the disease" - rare) may be less severe than that of "delta"", the World Health Organization said in a technical report.
The organization notes that so far, all registered cases of omicron infection in the EU have been mild or asymptomatic.
At the same time, the new strain is spreading faster than the “Delta”.
There have been two cases of infection with the omicron strain in Russia.
They were "previously immunized," the Gamaleya Center said.
The head of Rospotrebnadzor, Anna Popova, stated that there are no reliable data on whether the new coronavirus variant is less dangerous than the others.

Four scenarios have been named for Zelensky in Ukraine
Former Verkhovna Rada deputy Vadim Denisenko listed four scenarios for President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky in 2022.
In his opinion, the head of state can remain without the support of the West, and perhaps will compromise on the Donbass.
On Sunday, December 12, Denisenko told about this in a publication on the website “Glavred”.
The first option, which Denisenko called "the ideal storm," would see key Western countries stop supporting Ukraine, reaching an agreement on the country's future without its participation.
Such a development will contribute to a deep crisis that Ukraine may face in 2023.
"At the same time, there is a decrease in the prices of key goods that we traditionally export ... internal protests and confrontation with key FPGs (financial and industrial groups. - Ed.) ", the former parliamentarian added.
According to Denisenko, there is another scenario for the situation to develop - "a war against everyone."
This forecast will come true in the event of high political turbulence, in which the Ukrainian authorities will face a number of problems.
As a result of this situation, the Ukrainian leadership may be forced to make compromises on Donbas, which could lead to a confrontation within the country.
By the end of the summer, Zelensky's position will weaken, the likelihood of such a situation, according to the former deputy, is up to 50-55%.
The third option for the development of the situation in Ukrainian politics is the confrontation of the disagreeing with Zelensky groups of the population and the president, which would lead to the seizure of control over the power bloc and the implementation of "populist initiatives".
In this scenario, Zelensky would begin “restructuring of power”, added Denisenko.
Another scenario is to turn Zelensky into "the father of the nation."
This may be triggered by some event that will cause a great shock to society.
"The event should be large enough to provoke a reaction from external partners and lead to an increase in support for Ukraine," Denisenko said.
Such a scenario is possible as a result of a natural disaster, a technological catastrophe or Russia's aggressive actions, believes the former deputy.
At the same time, the Russian side has already rejected any possibility of an “attack” on Ukraine.
In Moscow, it was noted that it was the Ukrainian authorities, NATO and the United States that increased military activity near the Russian borders.
Earlier, on November 11, the data of the sociological group “Rating” showed that the rating of the Ukrainian president fell to record low levels, reaching 19.3%.
It is the lowest figure since he was elected head of state.
Analysts predicted a situation in which, in the event of the upcoming presidential elections in Ukraine, only 21.8% would vote for Zelensky, while 14.5% would vote for the country's former president, Petro Poroshenko.
At the same time, only 19.3% of all respondents expressed support for the president.

Thank you to the author for the story about the great athlete, I did not know that Elena Shushunova had died, it is very sad to learn this.
I remember how I cheered her on at the Olympics in Seoul, for us, residents of Primorye, it was a live broadcast, real time.
Such a passion, the emotions were overwhelming, I remember the joy when Elena won.
They also rejoiced in the other victories, as they cheered for Salnikov, the footballers, and all the then Soviet athletes.
I once saw a documentary about one of the Central American countries and there were melons rolled up the ship's ladder like barrels.
The melons were enormous.
I myself have worked many times as a young man in the harvesting and loading of watermelons in the Astrakhan region and have never seen a watermelon weighing more than a pound.
I buy the melons weighing 4-5 kg directly from the stand and not before the beginning of August.
A balconette with soft lace cups (size: 90E, color: beige, composition: 90% polyamide, 10% elastane, article: 12008).
A balconette bra with soft lace cups, on a frame.
The bottom of the cup is reinforced with an inelastic transparent plastic.
The lateral inner part of the cup, in the area of the seam, is reinforced with non-elastic fabric in the fold, without additional seams for comfort.
This element prevents the lace from stretching.
The richness of the lace can be gauged by the festoon along the neckline and under the bust.
Vertical ribs on the side panels of the single-layer microfiber prevent the fabric from twisting at large sizes.
I really didn't like the article, it was mean and poisonous.
They walked past people they didn't know.
But now, this is being liked by many, people are breaking up into atoms.
I hope that those who comment with honor and decency have all the way and they are experts in everything.

The poet arrested for the action on Red Square: "For a quote by Yevtushenko, they give 10 days, that's it, the power of poetry!"
On the first day of the week, 21-year-old poet Alexander Volchenkov was arrested for ten days.
A student of the Higher School of Economics was detained in Red Square with a placard on which the hashtag #poetyvrossiiboleechtopoety was written.
This quote is attributed to the writer Yevgeny Evtushenko.
A protocol was drawn up against Alexander under an administrative article for repeated violation of the rules for conducting a public action.
He was first detained on January 23 on Pushkin Square, at a rally in support of Alexei Navalny.
"The goal was to draw attention to poetry in general, but now interest in it, unfortunately, has disappeared, to the decline of the general culture in Russia and also a small hope to inspire unknown poets to write their poems on the Internet under this hashtag," Alexander explains.
We have contacted the young poet to find out the circumstances of his arrest and to clarify the message of his message in more detail.
How did the police officers treat you when you were arrested this time and previously?
What did the department ask about your action, and how did they comment on it?
This time the staff were more polite, the detention was kept to a minimum, courteous as it might sound in a certain context of the word.
On Pushkinskaya, the OMONs took the OMONs and took it hard.
They asked the standard questions about motives.
When you heard it, you basically looked at it either approvingly or understandingly.
Except for the four-way monkey, everything was perfectly correct, but I knew what I was getting into.
And if after the action, a few people start writing their poems under this hashtag, I will not be spending the next 10 days in jail for nothing.
According to the protocol, you should speak the language of the Tumba-Yumba tribe in private.
At public and official events, they speak in the language of the people around them so that everyone understands what happened in the Bundestag on 25 September 2001, or in their native language through an interpreter.
This is the protocol and nothing more, by the way, Angela Merkel speaks Russian fluently and still uses an interpreter.
And at official events, stenography is still done by hand, and the stenographer does not have to know several languages.

It is beneficial to the gastrointestinal tract and can also help prevent hypertension and atherosclerosis with regular use.
However, for the greatest benefit, the root vegetable should be stewed or boiled, not fried in oil.
Earlier, The Daily Express warned that potatoes can be dangerous for diabetics, as well as other foods with a high glycemic index.
These are foods with a high carbohydrate content that break down quickly into sugars, such as sugar-sweetened soft drinks, white rice, and white bread.
In early December, Kommersant warned of a possible shortage of Russian table potatoes, noting a decrease in its production in private farms and an increase in processing capacity.
According to market participants, the current shortage of products can only be replaced by imports.
Lostfilm, lordfilm and other pirates have been removed from Yandex’s collection
Candidates for the exit
In 2015, the copyright holders from the RAEC/Media cluster compiled a list of the 100 largest pirate websites in Russia, and most of them ceased to exist, says Karen Kazaryan, the head of the Internet Research Institute.
But some - Kinogo, Lostfilm, Filmix - have managed to survive, thanks in part to regular domain name changes, he adds.
For example, on Lostfilm, which is available in search results as both Yandex and Google, you can watch the Netflix series "Squid Game" and "Tenderness" by director Anna Melikyan - the original series of Russia's largest video service ivi (part of AIV).
On Kinogo, which is also available on search engines, you can watch the animated novelty "Encanto", but judging by the quality of the video, it is a so-called screen (a pirated copy of the film shot in a cinema).
Filmix, which can also be found through search engines, has the series “Univer. 10 Years Later” of the TNT channel (part of “Gazprom-media”).

I watched her interview and she said her biggest dream was to grow wings, and her dad is constantly trying to make that happen.

The wide circle, framed by "molecules" of light, provides the most uniform and bright illumination of the space.
"Atomic" or "molecular" design, reflecting the nature and natural essence of each object, is not losing its relevance and allows you to advantageously place accents in the interior.
One of the distinctive features of such lamps is their weightlessness.

Dimax Micro Ultimate mattress, 160x190
Orthopedic spring mattress Micro Ultimet.
The model is convenient because it has two different softnesses – high hardness and slightly more than average.
Only high-quality and premium fillers were included in the product, which have proven themselves exclusively in the best way.
Springs: The center of the model is fitted with a block of independent springs “micro-pack”.
This means that there are 2,000 coils, which are completely autonomous.
It is their functioning that gives them a unique point-by-point adjustment.
The "Micropack" is the highest-frequency of all the Dimax spring blocks, so it has a pronounced orthopedic effect and is considered premium.
Fillers: The top and bottom of the springs are made up of layers of coir and natural latex.
The only difference is the order of the plates.
If one surface is latex, the other is coconut coir.
Such a combination of fillers has long been considered a classic, since it gives the mattress not only orthopedic, but also anatomical properties.
If the collar provides proper support for the back, then the latex provides a surface adaptation to the human body.
Cover: The model comes in a plain knitted Aloe Vera cover.
The client can have it made either as a mobile or as a fixed unit.
The overall height of the product is 27 cm, the recommended load for the bed is 170 kg.
Warranty and safety: the warranty period is 3 years.
The mattress has received all the necessary certificates and documents confirming its full safety and reliability in operation.
The orthopedic foam used in the mattress has CertiPUR certification.
Estonian scientists will search for life on Venus
Massachusetts Institute of Technology in collaboration with Tartu Observatory and other research institutions and companies is preparing three missions to Venus to search for signs of life in the atmosphere, the "Actual Camera" reported on Sunday.
The goal of the five-year missions is to assess Venus's habitability and then search for life there.
For the project, Tartu scientists proposed tools for measuring the acidity and oxygen content of Venus' clouds.
So far, it has been assumed that the clouds of Venus, the planet closest to Earth, are too acidic to support life, but it is likely that Venus was originally a terrestrial planet.
A sample from Venus should arrive on the third mission.
If we find life there, the main question will be whether it is similar to life on Earth or different.
If it is very similar, then it will be obvious that terrestrial life did not start on Earth.
If it is different, then it may be more likely that life began on Earth," said Mihkel Pajusalu, head of the Estonian team of the Venus Life Finder project.

Metaverses will change Russian business
The metaverse has become a hot topic this fall, when Mark Zuckerberg announced that Facebook would become Meta.
For the market, this event was a significant signal: the largest player confirmed the development of a new format of digital interaction between people.
Therefore, businesses in Russia, as in the rest of the world, will invest in creating their own metaverses and subsequently monetize them.
The metaverse should be viewed as a continuation of the objectively existing trends.
On the one hand, the trend towards creating remote interactions, because people are tired of being isolated and restricted.
On the other hand, this is a consequence of the desire of businesses to develop ecosystems and adapt their operating models to them.
The third is that they are a logical continuation of the trend of digitising assets, where any rights, securities, works of art and even money move into a digital format.
Anna, you're right, changing your diet is a conscious process.
When you start eating right, you don't want to eat anything too fatty or unhealthy.
Of course, we'll have the traditional olivier and herring for the feast, but no one is forcing me to eat it all at once.
You can eat it by the spoonful, try it and that's enough.
After all, there are ten days ahead, and you can prepare any tasty and healthy dishes.
And how much hellish work, time and money it took her to train.

And she also understands that four years before the next Olympics, she will not be able to last, i.e. she will never be an Olympic champion.
And the one who hasn't done just sports or can't imagine all the circles of hell she's been through, DON'T FUCK AROUND.
British economist could not give a forecast for 2022
British economist Jim O'Neill was unable to give a forecast for 2022, as he believes such attempts will fail.
He wrote about it in an article for Project Syndicate.
The expert believes that the next year will be full of unpredictability and any trend can change the course.
The most important factor remains the coronavirus pandemic, he believes.
O'Neill also admitted he doesn't know if the rise in commodity prices is temporary or not.
As the expert noted, even before the pandemic, it was clear that "the world of infinite central bank largesse had outlived itself" and it was time to return to a relationship where interest rates adjusted for inflation matched expected growth in GDP.
O'Neill noted that in the context of the pandemic, the continuation of the ultra-soft economic policy could, according to some experts, lead to a new wave of inflation.
In addition, attention should be paid to the issue of productivity growth, as well as poverty levels and climate change, O'Neill concluded.
Earlier, the head of the global research department of “Open Investment” Mikhail Shulgin reported that positive expectations for the dollar exchange rate for 2022 remain, while the potential for growth will be less significant.
Among the risks for the dollar, Shulgin named the monetary policy of the Fed, the dynamics of oil prices and fears in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.
She had to agree.
But the good news is that if you compare yourself to five years ago, there were fewer containers.
Now it is better.
Progress is there, only slow.
There is another problem: there are a lot of environmental initiatives in cities, but people don't know about them.
Any eco-taxis that take the trash out of the house.
It's a simple point of reception for the waste - it's used by the marginals.

Russians gave auto dealers about 4.5% of the country's GDP
According to the results of 10 months of 2021, Russians spent 2 trillion 784 billion rubles on buying new cars, which is 28% more than in the same period of the previous year, according to the statistics of the Russian Automotive Market Research (RAMP) agency.
To understand the scale - about the same amount (about 3 trillion rubles) was spent by the state to support citizens and the economy during the coronavirus pandemic.
Last September, at a meeting of the heads of states of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, President Vladimir Putin said that the amount was comparable to more than 4.5% of the country's gross domestic product (GDP) for 2020.
In terms of revenues, the Korean brand Kia leads the Russian market.
In 10 months of this year, he managed to sell cars worth 32.57 billion rubles, which is almost 24% more than last year.
The growth of the sister brand of Kia, Hyundai, is even more significant - more than 35%, and the revenue from the sale of cars is estimated at 27.93 billion rubles.
In the lead, this brand is also in the lead in terms of increasing the average price of the car - for a year, Hyundai's average price increased by almost 21%, to 1.94 million rubles - only Changan, Chery, Geely and Mercedes-Benz had a stronger price increase.
At the same time, the sales volumes of Korean brands did not grow so much: according to the statistics of the Committee of Automakers of the Association of European Business in Russia, Kia sold 9.4% more cars over the same period than the previous year.
Hyundai - almost 12%.
The Japanese Toyota closes the top three in terms of sales volume in monetary terms - Russians spent 27.55 billion rubles on cars of this brand in 10 months, which is 14% more than a year ago.
Japanese are followed by Mercedes-Benz with a figure of 26.61 billion rubles (+75%) - the German premium brand has increased both the volume of sales (by 37%) and the average price of the car (by almost 28%, to 8.2 million rubles).
"Mercedes-Benz is simultaneously experiencing a good increase in sales and a weighted average price - more, for example, than BMW - hence the greater increase in financial capacity, explained the General Director of NAPI Tatyana Arabaeva. -
In terms of sales growth, Chinese brands have also significantly increased their financial capacity this year."
The Russian Lada in the dynamics of income growth demonstrates average figures (plus 28%), for cars of this brand Russians spent 22.94 billion rubles in 10 months.
At the level of last year, the companies are those whose sales of cars in units in 2021 fell: in particular, Volkswagen, Mitsubishi and Nissan.
UAZ is in the red - in 10 months, Russians spent 12 billion rubles on off-road vehicles and pick-ups of this brand against 12.4 billion rubles a year earlier.
Against the backdrop of problems with the supply of auto components and production disruptions affecting the entire global auto industry, auto companies continue to continuously adjust prices - the same "AvtoVAZ" raised the prices of Lada models seven times in a year, the last price increase (by 8-10 thousand rubles) took place at the end of November.
Regularly, they rewrite their price lists for their own products and those of other automakers.
The volume of the Russian automobile market in monetary terms will continue to grow - in addition to the shortage of cars, inflation is also contributing to this, as well as the desire of carmakers to make up for past losses, experts say.
In the face of a car shortage, I think many carmakers have even managed to pass on some of the costs of past periods that they couldn't put into the price of cars before,
Vladimir Bespalov, an analyst at VTB Capital, says: -
I think the financial side of the automakers is doing very well right now, maintaining high margins on sales."
An indirect indicator of this is the growth rate of car prices, which is observed in 2021, the expert explains.
In the long run, the market will grow both in terms of quantity and in terms of money, but mainly due to inflation and the complexity of the design of the machines themselves, predicts Bespalov.
As supply increases, opportunities to raise prices will be limited.
In monetary terms, the Russian car market will continue to grow in the coming year, even if the growth in the cost of cars slows down, notes independent automotive consultant Sergey Burgazliev.
Given the increased demand and low supply, automakers are now trying to get the highest profit from each car sold, notes Burgazliev. -
The increase in production volumes is not expected in the near future, and the enthusiasm of citizens in Russia is also being fueled by their uncertainty about the future.
Against the backdrop of the situation on the market, cars have turned out to be a good investment object - a car bought a year ago, even with mileage, can now be sold for more than its original cost, the expert notes.
Biden has spoken about sending US troops to Ukraine in the event of a Russian invasion
U.S. leadership has never considered sending American troops to Ukraine in the event of a "Russian invasion."
The U.S. President, Joe Biden, made the announcement.
"There has never been such a plan," the White House chief said in response to a reporter's question about whether the United States had abandoned the idea.
Biden noted that if the situation around Ukraine escalates, Russia will face economic consequences.
At the same time, he stressed that the United States and NATO have no obligation to use military force to protect Ukraine in the event of escalation.
The American leader also stated that the possibility of using American troops unilaterally for the defense of Ukraine is not on the agenda.
Biden explained that if Russia invaded Ukraine, the United States would send forces to Eastern European NATO countries (Bulgaria, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Czech Republic and Estonia).
"We're going to have to send more American and NATO troops to the eastern flank, B9 - all the NATO countries that we have a sacred obligation to defend against any attack from Russia," Biden said.
Earlier, the press secretary of the President of Russia, Dmitry Peskov, noted that Moscow does not have any intentions to invade the territory of Ukraine.
At the same time, he noted that Moscow sees the problem in the combat use of Turkish drones by Kiev, as well as in the fact that "American weapons are approaching our territory."
I just get out of such interviews.

A moderately firm mattress is more relevant for those who need to "unload" their backs and maintain a healthy posture.
The mattress is perfect for one person or a couple.
The latter will especially appreciate the presence of a stable surface and the absence of the "wave" effect, where the oscillations on one side of the mattress can be transmitted to the opposite, disturbing a person in sleep.

If a fraudster calls from such a number, like an "employee of the Ministry of Internal Affairs" or another law enforcement agency, then it is not effective to drop the call immediately, and it is unlikely that you will be able to blacklist the number in time.
Because to confirm his lie about his connection to the security forces, he quickly repeats the challenge and continues to intimidate and persuade.

The "Assortment No. 2" wool set is 100% merino wool, wool 4x10 g.
Wool shearing as a craft began eight thousand years ago, but it was very difficult to find animal wool, and even more difficult to find colored wool.

Maria Kartazova, what does this mean?
I don't voice my thoughts, I mentally curse you all.
I mentally cut off the heads of everyone who didn't give me a seat, I mentally sent them to the guillotine and burned all the cars that were in my way, in my mind, everything!
And from the looks of it, I can even smile at you.
But I remember that the thought is material!

The film of the student Alexander Sokurov received the European "Oscar" for the best editing
The Russian film "Holding Hands" nominated for the "Oscar" award received the award of the European Film Academy (also called the "European Oscar") in the "Best Editing" category, reports "Moskovsky Komsomolets".
The competition jury, voting online due to the complex epidemiological situation, assessed the outstanding craftsmanship of the film's creators.
This time, the maximum number of awards went to the film Jasmila Žbanić (Bosnia) "Where are you going, Aida?"
The main character of the film is a translator with the UN mission who is trying to save her family during the war in Yugoslavia.
As for the film "Punching in the Face," directed by Kira Kovalenko (a graduate of Alexander Sokurov's workshop), this film tells about the complicated relationship between an authoritarian father and the children who want to break free from their father's custody in North Ossetia.
Previously, it was announced that the film was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film.
As regular friendly meetings between the presidents of Russia, Azerbaijan, Turkey, I think, show, you are, to put it mildly, not in the right place.
Only yesterday, the President of Azerbaijan approved the opening of a joint Azerbaijani-Russian KamAZ plant.
