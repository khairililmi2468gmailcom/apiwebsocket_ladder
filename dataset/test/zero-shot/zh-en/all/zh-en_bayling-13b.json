Of course, corresponding systems need to be established, but the key is that teachers need to have a comprehensive grasp of the teaching situation. They should not only understand the teaching content, but also the learning situation of students. Only in this way can teaching and learning be better connected, and a positive interaction be established. The examination will also be more in line with the actual situation, so that “学霸” and “学渣” can each find their place.",
